2024-04-09 00:05:00+00:00,"Meet the Cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock According to These Key Financial Metrics","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are seven tech companies that have come to be known as the ""Magnificent Seven.""Although investors usually target this bunch for their growth potential, some may wonder which Magnificent Seven stock is the least expensive.Based on a few popular valuation metrics, Apple stands out as the best all-around value of the group. Here's why Apple is inexpensive relative to its top tech peers.For younger, unprofitable companies, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio can be a good metric for evaluating a stock and its value relative to its revenue. But for more mature, industry-leading companies -- which includes all of the Magnificent Seven -- the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is arguably a better metric.But accounting nuances can sometimes inflate or discount a company's earnings. A one-off impairment charge or gain from the sale of assets don't reflect core operations. With that in mind, looking at the P/E ratio in tandem with price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) can give investors a more accurate representation of a company's valuation.Not long ago, Alphabet was the least expensive Magnificent Seven stock. But a 15% rally for the stock in the past month has pushed its valuation higher. Meanwhile, Apple is down 3% over the same period.As a result, Apple now has the lowest P/E ratio of the Magnificent Seven stocks.And it also has the lowest P/FCF multiple at 25.Since Dec. 2023, Apple's P/E valuation has fallen enough that it now trades at a discount to the S&P 500. But there are some good reasons for this.The abridged version of Apple's woes: Its growth has ground to a halt. The company is facing negative sales growth in China, and it hasn't monetized artificial intelligence (AI) in a meaningful way, while the majority of the Magnificent Seven have. A core reason Microsoft overtook Apple to become the most valuable company in the world is its short- and long-term runway for leveraging AI across its business segments.Apple's lack of iPhone innovation has been a concern for years. But maybe more alarming is the dry spell in its new product development pipeline. The Apple Vision Pro is the latest product, but it remains to be seen if that will pay off in the same way as past products like the iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and others. Besides the Vision Pro, Apple hasn't released a showstopper product since the AirPods in Sept. 2016.This is still a massively profitable company that can buy back a boatload of its own stock while raising its dividend, which can help make the valuation more attractive even when growth is slow. But what Apple really needs is innovation.On Mar. 26, Apple announced its annual Worldwide Developers Conference will take place at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, from June 10 to June 14. To quote the announcement:Free for all developers, WWDC24 will spotlight the latest iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS advancements. As part of Apple's ongoing commitment to helping developers elevate their apps and games, the event will also provide them with unique access to Apple experts, as well as insight into new tools, frameworks, and features.The stakes are high for two reasons. The first is that this is an opportunity for Apple to flex its technological advancements with product announcements likely to come during its annual September unveiling event. The second is the company's relationship with developers is the spotlight of the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple.Apple is in a unique position because it needs to show progress while also conveying that it's treating developers fairly.Negative sentiment has mounted against Apple, in contrast to the many tech giants now enjoying AI-fueled valuation expansions.Despite this near-term pressure, Apple's core investment thesis hasn't really changed. It's still an industry-leading company with arguably the most impressive vertical integration on the planet. An investment in Apple is about its multi-decade runway in consumer electronics, the integration and value add of services like Apple TV and Apple Music, and new product developments.The company may face some near-term challenges, but its stock shouldn't trade at a discount to the broad market. Investors who have been watching Apple are now getting an opportunity to buy its stock at a good value. However, they'll need to be patient as it could take a while for Apple to regain favor.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-08 17:30:00+00:00,Could Apple Help You Retire a Millionaire?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made a lot of millionaires over the years, with its shares up 792% over the last decade. However, it hit some roadblocks in 2024, with its stock down 11% year to date.Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.However, outperforming estimates hasn't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of Apple's business. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales yet they fell 13% in China. The East Asian country increasingly prefers domestic brands over the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.Then, on March 4, Apple's stock dipped again after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service. Despite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. The question remains: Is Apple still a millionaire maker, and could it make you one by the time you retire?It's hard to deny Apple's powerful position in tech. The company has leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows that Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.While declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.Moreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance. As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.Apple is on a promising growth path and has a long history of reliability. Its dominant role in tech and investments in budding industries like VR/AR and artificial intelligence (AI) will likely fuel its stock price for years.This chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 yields a share price of $208, projecting stock growth of 23% over the next two fiscal years. These projections would likely see Apple continue to outperform the S&P 500, which has increased by 13% over the last two years.As a result, Apple's stock remains an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio. Its significant cash reserves and potent brand make it an excellent option to hold over many years, as one does when preparing for retirement. I wouldn't bet against Apple's reliability and tendency to deliver major gains over the long term.If you're less than five years from retirement, there are likely better options than Apple as it will need time to overcome recent headwinds. However, if you're an early stage investor with 20 or more years to go, the right investment can help make you a millionaire by the time you retire, and Apple stock could play a useful part in helping you achieve that goal.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-08 16:02:34+00:00,Spotify Goes A Step Further On Its AI Journey,"Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) continues to integrate AI into its music streaming offerings. On Friday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced changes that should benefit Spotify and other streaming apps as it will now inform users of other ways to purchase digital services on its App Store. This change came as result the $1.99 billion fine Apple was charged by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through its Apple Store restrictions.Perhaps not the greatest rivalry of all time, but the Apple Music and Spotify rivalry is undoubtedly among the music streaming industry’s greats. Spotify has been around for longer than Apple Music. Yet, Apple made an impressive digital music footprint and used its iPhone power to make things trickier for Spotify. By the looks of it, the EU regulators have put an end to those days. Strangely, Apple has been late in in infusing AI to enhance its offerings. While Apple has been keeping quiet on AI, it did add personalized recommendations last year, back when Spotify expanded its AI DJ. Generative AI has quickly grown to become much more than a simple buzzword, so Apple cannot afford to take a back seat but it’s nature has always been about being secretive- only time will show how it intends to infuse it across its offerings.Last February, Spotify launched its AI-powered DJ feature. Six months after the North America and Canada debut, it expanded it to dozens of markets across the globe. An English-speaking personalized radio DJ has been a success. Now, Spotify took the next step by launching personalized AI playlists that one can build using written prompts. Moreover, besides allowing users to specify their musical wishes beyond the genre with prompts referencing a range of things, from moods to movie characters, activities, and so on, AI can be used to further refine the result after the list is generated. At first, the feature will be available to U.K. and Australia.Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has also offered many teasers of ways the music streaming company can exploit AI, such as by summarizing podcasts and creating AI-generated audio ads. With AI-powered capabilities, Spotify can personalize its offerings like never before while also gaining the ability to become more efficient such as by significantly lowering the cost that it takes for advertisers to develop new ad formats. In simple words, the DJ feature was merely the beginning of Spotify’s AI journey.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

2024-04-08 15:38:51+00:00,"Tesla, Apple, Nvidia: Factors keeping these stocks popular","Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — often referred to as members of the Magnificent 7 group of tech stocks — have had varying performances in 2024 so far. According to a new report from Charles Schwab, these tech leaders continue to remain popular among retail investors going forward.Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks.Mazzola expands upon the report and why these stocks remain popular: ""I think with Nvidia, you can make case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear under performers in the Mag. 7 at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino[AUDIO LOGO]JARED BLIKRE: Two stocks investors are keeping an eye on, Tesla and Apple. Tesla is the biggest loser year-to-date in the S&P 500, down about 33%, 34% as of Friday. Apple down 12%. Now, a new report from Charles Schwab shows that they continue to remain popular among retail investors.And let's bring in now Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab director of trading and education to discuss more. Joe, not a big surprise here. We have what we call Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers, and it's based on the traffic to all our ticker pages. And guess what? Nvidia, Tesla, Apple almost always rounding out the top three here.JOE MAZZOLA: Yeah. No, I think with Nvidia, you can make the case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack there. And I think with Apple and Tesla, I mean, look, retail investors tend to look for dip-buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past.And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear underperformers in the Mag Seven at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago.SEANA SMITH: Joe, what's driving that investor confidence that you clearly are seeing over the last several months? And then when we look ahead to the future, what is that indicative of just in terms of some of the future trends that we could potentially see?JOE MAZZOLA: Well, let me just throw some numbers on there. So the STAX number that we came out with-- and remember, this is based upon activity. So this is behavioral index as opposed to attitudinal-- jumped up to 51.65 this month or this past month in March. That's an 8% jump over February. Takes us to levels that we haven't seen since May of '22.Now, to put that in context, it's still well below the levels that we saw in the meme stocks of 2021, but it might take a while before we see something like that again. So it's in a range where it's starting to show a lot of investor confidence. And I think a lot of that has to stem from the economy showing a firm stance and that it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner.I think you came out of a Q1 where earnings beat expectations fairly handily. Expectations, I think, were a little bit low from the analyst community. But the earnings beat was good. And investors are looking for a couple of factors. We talk about multifactor analysis. Two of the factors that we hear and that we talk about with our investor base quite a bit is positive earnings revisions. So you look at a company like Nvidia that they're the leaders of the pack there.But a couple of other things like free cash flow and then interest coverage ratio, meaning can they are they generating enough profits, revenues, and cash flow to pay off that debt, especially when you're seeing interest rates at these levels? Those are becoming extremely popular factors for our investors to look at.JARED BLIKRE: Well, since we're heading into earnings season right now, let me just ask you on the cusp of earnings season here, so what trends do you think-- you've been putting out this survey or basically you've been gathering these statistics for some time. Do they say anything about what we should expect for the current earnings season?JOE MAZZOLA: Well, I think one of the things to expect when we're looking at the sectors that were purchased in March, IT was a clear favorite. I mean, way above some of the other sectors. But we did see some net buying in health, and we did see some net buying and utilities and materials back in February.And those turned out to be prescient buys, kind of given what they did in the month of March. So it's really staples, health care, and IT for March were the biggest inflows. We did see some inflows in fixed income as well too. Now, I will say this. I think that relative to maybe Q4 earnings that came out in January and February, Q1 earnings, the bar's a little bit higher.We're not seeing the analyst community kind of lower the bar to the same extent that they did for the last quarter. So the bar is set a bit high. We'll get a better indication of that kicking off this Friday with a lot of the financial names. But I think it's kind of put up or shut up time right now for the market kind of given some of the valuations.SEANA SMITH: So put up or shut up time right now for the market. Joe, real quick, let's talk about some of the activity that we've seen or interest, I should say, in some of those traditional meme names, the volatility that we've seen in GameStop, some interest again in AMC. And then you put Reddit into that category following its IPO. Did that at all show up in your index and some of the activity? And if not, I guess, what does that tell us just in terms of the split that we're seeing between the retail investor versus what we're seeing on the sell side?JOE MAZZOLA: So I think one of the things that I found very interesting when I looked at the net sales number one on the list was Coinbase. So it's a bit of an ancillary play from what you're talking about there. But Bitcoin, with the rally that it had in Q1, Coinbase was up almost 60% before the pullback that we saw in March. And clients trimmed into that.And I think one of the big differences, like I said, between this time right now, we even seeing that 8% bump in the STAX relative to maybe 2021 is clients are more discerning when it comes to some of those SPAC names and they're a bit more discerning when it comes to the meme names. I think if you go back to 2022, yeah, look, they got burned a little bit on those names. And they're not they're not scooping them at the same levels that we maybe saw them in the past.JARED BLIKRE: All right. We've got to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights.

2024-04-08 15:05:59+00:00,Apple changes App Store rules to allow retro game emulators globally,"Apple updated its App Store rules Friday to allow emulators for retro console games globally with an option for downloading titles. However, the company warned that the developers are responsible for making sure that they follow copyright rules.Android users can already access a ton of emulators to play old classics on their devices. Apple's update will probably encourage some of those developers to bring their emulators to the App Store.The company stated that these emulator apps must use an in-app purchase mechanism to offer digital items. With Apple having to tweak App Store rules because of regulations, these kinds of games would provide another revenue stream for the company.In January, when Apple released the first set of rules in compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules, the company also announced that it would allow streaming game stores globally. Plus, it updated App Store rules at that time to support in-app purchases for mini-games and AI chatbots.Apple also updated the clause on Friday for offering plug-ins to cover HTLM5-based mini-apps — possibly to include services offered by super apps like WeChat.""Apps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini-games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games,"" the clause said. Last month, when the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple, suppression of super apps was one of the five points in the lawsuit about the company's monopolistic practices.Another major upgrade to the rules will allow music streaming services — like Spotify — to display information about subscriptions and other digital buys along with including links to drive users to their website to complete the purchase.Last month, Spotify submitted an update in the App Store to show pricing information to EU-based users.The music streaming platform said that Apple still hasn't approved its submission. Spotify said that it is still reviewing Apple's updated rules.""Following the law is not optional, but Apple continues to defy that decision. Effective April 6th, the Commission can start noncompliance proceedings and impose daily fines. It’s time for decisive action to once and for all give consumers real choice,"" Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran told TechCrunch in a statement.The story has been updated with Spotify's statement.

2024-04-08 13:17:00+00:00,Will Meta Platforms Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030? 1 Key Financial Measure Says Yes.,"In 1984, the three largest U.S. companies were Exxon, General Motors, and Mobil. Today, the combined ExxonMobil ranks 14th on the market cap list, while General Motors has slipped all the way to No. 183.The lesson: It's hard to remain the darling of Wall Street. Companies once considered juggernauts can lose their way or simply be supplanted by fast-growing newcomers. There are, after all, always upstarts looking to climb the ranks, often powered by innovative products and guided by visionary leaders. With that in mind, let's compare two companies -- one rising, the other perhaps slipping -- and see if Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could surpass Apple's market cap by 2030.As of this writing, Apple has a market cap of $2.6 trillion, making it America's second-largest company, behind only Microsoft. Meta Platforms' market cap is roughly half that -- $1.3 trillion.So, at first blush, it appears unlikely that Meta will surpass Apple anytime soon. However, if you dig deeper, there are signs that a shift is underway.Over the long run, free cash flow per share is one of the most important financial metrics for any company. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said it was his ""ultimate financial measure.""The reason is that free cash flow per share represents how much shareholder value a company creates. With ample cash flow, managers can, directly or indirectly, return value to shareholders in several ways:Paying dividendsMaking acquisitionsReducing debtBuying back sharesAs a result, free cash flow per share and stock prices are highly correlated, particularly over the long term.So, how do Meta and Apple compare by that metric? Here are two charts showing their free cash flow per share and stock price over the last 10 years.In a nutshell, Apple's stock has been overperforming -- that is, running ahead of its free cash flow per share growth. Meanwhile, Meta has been underperforming -- lagging its free cash flow per share growth.What's more, if you directly compare their rates of growth, Meta has grown its free cash flow per share by more than 1,200% over the last 10 years, while Apple has only grown it by 252%. What this all means is that Apple's stock appears overvalued when compared to Meta's on this basis, and that, over time, Meta's stock price should increase to overlap with its free cash flow. Meanwhile, Apple's stock should, over time, fall to overlap with its free cash flow.There are a few caveats to this theory. Obviously, Apple's free cash flow per share can increase. New services and products could generate more revenue, or the company could cut costs to increase cash flow. Similarly, Meta's free cash flow could decrease if revenue growth slows or costs rise.Yet, if the trends hold, it's clear: Meta has a chance of surpassing Apple's market cap in another 10 years -- if not sooner. Consider this: Over the last 12 months alone, Meta's market cap has risen by more than 140%, from $532 billion to $1.3 trillion. Apple's is virtually unchanged.In other words, the shift is already underway. And with free cash flow per share playing its role behind the scenes, it may not be that long before Meta surpasses Apple.Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-08 12:34:51+00:00,TSMC gets $6.6 billion in chipmaking cash from Biden while pledging to build a third Arizona plant,"The Biden administration said Monday it plans to send up to $6.6 billion in federal grants to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) as the chipmaking giant promises a $25 billion Arizona expansion that will bring a third TSMC fabrication plant to that state.The deal, the second major US chipmaking grant announcement of the last three weeks, is part of President Joe Biden's effort to restart advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the US.In March Biden said the US would provide up to $8.5 billion in grants in the years ahead to Intel (INTC) to support a range of new projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon.The money for both companies is coming from 2022's CHIPs and Science law, a signature accomplishment of Biden's current term.TSMC will use the grants to fund the continued construction of two manufacturing plants already being built in the Phoenix area. The company also announced Monday it would build a third facility there in the years ahead.The goal is for all three plants to be online and producing TSMC's most advanced chips by the end of the decade. Some of the plants even hope to use a forthcoming 2-nanometer fabrication process and make even more advanced chips than are currently available.""These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technology that we need to underpin our economy,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters ahead of the announcement.The $6.6 billion in grants to be doled out in the years ahead include an allotment of $50 million for workforce development as well as additional authorization for up to $5 billion in government loans. That inflow comes in addition to manufacturing tax credits in the 2022 law that could be worth additional billions.The government money will pair with TSMC's plans to invest over $65 billion in its Arizona operations. It had previously announced $40 billion and said today it would add an additional $25 billion largely to fund construction of the third fabrication facility.Monday's news underlines the central role that Arizona is playing in the effort to bring back semiconductor manufacturing to the US.President Biden has made multiple semiconductor-themed trips to the state in recent years including a stop last month to announce the grants for Intel, which is also building in the state.""It’s an exciting day for Arizona, where we are leading the way in bringing the most advanced microchip manufacturing back to America,"" Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a negotiator of the 2022 law, told Yahoo Finance.Monday's announcement is the fifth manufacturing award from the law.In addition to TSMC and Intel, three smaller manufacturing awards had been previously announced. There was roughly $35 million for BAE Systems (BAESY), $162 million for Microchip Technology, and $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries (GFS) largely to fund the manufacturing of less advanced but still crucial chips.The 20-month-old law allows the White House to spend a total of about $50 billion — $39 billion specifically earmarked for manufacturing — to try and help reignite the sector in the years ahead.Arizona's path to semiconductor centrality began in May 2020 when TSMC announced new plans for the state.It's an effort that has also been marked by struggles to ensure that enough Americans will be trained for the coming positions; TSMC recently announced a delay in its US plant's full-scale launch from 2024 to 2025 and cited worker shortages as a reason, bringing in Taiwanese workers to help keep up.""I do expect that immigration and bringing in expertise from Taiwan both on the facilities side and the construction side will continue to be really important,"" a senior Biden administration official said ahead of the announcement. The official added that government and TSMC workforce development efforts will nevertheless mean ""the overwhelming effects of this investment is going to be to create thousands and thousands of American jobs.""TSMC has also said that they expect some of the worker challenges to lessen in each subsequent project with chairman Mark Liu saying in February of the first two projects, ""Even though we encountered challenges in Arizona for our first fab construction ... we believe the construction of our second fab will continue to be much smoother.""Biden officials call TSMC's overall project the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in US history. It is expected to create at least 6,000 direct permanent jobs in addition to 20,000 temporary construction jobs.The project is also expected to lead to ""tens of thousands"" of additional jobs as other companies work to supply the new massive facilities.The increased investment is due to an ever-rising demand from US companies for chips, specifically ones made inside the United States, says Lael Brainard, the director of Biden's National Economic Council.She notes that top officials like Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang attended a 2022 groundbreaking for TSMC's second facility in Arizona. Both Apple and Nvidia currently rely almost exclusively on chips from the company that are manufactured in Taiwan.In a statement Monday, Liu said the government's funding allowed for this increased investment, adding ""our U.S. operations allow us to better support our U.S. customers, which include several of the world’s leading technology companies.""Monday's announcement is part of the Biden administration's ambitious overall goal of having the US produce 20% of the world's most advanced semiconductors by the end of the decade.Secretary Raimondo oversees a team implementing the law and often notes the high challenge ahead with America currently producing 0% of these advanced chips (and only 10% of chips overall).This post has been updated with additional context.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tsmc-gets-66-billion-in-chipmaking-cash-from-biden-while-pledging-to-build-a-third-arizona-plant-090026550.html

It is the last such facility operated by the firm after it forfeited control of an iPhone plant in China last year to rival Luxshare in a $290 million deal.Tata and Pegatron did not respond to emailed requests for comments. Apple declined to comment. The sources did not share financial details of the ongoing negotiations.Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. For India's Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans.Tata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the neighbouring southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year, and is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where Pegatron is likely to emerge as its joint venture partner.Pegatron has for months also been building another iPhone factory at its Chennai campus, and the Tata deal talks include taking over that facility as well, the first source said.The talks between Tata and Pegatron for the factory are expected to close in six months and will see all of the Pegatron India employees move to the joint venture entity, the first source added.Apple's iPhone contract manufacturers in India currently include Tata, Pegatron and Foxconn. Tata is key to Apple's growing ambitions in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14% last year.The reasons for Pegatron's gradual withdrawal from its Apple business, including in India, were not known. Last year, Pegatron said the China plant deal was done to raise capital to ""optimise its business"".(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/exclusive-pegatron-talks-tata-sell-111227187.html

2024-04-08 08:35:00+00:00,Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $369 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock,"There's no denying Warren Buffett's remarkable track record. As the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has done an amazing job compounding capital at high rates over multiple decades. This is why the average investor closely watches what the Oracle of Omaha owns.Berkshire's massive $369 billion portfolio has dozens of stocks. But Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which represents 41.4% of the overall portfolio, stands out as the single largest holding. The FAANG stock has soared 542% since the start of 2016 (as of April 2), which is around the time Buffett first started buying the business.Before investors contemplate whether it's a good idea to scoop up shares today, it's important to understand the factors that first drew Buffett to Apple.Even in early 2016, Apple had one of the world's strongest brands, boosted by its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products. This gave the company pricing power. Consumers want to continue paying up for new devices.Buffett appreciates businesses that can consistently ask their customers to pay more without hurting demand. Another top Berkshire holding is Coca-Cola, which certainly fits this category.Apple is a financial powerhouse. In fiscal 2015, the business posted an operating margin of 30%. And it generated $70 billion of free cash flow (FCF) that year.This type of profitability continues today. Apple produced $100 billion of FCF in fiscal 2023. Management used this windfall to pay $15 billion in dividends and to repurchase $83 billion worth of outstanding stock.In addition to strong financial performance, valuation is another top factor that Buffett looks at. During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6. Given some of the sky-high valuations in the market today, this was an absolute steal for such a dominant company. Buffett took full advantage of the buying opportunity.While Apple has obviously worked out as a tremendous investment for Berkshire and Buffett, investors shouldn't just automatically buy the stock right now. I think it's best to view the current situation with a fresh perspective.If investors can agree on one thing today, it's that Apple is no longer the screaming bargain that it was about eight years ago when Buffett first bought shares. In my opinion, this is an expensive stock right now, which makes sense given its impressive performance over the years.Apple shares trade at a current P/E ratio of 26.3. To be fair, this has come down from the 32.3 it was less than four months ago. But it's still pricey.That's because Apple certainly doesn't have the same growth potential that it did several years ago. This is a far more mature enterprise today.In fact, the business saw its sales decline slightly in fiscal 2023. And over the next three years, Wall Street analysts expect revenue and earnings per share to rise at annualized clips of 4.4% and 8.3%, respectively. Paying such a high valuation multiple doesn't seem like a smart move considering these weak forecasts.We can't read his mind. However, I suspect Buffett still owns the stock because he doesn't want to trigger a taxable event. Or maybe he simply wouldn't know what to do with all the cash, a problem that Berkshire has already been dealing with.Apple has been a huge winner historically. But based on where things stand today, it's best to pass on the stock.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-07 14:30:00+00:00,What Can Apple's Success Teach Investors About Peloton's Struggles?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) couldn't be further apart at opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to rewarding their shareholders. The iPhone maker has seen shares soar 185% in the past four years, a time when the fitness company's stock has tanked 86%.But despite their vastly different performances, investors can look at both of these businesses to gain insights for portfolio decisions. There is a lot that Apple's success can teach us about Peloton's struggles that might affect how you view the latter's stock.At a high level, it's not too difficult to figure out how Apple and Peloton are the same. Both businesses sell well-designed and easy-to-use consumer hardware.In Apple's case, it offers the highly successful iPhone, which might turn out to be the single greatest product introduction ever. It also sells MacBooks, iPads, AirPods, and the Apple Watch, for example. These products raked in $96 billion of revenue in the latest fiscal quarter.Peloton is known for its flagship Bike, but it also sells an upgraded Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row. These items aren't cheap -- they can cost thousands of dollars. During the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, the company generated $319 million from sales of these exercise products.Besides their hardware, Apple and Peloton both develop their own proprietary software that helps differentiate that hardware.The difference in the success of these two companies couldn't be more drastic. Apple is consistently profitable, generates huge amounts of cash, pays dividends, repurchases shares, and has a pristine balance sheet. This financial prowess is certainly a reason its shares are owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.Meanwhile, Peloton is posting revenue declines, and it remains far from profitability, reporting a net loss of $195 million just in the latest quarter. And as of Dec. 31, it carried $1.7 billion of debt, more than its current market cap.Apple is in an advantageous position because it sells products and services that have global appeal -- basically the entire world's population can be viewed as the company's addressable market. Peloton's expensive fitness products likely only draw interest from a small subset of people who are very committed to their health.And Apple's products are the kinds of things people can't function in their daily lives without, while Peloton's exercise equipment and fitness app require lots of effort from customers. The latter company is constantly betting on its users to stick to their workout regimens, which might be a losing proposition.Viewed next to Apple, Peloton's issues are glaring. I think there are two key takeaways for investors when comparing these two companies. They both center on the fact that Peloton's struggles, namely falling demand and a lack of profits, might be permanent.Even though Apple might see weak iPhone demand, it's still generating sizable earnings and cash. When Peloton was experiencing incredible demand during the pandemic, it still wasn't profitable on an annual basis; it might never reach consistent positive net income.I'm not even sure that Peloton's products aren't still just a fad, like other fitness products in the past. There are an unlimited number of ways people can work out, calling into question the durability of what the company offers. Apple has proved that it's not going anywhere, as a key part of our daily lives, while Peloton might never get back to reporting solid growth in sales and users.Risk-seeking investors looking to buy Peloton stock in the hope that management can orchestrate a successful turnaround should think twice. The odds of achieving strong returns aren't stacked in their favor.Before you buy stock in Peloton Interactive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Peloton Interactive wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-07 11:45:00+00:00,"Meet the Best-Performing ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Over the Last Month (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)","The ""Magnificent Seven"" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven large, tech-focused companies. Due to a combination of their size, underlying fundamentals, and growth, these companies led the market rally in 2023. They have also contributed the bulk of the S&P 500's gains in 2024.However, something has changed over the last month. One of the three Magnificent Seven stocks that had been down year to date is suddenly up -- a lot -- over the last month.Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has suddenly become the hottest Magnificent Seven stock and why it remains a great value even though it is hovering around a 52-week high.It has been a wild ride for Alphabet stock in 2024. In late January, it was around the same price it is today -- above $150 a share. But in early March, it fell to the low $130 per-share range due to investor pessimism regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- specifically, Google Gemini AI and its inaccuracies.But then, in mid-March, news surfaced that Alphabet was in talks with Apple to license Gemini AI in iPhones, putting a much-needed stamp of approval on Alphabet's AI endeavors. The stock rose as much as 7.7% on March 18, which contributed to its over 12% gain in the past month.Partnering with Apple would be a huge deal for Alphabet. Despite owning various differentiated businesses, like Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android, Alphabet still depends on ads for the vast majority of its revenue. The more it can diversify its business away from ads, the wider its moat and the more levers it can pull to unlock growth.At least in the short term, Alphabet stock has moved in and out of favor with Wall Street based on its perceived AI aptitude and potential. In reality, this is a company that has been monetizing AI for some time and has a massive research and development budget and cash to invest in innovation.With so many growth narratives flooding the market, it can be easy to get caught up in implied-growth trajectories and overlook the companies that have already accomplished so much and are earning a ton of profit. In other words, outweighing the unknown and discounting proven winners.Alphabet is a proven winner, but there are question marks surrounding how it will stay a winner in the midst of so much competition.Google Search and YouTube rely on complex AI-driven algorithms. But platforms like TikTok and Meta Platforms' Instagram Reels have been cited as alternative search engines to Google by younger generations like Gen Z.Meanwhile, Google Cloud is third behind Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud-infrastructure market share.Android is still the dominant operating system globally, but iOS is bigger in core areas like the U.S., and Apple has more control over its hardware and software integration than Alphabet.The glass-half-empty outlook on Alphabet is that it is a market leader across many different industries but that all of its industries are ripe for disruption.It has been the leader in search for decades, but can it maintain pole position in the face of mounting competition from short-video platforms or new competition remains to be seen?Consumers have more entertainment options than ever, so will YouTube lose market share to other streaming sites?Will Google Cloud be able to take market share against its larger peers?These are all valid questions.When you like a company, it's always good to consider the counterargument. Charlie Munger used to talk about the inversion process as a way to expand a line of thinking. Before buying a stock, we usually think about the reasons why the company is a good investment. But inversion would involve thinking about all the reasons why folks would want to sell the stock, why it could go lower, underperform the market, etc.There's usually a halfway decent counterargument to even the best stocks. But sometimes, even bad counterarguments can become dominant market sentiment if the market is pessimistic on a stock as it had been on Alphabet relative to the rest of the Magnificent Seven.Alphabet has an established, cash-cow business model and plenty of ways to monetize AI. It is no stranger to competition, as there are always other companies that want a slice of a high-margin industry.In Alphabet's favor is its inexpensive valuation. It has a mere 26.7 price-to-earnings ratio, slightly above Apple's 26.3 for the second-lowest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. It also has a 28.8 price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio, also second-lowest behind Apple in the Magnificent Seven.Alphabet may not be the most exciting growth stock out there right now. But what it does have is a profitable business and room to take risks and unlock growth. Alphabet's deep pockets and track record of innovation are reason enough for the stock to not trade at a discount to the S&P 500 (like it does today).Alphabet stock should have never fallen as much as it did. And even now, it looks like a reasonable long-term buy for patient investors.Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023, and so far this year, its shares are up around 80%.But analysts don't expect this sizzling momentum to continue. The consensus price target for Nvidia is barely above its current share price. Here are three ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks Wall Street thinks will soar more than Nvidia over the next 12 months.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a laggard in 2024. It even lost the spot as the biggest company in the world, based on market cap, to Microsoft. However, analysts are more bullish about Apple than any other Magnificent Seven stock right now.The average 12-month price target for Apple reflects an upside potential of over 9%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April, 32 rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The others recommend holding the stock.It might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26.Analysts, though, could be anticipating a catalyst with Apple's June developer conference. The company is widely expected to unveil its generative AI strategy at the event.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't delivered Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns. However, the e-commerce and cloud services leader nonetheless pleased investors with a gain of 80% last year and a 20% jump so far this year.Wall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy.Generative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps.Amazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video.Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) jumped 58% in 2023. The stock is up over 10% year to date in 2024. Like Apple and Amazon, Alphabet still has more room to run in Wall Street's view.The average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy.Alphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business.You can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too.Nvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds.Wall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-06 18:28:25+00:00,"Apple's road ahead: New products, diversifying revenue streams will be key to its stock, analysts say","Slowing growth. Rising competition. Widening scrutiny.Apple is falling flat in China and with investors, as the shine comes off of the once darling stock. Shares of the tech giant have declined 8.5% this year, wiping more than $300 billion from its market capitalization, and underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.However, not all is lost. The stock correction is making Apple's valuation more attractive, analysts say, and it's not out of the question that the company wows the world again with new offerings.Currently, Apple's stock has fallen 14% from its December peak of $198.11, compared to the S&P 500’s 10% gain and the Nasdaq 100’s nearly 9% climb during the same time.A number of factors have unnerved investors, including sluggish iPhone demand, intensifying Chinese competition, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance Live.The growing list of obstacles has prompted more than a few of Martin’s peers to become more bearish on the stock in the short-term. Goldman Sachs removed Apple from its Conviction List last month, while Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic were among firms that have downgraded the stock in 2024.Earlier this week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah cut his price target on Apple to $170 from $185, and lowered his earnings estimates, writing in a client note that lackluster demand, ""softer fundamentals,"" and competition from Huawei and Xiaomi are having a ""material impact.""""iPhone unit shipments are simply too soft,"" Baruah wrote. ""We currently believe that both Street iPhone units and revenue [estimates] could be 20% too high, and that Wall Street’s overall revenue and EPS [estimates] could be 10% too high.""Baruah expects Apple's annual revenue and earnings to decline in 2024 — which has not happened since 2016.And Apple's woes in China aren't going away. iPhone sales in the country dropped 24% during the first six weeks of the year, with Apple's market share falling below 16%, according to a Counterpoint Research report. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo holds the largest domestic market share with 17.6%, while Huawei and Honor Device accounted for 16.5% and 16.3%, respectively.TECHnalysis Research's Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance Live that the road ahead for Apple will be challenging, as the region contributed nearly one-fifth of the tech giant’s overall revenue in its most recent quarter.""I think the next couple of quarters is going to be tough,"" O’Donnell said. ""I'm hoping that Apple will pull a rabbit out of its hat. It's done so in the past, and I'm not convinced it can't do that now.""Despite waning excitement on Wall Street, now may be the time to bet on Apple. The recent selloff has put its shares at a discount, Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live, giving it a more attractive risk-reward set up.""Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time, because it’s got a great balance sheet, a highly repeatable business model, good margins, and they're buying back quite a bit of stock,"" Johnson explained.Beyond its solid balance sheet, several analysts remain confident in the company's ability to regain momentum. The Vision Pro headset and anticipated AI initiatives are largely viewed as future revenue growth drivers, along with additional sources of revenue, including a potential advertising push.""Maybe demand is slower in China, but it has really wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem, so they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth,"" Martin said. ""Apple needs to figure out a way to add more services and software so it can get more subscription revenue and up its revenue per device.""Martin is among a shortened list of analysts who have maintained a buy rating on Apple. At the start of the second quarter, just over half the analysts covering Apple rated the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data.

2024-04-06 11:07:00+00:00,Apple Winds Down Spending in 1 Key Area Where Meta Has Been Surprisingly Transparent,"The release of the hotly anticipated Vision Pro from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- the headset that does virtual reality (VR) things, but which Apple calls a ""spatial computing"" device -- is not providing the lift some investors had hoped for. Instead, Apple has found itself embroiled in some of the same regulatory issues as its megatech peers. After hitting it with a $2 billion fine, the European Commission is further investigating the iPhone company for other anticompetitive practices.These regulatory issues, paired with slowing revenue growth, have caused the stock to underperform market indexes over the last 12 months.Amid these challenges, Apple has begun cutting back secretive expenses that one big tech peer, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), has been surprisingly transparent about: research and development (R&D).According to widely reported information from a series of leaked internal notifications, Apple is apparently scrapping two big R&D projects that have been the source of all sorts of Apple product fan excitement (or speculation) for years. Project Titan, the code name for an Apple self-driving electric car, or at least some sort of underlying technology, is being wound down. Likewise, longtime work on microLED technology for use in products like the Apple Watch is also being scrapped.No word on if anything will happen to Apple's 5G modem project for mobile devices. However, given Apple just signed new multiyear 5G chip supply agreements with both Broadcom and Qualcomm last year, I wouldn't be surprised to hear this project is being sunsetted as well.Of course, investors who peel back Apple's spending habits probably could have guessed sweeping changes were coming. After a couple of decades of R&D increases since the iPhone was announced in 2007, a new era of financial efficiency appears to be beginning for Apple. R&D expenses actually declined in the last year. Meanwhile, Meta has also been enjoying the fruit of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's work on becoming a more efficient business -- although R&D is overall still on the rise.While investors have to largely speculate on Apple's specific project spending, and how it might redeploy those expenses, Meta has been remarkably transparent. It changed its name from Facebook to its current corporate name back in 2021 to reflect that chunky line item for Reality Labs (RL), the VR headsets and related technology that Apple is now competing against with Vision Pro. The RL segment rang up a whopping operating loss (R&D expense included) of $16.1 billion in 2023. Much of the rest of Meta's R&D spending spree is no doubt related to its data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) as it spends heavily on Nvidia hardware and other related projects.It seems Apple is ready to pivot as well, and pare back some spending in favor of driving higher profit margins. Perhaps we'll get some clearer direction on future project developments from CEO Tim Cook and company, too.Before taking all of this as some sort of signal that Apple's dominance is waning, I have one more chart for you: return on invested capital (ROIC), which measures the profit gained from past investments made.Apple's ROIC has gone through the roof in recent years as its mobile product lineup matures.Based on this track record of successful innovation and new product commercialization, investors should hope Apple redeploys R&D spending from its scrapped car and mobile display experiments to something new. ROIC of over 50% is mind-bogglingly good. Imagine if you, an individual investor, invested $1, and received $0.50 from that investment every year going forward. That's the kind of return Apple is getting from its development efforts right now.Granted, like all things in investing, past results are not indicative of future performance. Nevertheless, with a large global user base of its products, Apple has ample room to bring more products and services (say, an AI assistant, one better than Siri) to market and make more money.In the meantime, as 2024 rolls on and as more news surfaces about Apple cutting costs, investors' best hope for the stock making a rally may be in good old-fashioned earnings growth -- exactly the secret to Meta's resurgence the last couple of years.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion.Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are in the club now. All of them are artificial intelligence (AI) leaders. Here's the AI stock I think will be the next to join the $1 trillion club.I won't try to build up the suspense. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is the AI stock I predict will be the next in line behind Meta, Amazon, and others with market caps of $1 trillion or more. However, I'm not arguing that Broadcom will be the next to achieve that milestone; it will just be the next AI stock to do so.Berkshire Hathaway will probably top $1 trillion before Broadcom. Warren Buffett's conglomerate already has a market cap of over $900 million. I won't be surprised if Eli Lilly also reaches the threshold ahead of Broadcom thanks to soaring sales of its weight-loss drug Zepbound and type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro.However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task.Two other AI stocks are also contenders: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). I think Broadcom will beat both to a $1 trillion market cap.Tesla has a longer way to go than Broadcom does. The electric vehicle (EV) maker's market cap hovers around $520 million right now. Tesla also faces some major challenges.Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled.I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications.However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors.Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending.Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no.My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in. I expect the company could take longer to reach a market cap of $1 trillion than many investors would like.Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-05 21:56:35+00:00,Apple to let music streaming apps in Europe link to own websites for purchases,"By Granth Vanaik(Reuters) - Apple announced measures on Friday to make it easier for music streaming apps on its App Store in the European Economic Area to inform users of other ways to purchase digital services, as it looks to comply with a European Union mandate.The announcement comes weeks after the iPhone maker was fined 1.84 billion euros ($1.99 billion) by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.The European Commission had said in March that Apple's restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions and that it should stop such conduct.Following a 2019 complaint by Swedish streaming service Spotify, the Commission charged Apple last year with preventing the Swedish company and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store.Apple on Friday said it would permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for sending them a link to the developer's website to purchase digital music content or services, and to inform them about where and how to purchase items as well as the price.The company said that the announcement provides ""even more"" flexibility to music streaming service apps, including Spotify, which has 56% share of the European market.Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple, however, said the Commission's decision does not address its ability to charge a commission for all the tools, technologies and ongoing services it provides.($1 = 0.9230 euros)(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-let-music-streaming-apps-215635092.html
2024-04-05 21:48:22+00:00,Apple asks US appeals court to reverse Apple Watch import ban,"By Blake Brittain(Reuters) - Apple urged a U.S. appeals court on Friday to overturn a U.S. trade tribunal's decision to ban imports of some Apple Watches in a patent dispute with medical-monitoring technology company Masimo.Apple told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the U.S. International Trade Commission's decision was based on a ""series of substantively defective patent rulings,"" and that Masimo failed to show it had invested in making competing U.S. products that would justify the order.Representatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing.Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry to its Series 6 Apple Watches in 2020.Masimo convinced the ITC on Dec. 26 to block imports of Apple's latest-edition Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after finding that their technology for reading blood-oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents.Apple temporarily resumed sales of the watches the next day after persuading the Federal Circuit to pause the ban. The appeals court reinstated the ban in January, leading Apple to remove pulse oximetry capabilities from watches sold during the appeal, which Apple has said could last at least a year.U.S. Customs and Border Protection separately determined in January that redesigned versions of the watches did not violate Masimo's rights and would not be not subject to the ban. Masimo said in a court filing that the watches ""definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.""Apple told the Federal Circuit on Friday that the ban could not stand because a Masimo wearable covered by the patents was ""purely hypothetical"" when it filed its ITC complaint in 2021.The tech giant also argued that Masimo's patents were invalid and that its watches did not infringe them.(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Josie Kao)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-asks-us-appeals-court-214822462.html

Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now ""the topic du jour.""Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with ""stars attached"" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a ""tried and true"" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to ""build out incredible franchises"" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: YouTube superstar MrBeast is going to Amazon. The content creator recently striking a deal with Amazon MGM Studios for his first traditional streaming series. For more on what this means for the streaming landscape and maybe if this is a trend to come, we're bringing in Paul Pastor. He's Co-founder and Chief Business Officer of Quickplay.And Paul, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, just to set the stage here. Talk to us about what Quickplay does and sort of your view on the streaming industry from where you sit.PAUL PASTOR: Certainly, well, thank you so much for having me today. So Quickplay is an OTT or over-the-top television service provider. We support what we call tier one operators sports, sports holders, and media groups.So what is a tier one operator means? It means somebody who has a very complex ecosystem that's maybe managing legacy systems and legacy business models, as well as current and future ones with streaming. They happen to have really-- they want control of their roadmap, and they want to make sure that they can respond to the various needs of their consumers.And importantly, they have very big executives who often come in with a request or demand that are looking for new features, new innovations that lead the market. And they're looking for platforms like ourselves to help them drive that change in their organization.In terms of the industry, it's an unbelievable time to be involved in the industry. We're seeing a tremendous amount of change. I started in the industry when cable was being developed.And then we had digital terrestrial television. That was in the process of transforming the industry. And now, most of the business models that I set up maybe 20 years ago have now folded as now streaming becomes the topic Du Jour.But there's a tremendous number of trends in the industry at this moment that I'm sure you're seeing. First and foremost, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of focus on cost at this moment where streamers are rationalizing their content investment, their marketing investment, and importantly, their technology investment.Second, you've seen a tremendous amount of consolidation in industry where people are looking to aggregate in order to offer a better value proposition to consumers. And then fundamentally, there is the management and focus on profitability as they sunset many of their older businesses that were huge profit drivers and transform these into their new profit drivers.JOSH LIPTON: And, Paul, this news, you know, of MrBeast and this deal with Prime Video, is that a trend we're seeing Paul, these big names, these big influencers cutting these kind of high profile content deals?PAUL PASTOR: Absolutely. Listen, this is a tried and true model. We always in Hollywood like to greenlight projects that have big stars attached because it reduces the risk. There's built in equity with the consumer in terms of how to follow these stars.So this is a very tried and true model. What Amazon has done and stealing the talent from YouTube or borrowing or leveraging the brand from YouTube into their program with a huge prize. They made a huge splash.But let's not forget that there's other businesses that are out there that are fundamentally pursuing the very same thing, which is how to democratize content through YouTube like a pocket watch or a Moonbug that focus on the kids area, but then build out these incredible franchises that they then take to more traditional streaming or traditional media platforms.Another one you sell was Morphy. For example, that was announced this year coming from YouTube from Moonbug that will now be available on Disney and Disney Plus. So this is most certainly a model that Hollywood is familiar with.It presents a great opportunity, obviously, for influencers and those who build their brands in these more democratized platforms to be able to extend that IP, to extend their talents, and really grow what is basically a production company and franchise business through these other various platforms.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/amazon-mgm-partners-youtuber-mrbeast-213526676.html

2024-04-05 20:16:38+00:00,Forget the Dow; Buy This Magnificent ETF Instead,"If you're one of those investors drawn to index funds, good for you! Index funds have a lot going for them:A tendency toward extremely low fees.Nearly instant ownership of a host of stocks in the index being tracked.A solid performance that beats most actively managed stock funds.Indeed, index funds can be all you need to generate your retirement savings.There's a catch, though: Which index you're tracking matters a lot. For instance, if you think it's good to go with an index fund tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you might want to think again. Here's a look at why, and a recommendation of an alternative (more impressive) index fund to consider.The S&P 500 index is one of the leading indexes in America, and it monitors about 500 stocks. Together, they represent about 80% of the total value of the U.S. stock market. The Dow is just as well known (if not more so), but it tracks the performance of only 30 stocks. These include Amazon, Apple, IBM, Coca-Cola, and Walmart -- all of which are also in the S&P 500.One of the most problematic things about the Dow index is that it's price-weighted, which means that its published value is an average of all its components' stock prices. So its higher-priced components, such as Microsoft (recent stock price: $425) will influence the index much more than its lower-priced components, such as Intel (recent price: $42). And that's only because of their stock prices, not because of their market dominance, growth prospects, cash generation, or any other metric.A stock's price alone is not very meaningful -- a $10 stock might be very overvalued and ready to fall, while a $500 stock could be on its way to tripling within a few years.Alternatively, the S&P 500, and many other indexes, are weighted by market capitalization, so that the bigger companies exert more influence on the index's value. That, too, can be problematic to some degree, which is why there are some indexes that are equal-weighted, giving every component equal influence, such as the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index.Long-term investors interested in growth stocks and boosting their portfolio's performance should consider the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG), a market-cap-weighted index fund with an impressive track record and solid potential to keep performing well. It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF), meaning it trades like a stock, but it's also a mutual fund (VIGAX) for those trading within the Vanguard system.Let's start with its track record, just to get your attention. The table below shows how the Vanguard Growth ETF has performed over time (based on total returns), comparing it to a simple S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF: Vanguard Growth ETFSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust1 year38.8%29.6%3 years10.9%11.3%5 years17.9%15%10 years15.1%12.9%15 years17.3%15.6%Source: Morningstar.com.Impressive, right? Keep a few things in mind, though. For starters, that big, fat one-year return of nearly 39% isn't to be expected very often, if at all. Also, you'll see that over the past three years, the Vanguard Growth ETF underperformed the S&P 500. And its future performance is in no way guaranteed to follow past performance.The Vanguard Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, which represents the growth style of the top 85% of U.S. equity market capitalization.The ETF has an expense ratio (an annual fee) of 0.04%, which is quite low, costing $4 per $10,000 invested. Since it holds many different stocks, plenty of which pay dividends, it passes those dividends on to shareholders. The ETF's dividend yield is about 0.5%. The strong stock performance of late has depressed the dividend yield.The Vanguard Growth ETF's portfolio features 208 stocks, with a median market value near $715 billion. So it's focused on large-cap companies -- and relatively fast-growing ones.Since it's weighted by market cap and includes many of the biggest tech stocks -- such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia -- the overall portfolio is very weighted toward tech stocks. It had 56% of its holdings in the technology sector (and all of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, too). Here are the ETF's top 10 holdings at the end of February:Microsoft: 12.84% of the fundApple: 11.15%Nvidia: 7.75%Amazon: 6.87%Meta Platforms: 4.54%Alphabet (Class A): 3.42%Alphabet (Class C): 2.84%Eli Lilly: 2.69%Tesla: 2.28%Visa: 1.81%So consider the Vanguard Growth ETF if you would like to quickly gain exposure to 208 relatively fast-growing stocks. If it doesn't appeal to you, know that there are many other solid ETFs out there, including plenty of fast-growing ones.Before you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-05 20:14:44+00:00,Apple Supplier Reports Revenue Dip But Expects Growth Ahead As The AI Revolution Created Room For Contributors,"Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF)-owned Foxconn that manufactures iPhones that are the apple of the eye of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its first quarter results. With the first quarter being a typically quiet period, it comes as no surprise that Foxconn posted a revenue dup. However, Foxconn is expecting revenue growth in the second quarter despite it still being an off-peak season.First quarter highlightsFor the first quarter, Foxconn posted a 9.6% drop in revenue, however, Apple supplier noted that its cloud and networking segment reported significant revenue growth. But total revenue amounted to 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars which equates to about $41.2 billion and it was also 28.58% lower compared to the previous, fourth, quarter. But, fourth quarter is usually when suppliers race to enable tech giants like Apple to satisfy the holiday demand. But, according to Counterpoint Research, overall shipments if smartphones declined 3.2% during 2023.The AI hype is in the airAlthough Foxconn is behind AI chipmaking leader, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), it still has gained momentum of late.View more earnings on HNHPFAs a reminder, Foxconn teamed up with Nvidia last year. Foxconn and Nvidia joined class to develop certain “AI factories” which are a new class of data centers that use Nvidia chips to power all kinds of applications ranging from large language models to training autonomous vehicles. Also, Foxconn will develop smart solution platforms that are based on technologies that Nvidia developed. By gaining access to Nvidia’s solutions, Foxconn will get to offer safe AI-powered EVs and make its mark in the new era. In simple words, Nvidia joined forces with Foxconn on its path to accelerate the AI Industrial Revolution. Considering that AI development requires more than chips, there is room for all kinds of industrial contributors as even the all-mighty Nvidia cannot do everything alone, which bodes well for Foxconn.Despite the traditional off-peak period and a recent earthquake, higher March revenue from consumer-electronics and cloud demand fueled Apple supplier to expect revenue growth in the second quarter. Also, Foxconn shares rose almost 21% year-to-date.Rebound hopes are based on AIAlthough the sales slump offers little hope for the rebound of the Apple star, the iPhone, , the growing demand for AI servers empowered Foxconn to expect a revenue rebound in the second quarter and be optimistic for the year ahead.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

2024-04-05 15:28:34+00:00,Foxconn posts 9.6% revenue decline in Q1,"Foxconn, the company best known for assembling Apple's (AAPL) iPhones, reported that its first quarter revenue fell 9.6% from a year ago. Foxconn, which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW, HNHPF), expects sales to grow in the current quarter.in the video above, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Seana Smith discuss the report.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie MikulichBRAD SMITH: Apple supplier Foxconn posted a 9.6% revenue dip in the first quarter, but remained confident that revenue will grow the second quarter. The company, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry in Taiwan, it cites that the early part of the year is traditionally a downtime for the smartphone suppliers post holiday season. One of the huge things I think as well is being able to check in on Apple shares and the demand profile that we know for a lot of what the companies have been navigating. We were talking about Samsung earlier. For Apple, they're seeing a move higher of about half a percent.But I think perhaps it's more focused on how Foxconn is going to deliver for them on the second half of this year, part of the year where they typically have a lot of their larger announcements, especially on the hardware, handset, smartphone, wearables devices as well typically.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. We closely track this just because of exactly like you're saying. What this means for Apple? What if this is offering any sort of insight into demand? I think one of the reasons why Apple is also rising with the broader market today is also because Apple shares, it's no secret, have been under a tremendous amount of pressure, have far been an underperformer when you compare it to some of those other Mag Seven names since the start of the year. When you're looking at year-to-date losses, it's in the red. You're still looking at a loss here over the last several days as well.So taking into account that some of that bad news or some of that worry had already been priced in actually over the last five days still up just about 1%, but year-to-date still in the red. Analysts getting a bit more bearish on Apple, at least in the short-term. You talk about the fact that we do see falling demand or saturated demand here in the US, and then taking a look at what's happening over in China, obviously, sluggish demand there, rising competition. And then also the fact that the lackluster in terms of excitement surrounding their new products, What is exactly going to take to get iPhone users who currently have an iPhone to upgrade?And there's lots of questions about whether or not this next cycle that we will likely get in the fall if that will be enough to kind of change some of that momentum. So many more analysts than we had seen over the last several months have been moving to the sideline on this name Apple. And I think we're seeing some of that lackluster demand reflected in Foxconn's results today.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And segment by segment here, specifically one of those segment, and we've been focused in on smartphones here declined year-over-year, it blamed actually the high base, so tough comps that they had seen last year when they were really being able to move through some of the orders that they saw come in and after one of the factories there did see some reopening. That was, of course, chronologically coming after the zero COVID policy, a zero tolerance for COVID policy and pandemic disruptions that the industry had seen as well.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/foxconn-posts-9-6-revenue-152834014.html
2024-04-05 14:46:06+00:00,Apple lets go of 600 workers in California,"Apple (AAPL) is cutting over 600 workers in California, signaling the tech giant's first major wave of layoffs amid broader consolidation across the tech industry. Speculation is mounting that these cuts may be linked to the conclusion of the company's electric vehicle (EV) project.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Madison Mills breaks down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithMADISON MILLS: Now we're going to move over to some company news because Apple cut over 600 jobs in California. That's according to a state filing and the filing did not specify what sector the cuts are in. But experts are speculating that it is related to the company abandoning their long running project to build an electric self-driving car.And Seana, what I think is particularly interesting about this, is that these are notices that are filed with the state of California. So we know right now that it's 600 jobs but it could be significantly more given that some employees could be in other places of the country of course.And we're anticipating that this is again related to project Titan, the cars project. But also the display project as well that they were working on, so curious to see how this number kind of develops long term and what the scope of it is.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And I think when we initially got this news that Apple was abandoning its EV car plans. A lot of the thought there was some of those workers were then going to be moved and used for their AI initiatives and their interest in research within that department. But the layoffs I think, for Apple also brings up the fact of a trend that we've seen since the start of the year.We have certainly seen a number of these larger tech companies announce layoffs actually. I mean, take a look at the tech sector, that sector accounted for the largest portion of job cuts of any of the major sectors here in Q1.So I think the question a lot of people are asking, when we talk about the resilience overall of the labor market is whether or not some of that trend that we saw in terms of trimming headcount in the first quarter specifically within the tech sector, whether or not we are going to see a further contraction within tech with an employee headcount? Or if we're going to start to see a shift?If it's leveled out just a bit, we were talking to one of LinkedIn's economists earlier in last hour. And he was talking about the fact that he does expect that to level off just a bit, that tech companies are hiring once again and hiring has increased just a bit or interest to hire has increased a little bit on their platform.But when you've got a big name like Apple, that is cutting jobs here. It's grabbing the attention, refocusing some of its focus here in terms of the AI initiatives. It's going to make investors think twice just about what some of those longer term goals are here for the company.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-lets-600-workers-california-144606884.html
2024-04-05 13:45:00+00:00,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks This Magnificent Seven Stock Is Going to $220. Is It a buy Around $169?,"One of the more magnificent of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the hearts of many investors is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). They keep their positions in the tech giant on hopes of further growth from its selection of appealing devices, and the company's ever-widening software ecosystem.More than a few analysts tracking the stock believe in the company's future too. One of them recently reiterated his view that the shares could appreciate by 30%. Even for Apple, however, that's a chunky growth rate. Is it realistically achievable?Following an update from Apple on the performance of its App Store, Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani felt compelled to publish a fresh research note on the company.The tech giant did well with its app marketplace. Total revenue from it rose by 13% in March with growth occurring in all categories, according to the analyst. Daryanani feels that gives the company a fine chance at exceeding its guidance for 11% growth in services revenue for its yet-to-be-reported second quarter of fiscal 2024.Furthermore, the prognosticator wrote in his note that ""the strength of the March print increases our confidence that Apple can maintain App Store growth in the double digits.""Daryanani's positive take on Apple is in some contrast to the more cautious analysts tracking the stock. Some are concerned that the once-mighty iPhone is losing a bit of its luster due to weakening demand and lower-priced competition. The device did see a 24% year-over-year tumble in sales in the crucial market of China in the first six weeks of this year, after all.As a longtime Apple bull and determined holder of the stock, I lean more toward Daryanani's argument. Hardware sales are critical and foundational, of course, but the company has made bigger strides with services. These grew by 11% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, against the essentially stagnant development of product sales. This should buoy the company's overall growth, and keep its investors sweet.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-05 13:35:54+00:00,Key analyst says latest Apple move would be a 'horror show',"Apple is reportedly exploring the development of personalized robots. The move comes just a few weeks after Apple shut down its electric car project. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said such a push into home robotics would be a ""horror show."" Just a few weeks after abandoning its electric car project, Apple  (AAPL) , according to a Bloomberg report, is exploring the field of personal robotics.Teams of engineers, according to the report, have been working on developing a small, personal robot that would follow people around their homes. The project is still in its early research phase.Related: Report: Apple's already eyeing its next big thingPeople familiar with the project told Bloomberg that the personal robotics push could be the ""next big thing"" for the company, though the report added that Apple has yet to commit to the project.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNBC Thursday that, if the project comes to fruition, it would serve as nothing but a distraction from the key area that Ives thinks Apple ought to be focusing on: artificial intelligence.""It would be a horror show if they actually spent money on robots,"" Ives said. ""They need to focus on AI.""Ives added that Apple CEO Tim Cook's ""legacy is going to be AI. If they went after robots, that would be a black-eye moment for Apple.""Ives, who has remained bullish on Apple despite recent stock pressure, is convinced that AI is the real next big thing for the iPhone makers.“We believe the 'Super Bowl moment for Apple' will be when Cook & Co. finally take the covers off the generative AI technology being worked on in the labs of Apple Park and introduce it to developers and consumers at WWDC in June followed by the exclusive AI features we expect to be included on iPhone 16,” Ives said in a February note.Ives said in a note Thursday that the AI revolution is in full swing. He expects tech stocks to rise another 15% for the year.Cook in February said that Apple sees “incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we're currently investing significantly in this area.” He added that Apple intends to finally go public with its efforts in generative AI later this year.Deepwater Management's Gene Munster, unlike Ives, said Thursday that it makes sense for Apple to have a small project to explore home automation.But he doesn't expect it to amount to much.""That said, I put the probability that we see a product in the next five years at slim to none,"" Munster wrote.

The filing did not name the project, but roles affected by the layoffs include ""machine shop"" managers, product design engineers and hardware engineers, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.In February, Apple announced internally that it was canceling its effort to build an electric car, dubbed Project Titan, according to Bloomberg.APPLE SCRAPPING ELECTRIC CAR PROJECT The company spent billions of dollars on the project, and the move surprised the nearly 2,000 employees who were working on it, Bloomberg also reported.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPThe outlet said that some of the workers would be redirected to focus on Apple's generative artificial intelligence division, while others will be laid off.Rumors have swirled for years that Apple was trying to build an autonomous electric taxi in an effort to take on electric vehicle giant Tesla. BIDEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TAKES AIM AT APPLE EVEN THOUGH CONSUMERS LOVE IT In 2017, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company was working on autonomous systems that could have applications in the self-driving car segment.That year, Apple obtained a permit from the state of California to test vehicles equipped with self-driving equipment on public roads.But ultimately, top executives decided in February of this year to scrap the project after it reached a ""make-or-break point,"" Bloomberg reported.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS      Apple did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment from FOX Business.Original article source: Apple laying off 614 California workers after scrapping electric car project",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-laying-off-614-california-130131579.html
2024-04-05 10:14:33+00:00,Apple axes 600 jobs after giving up on electric cars,"Apple is cutting more than 600 jobs after abandoning its decade-long efforts to build an electric car.The redundancies are the first at Apple since the pandemic and are happening at Silicon Valley offices believed to house parts of its electric car project.A team working on new screen technology is also being shut down. Apple revealed the lay-offs in state filings in California.It comes after Tim Cook cancelled the company’s efforts to develop a self-driving car, dubbed Project Titan, which reportedly had over 2,000 staff.The project was launched in secret in 2014 and has since gone through repeated restructurings and leadership changes as Apple grappled with how to enter the fiercely competitive automotive industry.At one point, Apple had planned to build a fully autonomous vehicle that could drive itself. The company operated a test fleet of self-driving cars on California’s roads.Last year, it had 67 Lexus SUVs registered with Californian officials that had been vetted to test its software.The decision to ditch the electric vehicle comes as global demand for battery-powered cars wanes.The cars remain more expensive than petrol equivalents at the budget end of the market, while high inflation has dampened demand for new cars overall.On Tuesday, Tesla’s shares fell by more than 5pc after it disappointed investors with a report that deliveries of its popular electric cars had fallen sharply.The job cuts at Apple include hundreds of roles in the Californian city of Santa Clara, according to state filings. Earlier this year, Apple also cut 121 jobs from an office in San Diego.Unlike other tech giants such as Google and Meta, Apple has largely avoided such public mass redundancies. While it has given up on its electric vehicle dream, Apple has shifted its efforts towards embedding more powerful artificial intelligence technology in its gadgets.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that it is also planning a push into home robotics. Apple still has a presence in millions of cars through its CarPlay software, a hands-free system that links to drivers’ iPhones and is used by hundreds of different marques including from BMW and Ford.Apple’s shares have languished so far this year as investors grow wary over its growth potential.

2024-04-05 10:06:03+00:00,Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data,"By Katie Paul and Anna TongNEW YORK (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market.Today only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb.

2024-04-05 09:06:00+00:00,Forget Apple: Warren Buffett Has Spent Twice as Much Buying Shares of This Beloved Stock Since 2018,"For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been lapping the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column. As of the closing bell on March 28, 2024, the S&P 500 had gained in the neighborhood of 34,400%, including dividends paid, since Buffett took the reins. In comparison, the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a jaw-dropping aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,126,746% since the mid-1960s!Both professional and retail investors frequently await Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain an understanding of what stocks Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling. While Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding value in plain sight.Something else Warren Buffett is known for is portfolio concentration. Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his team are overseeing a $373 billion portfolio containing 45 stocks and two index funds, the vast majority of Berkshire's invested assets have been put to work in just a few companies -- the ""top ideas.""While 13Fs would give investors the impression that tech titan Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Buffett's unquestioned favorite stock -- Berkshire's Apple stake accounts for 42% ($155 billion) of invested assets -- a deeper dive into how Berkshire Hathaway puts its cash to work points to another even more beloved stock as the Oracle's cream of the crop.Let me preface this discussion by noting that Warren Buffett and his team of investors absolutely love Apple as a business. In fact, Buffett himself described Apple as ""a better business than any we own"" during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting last year. It's why an estimated $36 billion has been put to work by Buffett and Co. in shares of Apple since the start of 2016.There are plenty of reasons for Buffett to feel the way he does about Apple. To start with, it's one of the most valuable brands globally, and it sports an exceptionally loyal customer base. A brand study conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 notes that iPhone users are more likely to stick with Apple for their next smartphone purchase than Samsung owners are to buy another Samsung smartphone.There's also the domestic dominance of Apple's iPhone. Since introducing an iPhone that supports 5G speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has consistently accounted for a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.However, the company's future growth boils down to its shift to subscription services. Although Apple has no intention of abandoning the physical products that brought it fame (the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), focusing on subscription services should provide a lift to its operating margin, enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, and keep customers loyal to its brand.But if you asked Warren Buffett to pinpoint the one aspect about Apple he loves most, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if he flagged Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, Apple has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only do buybacks help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS), they're a means to increase the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. As time passes, Berkshire is becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to buy a single share.But the fact remains that the estimated $36 billion Warren Buffett and his team have put to work in Apple over the past eight years takes a back seat to an even more loved stock.Truth be told, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs fail to tell the full story about the company's holdings or what the Oracle of Omaha has been doing with Berkshire's cash. For a more encompassing view, investors will need to dive into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results.Just prior to the executive certifications at the end of Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly earnings reports is a section on the company's share repurchase activity. The reason I bring this up is because Warren Buffett has spent considerably more buying back Berkshire Hathaway stock than he and his top aides have spent purchasing shares of any other stock, including Apple.During the December-ended quarter, Buffett gave the green light for the repurchase of 3,623 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B), which came at a cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the midpoint of 2018, Buffett and his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who he referred to as the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway"" in his latest annual letter to shareholders, OK'd the repurchase of more than $74 billion worth of their own company's shares. That's more than twice the amount spent buying shares of Apple.Prior to July 2018, Berkshire's share repurchase program only allowed the Oracle of Omaha to buy shares of his company if they traded at or below 120% of book value (no more than 20% of reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire stock never fell to or below this threshold, Warren Buffett was forced to sit on his hands and go years without repurchasing a single share.On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked its buyback criteria:As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet; andWarren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agree their stock is intrinsically cheap, buybacks can be made without any end date or ceiling.Suffice it to say, more than $74 billion in share repurchases over the last 22 quarters makes it plainly obvious that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.Since Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are the easiest way he can reward investors who share his long-term vision. These buybacks are slowly but steadily increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, as well as increasing EPS. In other words, putting his company's cash to work via buybacks is making Berkshire Hathaway more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.With a record $167.6 billion in available cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on the balance sheet, as of the end of 2023, Buffett has more than enough firepower to continue buying back shares of his company.Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-05 08:17:02+00:00,Hon Hai Sales Fall Short of Estimates After iPhone Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. missed revenue estimates in the first quarter after being dragged down by sagging iPhone sales, especially in China.Most Read from BloombergTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 BillionSaudi Crown Prince MBS’s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest FaltersS&P 500 Falls 1% as Oil Jump Spurs Flight to Bonds: Markets WrapGiving Up China Is Hard, Even for Argentina’s Anarcho-CapitalistBiden Tells Netanyahu US Support Hinges on Protecting CiviliansThe biggest iPhone contract manufacturer, also known as Foxconn, said that its March sales were NT$447.5 billion ($14 billion), bringing first-quarter revenue to NT$1.32 trillion, down 9.6% and short of an average of analyst estimates of NT$1.39 trillion.Sales in March rose 11.8% on the prior year after declining by double-digit percentages in the first two months of 2024, and smart consumer electronics sales showed “strong growth,” Taipei-based Hon Hai said in a filing Friday. The company is diversifying its business with greater focus on building data center server racks and other equipment for artificial intelligence clusters. That’s helped its stock reach a record high this year, despite sales of Apple Inc.’s flagship device waning in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.For the current quarter, Hon Hai said it expects sales to grow relative to the same period a year earlier — in line with projections for an 8% rise. The company also anticipates sales to be up for the full year. The AI craze has brought big gains in companies like Nvidia Corp. as investors see massive growth potential for the sector. Foxconn’s AI server revenue is likely to account for 18% of its total sales in 2025, due to a rising share of Nvidia shipments, JPMorgan analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note late March.Still, with Apple’s business making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. iPhone shipments in China fell 33% in February, to only about 2.4 million, according to official data. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.(Updates with additional details from Hon Hai filing)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly SidewaysElon Musk’s X Has a Porn ProblemHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain FutureFixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New PlaneChina’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/hon-hai-sales-fall-short-081702325.html
2024-04-05 08:14:13+00:00,UPDATE 1-Apple supplier Foxconn sees growth in Q2 after dip in Q1 revenue,"(Updates throughout with context, quotes and details on performance in smart consumer electronics products)TAIPEI, April 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and the biggest assembler of Apple's iPhone, said on Friday it expected a rise in second quarter revenue after the previous quarter underperformed market expectations.The first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.Foxconn said in a statement that this year's second quarter ""remains a traditional off-peak season, and major products are entering a period of transition between old and new products"".But it said the outlook for the second quarter would be for growth both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. It did not elaborate and the company does not give numerical guidance.The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$447.54 billion ($13.96 billion), which it said was the second highest figure on record for the same period and represented an on-year rise of 11.8%.For the first quarter, revenue slid 9.6% year-on-year to T$1.322 trillion, underperforming a T$1.401 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.The company said last month it expected first quarter revenue to slightly decline, and noted in its statement the first quarter revenue was in line with its outlook.First quarter revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, declined year-on-year, which it blamed on a high base from last year when it was rushing to fulfil orders after a key factory in China's Zhengzhou re-opened following COVID pandemic-related disruptions.However, for cloud and networking products it said there was significant year-on-year growth in the first three months of the year, ""with strong customers' pull-in for the cloud segment"".Last month, Foxconn adopted a far more bullish outlook for this year, saying on its fourth quarter earnings call that it expected a significant rise in revenue driven by booming demand for artificial intelligence servers.Foxconn's shares have surged 52% so far this year, compared with a 13% jump for the broader market.The company holds its first quarter earnings calls on May 14.

2024-04-05 08:03:00+00:00,"These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Are in the Spotlight for All the Wrong Reasons","Stocks dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" skyrocketed last year, helping the S&P 500 soar into bull market territory. These technology leaders are involved in some of today's hottest areas, from artificial intelligence (AI) to cloud computing services. And thanks to this, their names are highly recognizable: Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) make up this star-studded list.Most of these market giants have continued to soar, led by Nvidia, which has gained 79% so far this year. That helped the S&P 500 rise more than 10% for its best first quarter in five years, and that's kept the Magnificent Seven in the spotlight in 2024. But two members of this elite group no longer are wowing investors, and instead, are in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Let's take a closer look.Which stocks am I talking about? Apple, the maker of world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac, and electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla. These stocks have disappointed investors with their performance over the past few months, falling 11% and 32%, respectively, since the start of the year.In fact, they even weighed negatively on the performance of the S&P 500 in the first quarter, together shaving 1.3 percentage points off the index's return, according to Statista. The chart below shows Apple's -7.1% contribution and Tesla's -5% contribution to the S&P 500's total return for the quarter. These two made the biggest negative contributions to the index.A few reasons may be behind investors' decisions to turn their backs on shares of Apple and Tesla in the first quarter. Let's start with Apple. Yes, the company has grown earnings over time, and its products remain favorites worldwide. For example, Apple, for the first time, took the top seven positions in Counterpoint Research's list of best-selling smartphones in 2023.But some fans still are waiting for the next big innovation from Apple. Though the company recently released its Apple Vision Pro spatial computer earlier this year, it's been met with mixed reviews. Apple also has been slower than other tech giants to detail its plans for AI. So, investors looking to bet on current and future high-growth players may turn away from Apple in favor of a company that offers a solid and clear path to growth over the next few years.Now let's consider Tesla. The company last year made moves such as lowering the prices on certain vehicles to increase volume and cutting production costs, and this is positive. But at the same time, some of Tesla's current efforts are weighing on earnings, and the company also faces headwinds such as competition and negative currency impact.Tesla shares also trade for 57x forward earnings estimates, making them the most expensive of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks by this measure. This clearly could hurt demand for the stock and spur investors to buy shares of cheaper Magnificent Seven players right now.As mentioned above, Nvidia has posted the best performance of all of these companies and contributed the most to the S&P 500's increase so far this year. And for good reason. The tech giant delivered triple-digit gains in revenue and net income in the most recent quarter and just announced the upcoming launch of its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips yet. Investors also are optimistic about the company due to its dominance in the AI chip market, especially considering forecasts that the AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon -- the other top contributors to the S&P 500's first quarter gain -- also are investing heavily in AI. So, investors in the first few months of the year clearly have been aiming to get in on potential AI winners.Does this mean the party is over for Apple and Tesla (and their shareholders)? Not necessarily. The long-term picture remains bright for both of these market leaders.Apple's solid moat -- its brand strength -- should ensure its products' dominance in their markets, and the company's next growth engine may be its services business. Tesla remains the EV leader in the U.S. and is developing the technologies today that could help it stand out over time -- and maintain this leadership.All of this means that, even though Apple and Tesla are standing in the spotlight today for all the wrong reasons, they -- and their investors -- still could score a major win over the long term.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-05 07:40:05+00:00,Apple supplier Foxconn sees growth in Q2 after dip in Q1 revenue,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and the biggest assembler of Apple's iPhone, said on Friday it expected a rise in second quarter revenue after the previous quarter underperformed market expectations.The first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.Foxconn said in a statement that this year's second quarter ""remains a traditional off-peak season, and major products are entering a period of transition between old and new products"".But it said the outlook for the second quarter would be for growth both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. It did not elaborate and the company does not give numerical guidance.The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$447.54 billion ($13.96 billion), which it said was the second highest figure on record for the same period and represented an on-year rise of 11.8%.For the first quarter, revenue slid 9.6% year-on-year to T$1.322 trillion, underperforming a T$1.401 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.The company said last month it expected first quarter revenue to slightly decline, and noted in its statement the first quarter revenue was in line with its outlook.First quarter revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, declined year-on-year, which it blamed on a high base from last year when it was rushing to fulfil orders after a key factory in China's Zhengzhou re-opened following COVID pandemic-related disruptions.However, for cloud and networking products it said there was significant year-on-year growth in the first three months of the year, ""with strong customers' pull-in for the cloud segment"".Last month, Foxconn adopted a far more bullish outlook for this year, saying on its fourth quarter earnings call that it expected a significant rise in revenue driven by booming demand for artificial intelligence servers.Foxconn's shares have surged 52% so far this year, compared with a 13% jump for the broader market.The company holds its first quarter earnings calls on May 14.($1 = 32.0590 Taiwan dollars)(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/foxconn-q1-revenue-drops-9-074005883.html
2024-04-05 05:21:57+00:00,Apple MacBooks Running Low in Indonesia After Fresh Import Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s move to get more goods produced onshore is already starting to backfire, with companies warning that supplies of products including Apple Inc.’s MacBook Pro could start to run out as soon as the end of April.Most Read from BloombergTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 BillionSaudi Crown Prince MBS’s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest FaltersS&P 500 Falls 1% as Oil Jump Spurs Flight to Bonds: Markets WrapGiving Up China Is Hard, Even for Argentina’s Anarcho-CapitalistBiden Tells Netanyahu US Support Hinges on Protecting CiviliansOther goods including Michelin tires and chemicals shipped from Europe may run out over the next few months because of the rule enforced from March 10 that’s seen as an attempt to curb imports of thousands of products, according to people familiar with the matter.While the move was meant to spur global companies to set up production plants onshore, it has instead pushed them to consider scaling back or canceling plans to expand operations, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing sensitive information.President Joko Widodo has presented himself as business-friendly to foreign investors, but he has also railed against imports that compete against local products. That tension is coming to the fore as the import hurdles have ignited furor among top executives at companies from Apple to Michelin and spurred business chambers from the US to South Korea to write letters to his government to review the matter, said the people who asked not to be named discussing sensitive issues.Representatives from Apple as well as Indonesia’s ministries of trade and industry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Michelin said it has been working with associations and other companies facing a similar issue, and it’s optimistic the government will act soon to fix the problem. “Michelin aims at integrating Indonesia fully into its global value chain, and that is why openness to trade is key to us,” it said in an emailed response to Bloomberg.The complex rule effectively restricts imports of about 4,000 products, including finished goods such as laptops and raw materials like hazardous chemicals. To get import permits, companies must get a letter of recommendation from the Ministry of Industry, but the process is onerous — requiring firms to submit tenancy agreements and annual forecasts of items they intend to bring into the country, said the people.The forecasts may be used by the government to set import quotas for certain products, which the companies view as being meant to spur them to set up production facilities onshore to get an upper hand or lose out to rivals because of the quota mechanism, they said.Despite multiple queries from the companies, the government didn’t give any clarity on the implementation since the rule was signed into law in December, the people said. Firms only understood the complexity and ramifications once the regulation was enforced, which is throwing companies into turmoil as they need to plan budgets, logistics and transport for the goods, they said.Firms are now turning to Coordinating Investment and Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Panjaitan, who’s seen as someone who has Jokowi’s ear, to persuade the president to ease the rule. In private conversations, Panjaitan described the rule as potentially injuring Indonesia’s business reputation and economic interests, the people said.A representative for Panjaitan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.--With assistance from Eddie Spence and Eko Listiyorini.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly SidewaysElon Musk’s X Has a Porn ProblemHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain FutureFixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New PlaneChina’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-macbooks-running-low-indonesia-052157345.html
2024-04-04 15:24:22+00:00,"Tesla, Apple off to rocky 2024 start. Could things get worse?","The Magnificent 7 member stocks Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have had a rocky start to 2024, to say the least. Tesla shares have fallen over 30% year-to-date, faced recall problems, and many investors have grown weary of outspoken CEO Elon Musk.Similarly, Apple stock has fallen almost 12% year-to-date while facing multiple downgrades from financial firms and several lawsuits from regulatory agencies.Yahoo Finance Reporters Pras Subramanian and Dan Howley join Yahoo Finance to break down how Tesla and Apple have had such a shaky beginning to the year and how they may operate going forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Stocks are climbing higher this morning, snapping the losses that we saw to kick off the second quarter. The S&P 500 had its best start to the year for the first quarter since 2019, up almost 10% since January 1. Meanwhile, though, there's two large tech companies, Apple and Tesla, that have lagged far behind.To help us break down what went wrong with these two companies and what that tells us here about what's to come in the coming quarter, we've got team coverage for you. Pras Subramanian, Dan Howley here to break it all down for us. Let's start with you.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Seana, yeah, so we focused a lot on Tesla this week with the EV company missing Q1 deliveries by about 46,000 vehicles and 8.5% drop from last year. But Tesla's problems didn't just begin this week. So far this year, the stock is down over 30% with interest rates remaining high, many consumers are opting not to purchase big ticket items especially with the company slow to spruce up their aging models.Adding in competitors like China rolling out cheaper EV options and you can start to see why deliveries are down globally. On top of all this, Tesla is currently dealing with an image problem. Many investors have found CEO Elon Musk's attitude and statements to be volatile to say the least. And a litany of investigations related to Tesla's self-driving systems have made the product less appealing to consumers.Now, investors are looking to that first quarter report on April 23 for some signs of upside. Dan, I know you've been watching Apple. What's going on over there with them in Cupertino?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it has not been a great 2024 for Apple stock so far. It's down almost 12% from the beginning of the year. There's been a few factors that have caused this. It all started at the beginning of the year when three big stock downgrades kicked everything off. Barclays, Piper Sandler, and then Redburn Atlantic all cutting the company within the first 10 days of 2024 on fears of slowing iPhone sales and the potential for regulatory headwinds. We'll get there in just one second.Then just over a week later, the tech giant was forced to sell a modified version of its latest Apple Watches because of a patent dispute that was over that blood oxygen sensor. Apple then kicked off February with disappointing first quarter results with sales in China down 13% compared to the year prior and forecasting a 5% drop in revenue for its upcoming second quarter. By the end of February, Bloomberg reported that Apple ditched its EV project that had been speculating for 10 years. So sayonara to that.In March, on the 4th, the EU slapped Apple with a $2 billion fine over its App Store practices. And then on March 21, Apple got hit with an antitrust suit from the Department of Justice, alleging the tech giant monopolized the smartphone market. Now, we're getting reports that Apple is exploring home robot technology. Investors will be looking out to see how the company is looking to innovate.

2024-04-04 15:22:19+00:00,Apple’s electric car loss could be home robotics’ gain,"For every tech success story, there are countless projects that slam headlong into the brick wall of reality. Apple’s electric vehicle ambitions are one of the most recent -- and, frankly, best -- examples of a project failing in spite of seeming to have everything going for it.The jury is still out on the ultimate fate of the Vision Pro, but at the very least, Apple’s mixed reality headset demonstrates that the company isn’t afraid to keep trying where pretty much everyone else has failed. With the Apple Car firmly in the rearview, the company is reportedly exploring yet another notoriously difficult path: home robots.The category is both unique and uniquely difficult for a number of reasons. One thing that sets it apart from other categories is the fact that there’s been precisely one success story: the robot vacuum. It’s been 22 years since the first Roomba was introduced, and for the past two decades, an entire industry (including iRobot itself) has been chasing that success.iRobot’s inability to strike gold a second time is not for lack of trying. In the nearly quarter-century since it introduced Roomba, it’s given us gutter clearers, pool cleaners, lawn mowers and even a Roomba specifically designed to remove screws and other hardware detritus off garage floors. In spite of those efforts, however, the company has fared best when it focused its resources back into its robot vacuum.Image Credits: iRobotThe robot vacuum succeeded for the same reason any robot has ever succeeded: It was a product built to perform a single in-demand task repetitively to the best of its ability. To this day, vacuums are the battlefield on which the home robot wars are fought. Take the well-funded Bay Area startup Matic. The former Google/Nest engineers who founded the company believe the next breakthrough in the home will be built on the foundation of robot vacuums. Their case, in part, is that iRobot effectively painted itself into a corner with its puck-like form factor.Those early Roombas weren’t built with today’s sensing and mapping capabilities in mind. Matic believes that by simply making the robot taller, you dramatically improve its vantage point. This was also the driver behind the most interesting innovation found on Amazon’s Astro home robot: the periscope camera.Image Credits: AmazonThe fact is that home robot functionality is severely hampered by form factor. The hockey puck design that’s prevalent across robot vacuums isn’t ideal for anything beyond the core functionality it's built for. To effectively perform more of the sorts of tasks people might desire in a home robot, the hardware needs to get more complex. Mobile manipulators are a great moving target. That is to say, if you want a helping hand, a hand is a good place to start.Like so many other things in this world, however, mobile manipulators are deceptively difficult. In fact, industrial robotics haven’t cracked it yet. Big, bolted-down arms are common in manufacturing, and wheeled autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) like Locus and Kiva are common in warehouses, but the middle ground between the two hasn’t been firmly established. This is a big part of the reason the human element remains important in that world. It’s a problem that will be solved soon enough, but it seems likely it will happen with these more expensive industrial machines well before it makes its way into more affordable home robots (as a rule, corporations generally have deeper pockets than people).This is also a big part of the reason many are championing the humanoid form factor in the workplace (human beings, after all, offer a kind of mobile manipulation). But that’s a longwinded think piece for another day.Image Credits: Hello RoboticsMobile manipulation isn’t entirely out of reach for home robots. Hello Robot’s Stretch is probably the most compelling example at the moment. Rather than a humanoid form factor, the robot looks like a Roomba with a pole mounted in its center. This houses both an imaging system and an arm that moves up and down to clasp objects (dishes, laundry) at different heights. Of course, some tasks are more easily accomplished with two arms -- and suddenly you start to see why so many robotics firms have effectively backward-engineered humanoids.In its current form, Stretch is prohibitively expensive at $24,950. That’s likely a big part of the reason the company is selling it as a development platform. Interestingly, Matic sees its own robot as a kind of development platform -- using vacuuming as a gateway into additional home chores.Another issue with Stretch is that it’s teleoperated (the company sent us a note after this published stating that some developers have created autonomous functions). There’s nothing wrong with teleop in many scenarios, but it seems unlikely that people are going to flock to a home robot that’s being controlled by a human somewhere far away.Navigation is another key barrier to the home. Compared to warehouses and factories, homes are relatively unstructured environments. They differ greatly from one to another, lighting tends to be all over the place and humans are constantly moving stuff around and dropping things on the floor.Matic's vacuum uses an array of cameras to map spaces -- and understand where it is in them. Image Credits: MaticThe world of self-driving has faced its own obstacles on this front. But the key difference between an autonomous robot on the highway and another in the home is that the worst the latter is probably going to do is knock something off a shelf. That’s bad, but very rarely does it result in death. With self-driving cars, on the other hand, any accident represents a significant step back for the industry. The technology is -- perhaps understandably -- being held to a higher standard than its human counterpart.While adoption of self-driving technologies is well behind the curve that many anticipated, largely for the above safety reason, many of the technologies developed for the category have helped quietly kickstart their own robotics revolution, as autonomous vehicles take over farms and sidewalks.This is likely a big part of the reason it might view home robots as “the next big thing” (to quote Bloomberg quoting its sources). Apple has no doubt pumped a tremendous amount of resources into driving technologies. If those could be repurposed for a different project, maybe it won’t all be for naught.While the reports note that Apple “hasn’t committed” to either the robotic smart screen or mobile robot that are said to exist somewhere inside the company’s skunkworks, it has already put Apple Home execs Matt Costello and Brian Lynch on the hardware side of things, while SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea is said to be involved on the AI side of things.Image Credits: Brian HeaterGiven the proximity to its home efforts, one can imagine the company working on its own version of Amazon’s Astro -- though that project currently exists as more of a cautionary tale for the time being. The project has been hamstrung by high cost and a lack of useful features to justify it. The system also effectively served as a mobile Alexa portal, and home assistants have largely fallen out of fashion of late.Apple does have some robotics expertise -- though nothing approaching what Amazon has on its industrial side. The company has been involved in the production of robot arms like Daisy, which salvages key metals from discarded iPhones. That’s still a pretty large leap to a home robot.Perhaps the company could take a more Vision Pro-like approach to the category, which has a heavy focus on developer contributions. Doing so, however, would require an extremely versatile hardware platform, which would almost certainly be cost-prohibitive for most consumers, making the Vision Pro’s $3,500 price tag look like small potatoes.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/apples-electric-car-loss-could-be-home-robotics-gain/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-electric-car-loss-could-222232498.html

This represents a big win for the Magic Kingdom, ending months of uncertainty and distraction for CEO Bob Iger. But Disney faces an uphill battle as the company attempts to navigate consumers, shift away from cable, and path towards more profitable less profitable, I should say, streaming services.DAN HOWLY: And Apple is exploring the field of personal robotics according to Bloomberg. The engineers at the company are looking into a robot that can follow users around their homes. The company is also reportedly developing a tabletop home device that uses robotics to move a display around. The efforts are in their early stages, but could represent a significant move after the company scrapped its long-gestating electric vehicle project back in February.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/stock-market-disney-board-victory-131901044.html

2024-04-04 12:03:38+00:00,Apple’s New Robot Ambitions – Can Home Tech Drive Stock to New Highs?,"As the electric vehicle (EV) market heats up with new players like Xiaomi (1810) joining the race, Apple (AAPL) has thrown a curveball. Following the shuttering of its electric car project, Bloomberg reports that the tech giant is making a strategic shift. Apple appears to be setting its sights on a potentially game-changing frontier: personal robotics for the home.Personal robotics isn’t just about the cool robots you see in sci-fi movies. The company might be thinking about developing a new generation of intelligent machines designed to seamlessly integrate into your life, tackling everyday tasks within your living space.“Engineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes” declared people familiar with the project to Bloomberg.Think beyond basic chores like smart vacuuming and mopping your floors by navigating obstacles and adjusting cleaning modes for different surfaces. One might imagine a robot that assists with meal prep, chopping vegetables, setting timers, and even suggesting recipes based on your dietary needs. It could also become a companion for your children, engaging them with interactive games, reading stories, or even providing educational help.Could personal robotics be Apple’s next big thing, propelling its stock price to new highs? Only time will tell, but one thing’s for sure: the future of smart homes just got a whole lot more interesting, with the new giant joining the effort of other big tech companies in the smart home market like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Samsung (005930).Apple’s stock has hit a rough patch in 2024. Since January, shares have dipped more than 8.5%, falling short of their record highs set mid December 2023 above $197.50. Despite the recent decline, Apple’s year-over-year performance remains positive, with a gain of around 2.4%.In February 2024, Apple made a significant change to its product development roadmap. The company decided to discontinue its electric vehicle project, codenamed “Titan” internally, which had been in operation since 2014. Apple’s decision to enter the electric vehicle market back then coincided with a period of heightened interest in self-driving technology among major technology companies.Additionally, analysts believe Apple may have been exploring new avenues for growth as the market for its core products, such as iPhones, were expected to show signs of slowing down. The potential for a revolutionary new product category like a self-driving electric car could have been seen as a way to diversify Apple’s product portfolio and secure future revenue streams.Despite a decade of development and reportedly over $10 billion in investment, Apple ultimately decided to discontinue Project Titan. The technical challenges of creating a safe and reliable self-driving system proved to be a major hurdle. These challenges encompassed not only sensor technology but also intricate safety protocols and the ability to navigate diverse road conditions effectively among other complexities that presented significant obstacles for Apple’s engineers.Furthermore, and maybe the most important aspect, the financial burden of developing a revolutionary electric car, particularly one with autonomous capabilities, weighed heavily and became a significant financial drain, potentially impacting resources available for other Apple endeavors.This combination of technical hurdles and financial strain likely tipped the scales in Apple’s decision to abandon Project Titan. However, Apple has a history of strategic adaptation. Now the company has pivoted towards personal robotics, which suggests a focus on a potentially more lucrative market with a faster path to profitability. Personal robots are likely to offer a quicker return on investment compared to the long-term development cycle inherent in self-driving car technology.Apple has consistently pushed boundaries and diversified its product portfolio in recent years. The company’s success extends beyond iconic devices like the iPhone and Mac.The Apple Watch, a health-oriented smartwatch, established Apple’s presence in the wearables market. It offers a range of features, including fitness tracking, health monitoring (like heart rate and ECG), and communication functionalities (calls and texts) within a sleek and user-friendly design.Apple’s Vision Pro VR headset is another example of the company’s involvement in cutting-edge technologies. This VR headset contributes to the ongoing development of virtual reality experiences.Their recently announced “ReaLM” AI system, short for “Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,” hints at their ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. The company seems to be actively working on improving the natural language processing capabilities of its AI, potentially paving the way for more nuanced and intuitive interactions with future Apple devices and services.While still in the early stages of development, Apple’s foray into home robotics signifies another step in this diversification strategy. While the project’s final form remains uncertain, it demonstrates Apple’s commitment to catering to the evolving needs of its customers by potentially integrating intelligent robots into our daily lives.The upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) scheduled for June 10-14, 2024, could be a pivotal moment for Apple’s home robot project.This event, known for showcasing Apple’s latest software and hardware advancements, might offer fans a glimpse of the future through early concepts, prototypes, or even design mockups. Additionally, WWDC announcements about software features or tools could provide clues about how Apple plans to integrate these potential robots with existing ecosystems like Siri or HomeKit.For investors, WWDC could be equally informative. While Apple might not reveal everything, the conference could offer valuable insights into the project’s overall scope. Investors might glean details about the robots’ intended functionalities, target market, and potential launch timelines. This information can be crucial in assessing the potential impact on Apple’s future revenue streams.DisclaimerCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.

2024-04-04 11:44:53+00:00,Not UK Or Japan: India To Emerge As Apple's Third-Largest iPhone Market In Just 2 Years,"This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.By 2026, India is set to surpass both Japan and the UK to become the third-largest iPhone market for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), according to a report by Counterpoint Research.Apple witnessed a significant milestone in India in 2023 as iPhone shipments crossed the 10 million mark for the first time, thus leading to revenue generation.See also: X Launches Community Notes In India, Just In Time For ElectionsInterestingly, iPhones produced in India contributed 13% to the global shipments in 2023, representing an impressive leap from a mere 1% in 2018. This surge is attributed to Apple's growing brand affinity in the country, positioning India as the technology giant's fastest-growing market in the forthcoming years.Looking forward, it is projected that by 2025, Apple's services sector will account for a quarter of its total revenue, with expectations of crossing the $100 billion mark annually. The thriving Apple ecosystem, sustained by an installed base of over two billion devices, is driven by services like the Apple Store, Apple Care+, and the AppleOne subscription.Introduced in 2023, the Apple One subscription is expected to significantly boost Apple's service revenue, underlining the crucial role played by the iPhone within Apple's ecosystem. As Apple continues to penetrate emerging markets, the demand for iPhones not only bolsters its sales but also fosters growth across Apple's product range, luring new users into the iOS ecosystem.Read next: Tesla Scouts For Locations In India For A Proposed $2Bn-$3Bn Electric Car PlantPhoto via Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Not UK Or Japan: India To Emerge As Apple's Third-Largest iPhone Market In Just 2 Years originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-04-04 11:00:00+00:00,"Four reasons to buy Apple stock, despite its headwinds: Analyst","From a Department of Justice lawsuit to slowing iPhone sales in China, there are plenty of headwinds for Apple (AAPL) investors to worry about. Those worries are reflected in the stock price, which has fallen more than 10% so far this year. Could it be a buying opportunity?Piper Sandler Managing Director and Chief Market Technician Craig Johnson argues ""Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time,"" given that there is, he argues, a potential for a broader market pullback. Johnson acknowledges the company faces headwinds but is still a ""high quality, blue chip company that's been doing very well for a very extended period of time.""Watch the video above to hear Johnson's four reasons why now is the time to buy Apple.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich[AUDIO LOGO]- Apple continuing to be in what you could call a difficult period. The tech giant coming off its worst quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 in over a decade as it's dealing with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union to top it all off. Shareholders waiting for positive signs that could spur rotation for the tech giant. So to discuss what's next for Apple, we've got Craig Johnson Piper Sandler Managing Director and Chief Market technician. Craig, thank you so much for being here with us. Talk to me about what's next for Apple. Is there any potential for further downside from here?CRAIG JOHNSON: Well, you know, there's a lot of headwinds. There's no question for Apple at this point in time. But when you step back and you look at the company overall, I mean, it is a very, obviously, high-quality blue chip company that's been doing very well for a very extended period of time. You could also add to the list of problems that handset sales have not been terrific in China. But at this point in time with a market that looks like it's setting itself up for a good 5% to 10% correction, Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time because it has got, A, a great balance sheet, B, a highly repeatable business model, C, good margins, and, D, I would say, they're buying back quite a bit of stock.So if you're looking to put money in sort of a-- call it a safe-haven trade at this point in time and a company that's got a better balance sheet than the US government, you know, Apple is probably going to be the safe-haven trade. And when you look at the chart that we've got here this morning, you can see that you're still in a very nice longer term upward trending channel, you're now the midpoint of that channel. And from a risk reward standpoint, you've got probably about 10% downside, 20% upside. So despite the disappointment and underperformance this year, this could be a rotational stock for investors that are looking to hide.SEANA SMITH: All right, Craig. We have one of the charts here up on your screen. You outline some critical levels that need to be watched here within some recent reports just in terms of the pullback that we have seen in Apple, whether or not it's going to test that October low of 16567. Craig, When we talk about whether or not the worst of it is behind it for Apple, is it fair to say that you think that is the case?CRAIG JOHNSON: Well, from a pure risk reward standpoint, there's probably going to be further negative headlines coming with all these antitrust issues that get played out. That being said, thinking about differentiating the company from the stock itself, you look at the stock itself, again, you got probably 10% downside risk and about 20% upside, so 2 to 1 risk reward at this point in time. And also just note there's a lot of investors that have owned the stock over the years don't want to sell it for tax purposes at this point in time. So I think they're going to be pretty patient with the stock. And as the stock pulls back in here, I don't think you're going to get as much selling pressure simply because this is such a well-loved company and a company that's got such a solid balance sheet.- So not only could the worst be over for Apple. But do you see a potential upside to Apple particularly as investors-- I know you've mentioned kind of trade in and out of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Is there a potential upside ahead here?CRAIG JOHNSON: Yeah, absolutely. The stock could certainly trade back up to the upper end of the trading range, which is closer to 180. Again, that's a nice setup from here at these levels. And again there's new innovative products coming out, like the Apple Vision Pro. It's going to be small initially. But for those that have looked at that new particular product, it's a pretty impressive product with a lot of capabilities and certainly helps lay out the roadmap for what's ahead. So there are some positive things on the horizon for Apple that we shouldn't ignore.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/four-reasons-buy-apple-stock-110000186.html
2024-04-04 08:32:46+00:00,"The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter","The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.The quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program, and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.Speaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.Oh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.Let’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.Shares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.Also this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US.The cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.Apple, meanwhile, made headlines for ending its electric car project. According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.Finally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.Things weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms, including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.The FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”The upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power.It’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).The DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball, though, and is looking into whether they’re complying or not.The hits kept coming for Google during the quarter after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis, among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.Congress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.Nothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware.According to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.Finally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up, and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat.It’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement. That is to say, the good stories could flip and become bad or ugly and vice versa. On to Q2.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

""The service sent a letter to the company about the need to submit a detailed, motivated position on this issue to the agency.""Apple last month made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe, saying developers would be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.

2024-04-03 21:20:46+00:00,Apple steps into automated home devices: Bloomberg,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to get into development for in-home robotics, according to a report from Bloomberg, as the company has abandoned its electric vehicle project. The report specifically details that Apple engineers are looking to develop mobile robots that can follow users inside their home.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins Yahoo Finance to break down why a project of this nature is unusual for the tech giant.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Apple reportedly exploring the home robotics scene. This is according to Bloomberg here with all the details is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right we're talking about the potential for an in-home robot. Now, as Josh you said, this is from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. And this is essentially something that we've seen somewhat before. Amazon has its own robot currently called Astro. And it's an in-home robot. It follows you around. It can carry things from room to room, like a soda can or something. It's not going to pick up your laundry and carry it for you, though that would be awesome.And it acts as kind of an in-home sentry to a degree, trying to make sure things are askew or someone's doing something around your house that you don't necessarily want intruders more likely. But this is still something that's very much early in development. According to the report, they could use things like some of the technology from the car that was in development and then canceled some of the technology to help navigate around the home. That could come from some of the car stuff. So there's things already in the works or that were in the works that could be repurposed for this.I think the bigger question is whether people want a robot following them around their home or something along those lines. And you know, Amazon's Astro is still a very niche product, relatively small, and expensive. I think if people were clamoring for something like this, they would have brought it up already. It's not going to be like Rosey from ""The Jetsons,"" it's not going to talk to you or anything like that. It's going to be just a little robot that follows you around, if that's what Apple actually ends up coming out with.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I-- as somebody shared a tweet with from the team like, if the robot is not going to do my dishes and clean my house so that I can do stuff I want to do, and I don't know how interested I am. But speaking of Amazon as well, they are also making some changes to personnel. Some of this has to do with the reporting that we heard about recently that they were closing some of their in-person stores, but it does seem to be more than that. What's going on there?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. This is related to one of their segments, it's called the sales marketing and global services organization. They're laying off a few hundred people there. They say that it's a result of different changes that they're making to training. They're going to do self-service training, things like that.They're also going to be eliminating some people who worked with the physical stores related to a shift away from in some of the stores from, the larger stores, the kind of technology that allows you to just walk out with goods. So it would use cameras around, allow you to just pick up what you want and take off. And the changes there seem to be that they're going to start removing those from larger grocery stores but use them in smaller stores.And if you haven't used it before, it's basically you go in, you pick something up off the shelf. Cameras around are able to see what you're grabbing. And then you leave, and it's charged to your card that you have on file when you initially walk in. And so what they're going to change that to is potentially some of the smarter shopping carts that they have where you can actually scan items as you drop them into your cart.So you wouldn't-- they're not fully eliminating the just walk-out technology. That's going to be something that's more for smaller stores, think things like airports, Amazon Go stores, things like that. So it's just not going to be in the broader, larger scale stores.It feels as though we're getting kind of a push back against that technology. I know there's been some of those self-checkout lines that are getting less of an emphasis. We're seeing some real-life cashiers come back in to replace them. And it's just, when it comes to those self-checkout lines, they're just a pain. I mean, every five seconds, they're going off. And you need someone to come over and help you anyway. So we're seeing more of a movement away from that.But Amazon just making this change on its own as far as the larger grocery stores go.JOSH LIPTON: Dan Howley, thank you appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-steps-automated-home-devices-212046802.html

2024-04-03 20:10:26+00:00,Apple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car Fizzles,"(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, a field with the potential to become one of the company’s ever-shifting “next big things,” according to people familiar with the situation.Most Read from BloombergKim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War ScenariosTSMC Facilities to Resume Production Overnight After QuakeA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger AheadTrump Media’s Business Doesn’t MatterApple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car FizzlesEngineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.Though the effort is still in the beginning stages — and it’s unclear if the products will ultimately be released — Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.With robotics, Apple could gain a bigger foothold in consumers’ homes and capitalize on advances in artificial intelligence. But it’s not yet clear what approach it might take. Though the robotic smart display is much further along than the mobile bot, it has been added and removed from the company’s product road map over the years, according to the people.The robotics work is happening within Apple’s hardware engineering division and its AI and machine-learning group, which is run by John Giannandrea. Matt Costello and Brian Lynch — two executives focused on home products — have overseen the hardware development. Still, Apple hasn’t committed to either project as a company, and the work is still considered to be in the early research phase. A spokeswoman declined to comment.Apple investors reacted coolly to the news, with the stock paring earlier gains after Bloomberg reported on the robotics work. It was up less than 1% at $169.65 at the close in New York. Shares of Roomba maker iRobot Corp., meanwhile, briefly jumped as much as 17% — a sign investors thought it might benefit from Apple’s interest in the field. But the rally faded, and the stock gained less than 2% by the close.Before the EV project was canceled, Apple told its top executives that the company’s future revolved around three areas: automotive, the home and mixed reality. But now the car isn’t happening and Apple has already released its first mixed-reality product, the Vision Pro headset. So the focus has shifted to other future opportunities, including how Apple can better compete in the smart home market.Read More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace HeadsetsThe table-top robotics project first excited senior Apple executives a few years ago, including hardware engineering chief John Ternus and members of the industrial design team. The idea was to have the display mimic the head movements — such as nodding — of a person on a FaceTime session. It would also have features to precisely lock on to a single person among a crowd during a video call.But the company has been concerned about whether consumers would be willing to pay top dollar for such a device. There have also been technical challenges related to balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand. The primary obstacle has been disagreement among Apple executives over whether to move forward with the product at all, according to the people.Near its campus in Cupertino, California, Apple has a secret facility that resembles the inside of a house — a site where it can test future devices and initiatives for the home. Apple has been exploring other ideas for that market, including a new home hub device with an iPad-like display.Apple’s pursuit of the “next big thing” has been an obsession since the Steve Jobs era. But it’s become harder to envision a product that could ever match the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of the company’s $383.3 billion in sales last year.A car had the potential to add hundreds of billions of dollars to Apple’s revenue, in part because the vehicles were expected to sell for roughly $100,000 a pop. Few other products have that kind of growth potential, but Apple has a number of projects in the works, including an updated Vision Pro, touch-screen Macs, AirPods with built-in cameras, and new health technologies like a noninvasive blood sugar monitor.Artificial intelligence is another major focus, even if Apple is playing catch-up in the realm of chatbots and other generative technology. That’s where there could be some overlap with the robotics work. While still in the earliest stages, Apple AI researchers are investigating the use of algorithms to help bots navigate cluttered spaces within people’s homes.Read More: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTakeIf the work advances, Apple wouldn’t be the first tech giant to develop a home robot. Amazon.com Inc. introduced a model called Astro in 2021 that currently costs $1,600. But the company was slow to offer the device in major quantities, and it remains a niche product. The company debuted a more business-focused version of the rolling bot last year designed to work as a security guard.Perhaps the most popular home robot remains the Roomba vacuum, which debuted more than two decades ago. Amazon agreed to acquire iRobot in 2022, but regulatory opposition ultimately doomed the deal. Other companies have also presented the idea of humanoid robots that mimic the size and movements of people.A silver lining to Apple’s failed car endeavor is that it provided the underpinnings for other initiatives. The neural engine — the company’s AI chip inside of iPhones and Macs — was originally developed for the car. The project also laid the groundwork for the Vision Pro because Apple investigated the use of virtual reality while driving.The robot work got a similar start, originating within Apple’s Titan car project around 2019. That’s when the effort was run by Doug Field, now a top EV executive at Ford Motor Co.At the time, Field tapped a series of executives to work on robotics initiatives, ranging from nearly silent indoor drones to home robots. The group included Lynch; Nick Sims, a former Google home products manager; and Dave Scott, who left Apple in 2021 to briefly run a mobile MRI machine company and then returned in 2022 to work on the Vision Pro. Hanns Wolfram Tappeiner, the co-founder of AI and robotics company Anki, is also involved.Soon after Field left Apple in 2021, the robotics work was shifted to the home devices group. And at least one former hardware team from the shuttered car project was recently repurposed to the work on home devices and robotics. The car’s operating system — dubbed by some as safetyOS — could also theoretically be tailored for robots, according to people familiar with the effort.The original concept for the robot was a device that could navigate entirely on its own without human intervention — like the car — and serve as a videoconferencing tool. One pie-in-the-sky idea within Apple was having it be able to handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink. But that would require overcoming extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges — something that’s unlikely this decade.On its website, Apple is advertising for robotics-related roles, indicating that it’s trying to expand the teams working on the project.“Our team works at the intersection of modern machine learning and robotics to shape the AI that will power the next generation of Apple products,” according to the description of one job. “We are looking for innovative and hardworking ML and robotics researchers and engineers that help us research, define, and develop complex intelligent robotic systems and experiences in the real world.”(Updates share reaction in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s X Has a Porn ProblemHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain FutureHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly SidewaysEV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China’s Car KingCanada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-explores-home-robotics-potential-192413172.html
2024-04-03 14:36:00+00:00,"Dan Ives Just Said Microsoft's ""iPhone Moment"" Is Here. Here's What That Means.","Chatter surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the technology sector for over a year now. Big tech is leading the charge in the AI revolution, but one company in particular could be separating from the pack.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a major investor in OpenAI, the home of ChatGPT. The Windows developer has swiftly integrated OpenAI's features across its ecosystem, and one Wall Street analyst is sounding the alarm.Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to proclaim that Microsoft's ""iPhone moment"" has arrived.Apple is one of the most recognized brands around the world. The company completely disrupted personal computing and music streaming with the introduction of the iMac and iPod.But perhaps Apple's greatest achievement was its foray into mobile communications. The iPhone is undoubtedly one of the most successful devices ever released. While Apple was already known for its innovation, the iPhone put Apple in the driver's seat among consumer electronics businesses.For years, Microsoft was known for its Windows operating system. Moreover, a series of acquisitions primarily under former CEO Steve Ballmer helped create the illusion that Microsoft was evolving into a more ubiquitous platform. However, investors eventually soured on this narrative -- leaving some to question where Microsoft was headed.Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella, has been at Microsoft's helm since 2014. Over the last decade, Nadella has transformed Microsoft into a major player in cloud computing. But with fierce competitors such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, the cloud narrative needed a new chapter.In January 2023, Microsoft made waves after it announced a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. While this may have been no more than an intriguing headline for some, Microsoft quickly made it clear that it was going all in on AI.One of the core new services Microsoft is marketing as part of its AI campaign is called CoPilot. While the product is fairly new, Microsoft's big bet on AI appears to be paying off in spades.Per the company's most recent earnings call, CoPilot is seeing success in many areas across Microsoft's ecosystem. For example, the company's developer platform, GitHub, has 1.3 million CoPilot subscribers. This has led to a 40% annual increase in GitHub revenue, as of Dec. 31.Moreover, CoPilot can integrate with apps offered by leading enterprise software platforms such as ServiceNow and Salesforce.Microsoft's most lucrative opportunity related to AI may reside in its Azure cloud suite. Although the company's cloud platform was already performing at a respectable level, integrating ChatGPT into Azure has led to a new wave of growth. In fact, the reinvention of Azure had Nadella boasting that Microsoft has ""moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.""Ives currently has a price target of $500 for Microsoft stock, implying about 19% upside as of market close on March 29.While this is encouraging, I am more intrigued by Nadella's statement. Both Amazon and Alphabet are also looking to leverage AI to bolster their respective cloud businesses. But Microsoft may have the edge in this regard.It's still early days for ChatGPT and its development. And yet, in about a year's time, Microsoft has already generated impressive returns from the partnership. But at 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft stock is by no means cheap. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of the S&P 500 is currently 20.7.Nevertheless, I think Microsoft's premium valuation is warranted. The company is emerging as one of the leaders of the AI realm, and I agree with Ives' position that the company's ""iPhone moment"" is here. AI represents an important new chapter for Microsoft, and I am optimistic that the company can keep its momentum up.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-04-03 14:14:12+00:00,Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Talking About These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC tried to get to the bottom of the recent market decline amid rising yields and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plan. Cramer said that the latest market decline was not ""consequential"" because if the upcoming jobs report comes in weaker than expected, the market will rebound as people would expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to avoid a hard landing. Cramer said it's been a while since we saw a broader selloff, so we ""forgot"" how to ""handle"" one.The CNBC host tried to get to the ""real reasons"" behind the latest selloff and found them in earnings, which he said are always important for him. Cramer first talked about payroll solutions company Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) which recently posted downbeat sales for the fiscal third quarter ending February 29, 2024. Cramer specifically highlighted Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO comments delivered during the company's latest earnings call where he talked about some trends he's seeing in the jobs market.""But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now.Our clients tell us they still can’t find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients."" [read the full earnings call transcript here.]Cramer then turned to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he believes does not deserve to be in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks anymore. Cramer said that the problems Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing have to do with the overall declining demand for EVs in the US. He said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing what Ford and GM had already faced.Cramer said that the ""real problem"" with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is that it turned out to be a car company instead of an ""immortal tech company."" However, Cramer said Tesla is a ""headline grabber"" and it always will be.Jim Cramer reiterated that we should always expect a 10% pullback on average every two years, based on the analysis of legendary economist Peter Lynch.  He also said that there weren’t ""many"" stocks that saw declines in the latest selloff. Instead, he thinks most of the losses were seen by individual stocks based on specific events and catalysts. Cramer thinks the market was overbought and the selloff was due, and he said it's not over yet. Cramer recommend investors to ""hunker down"" and wait for the markets to rebound.Jim Cramer has been recommending mega-cap quality names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past few months as he's highly bullish on the AI revolution that is boosting several names under his coverage.MethodologyFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few weeks and picked some of the most important stocks he discussed. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, where applicable. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/AOn March 26, when Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) was skyrocketing, Cramer said on CNBC that if I were Donald Trump ""this is the moment"" when you'd say it's time to release more shares.""I am not sure where Mr. Trump's head is, but this is a moment where he could say, look, the stock's up 286%. No one would mind if I sold stock, so please let me do it.""Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) shares have pared gains since. The stock is down 26% over the past five days as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) recently revealed that it had a net loss of about $58 million in 2023, while revenue in the period was $4.1 million.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 14Jim Cramer is highly bearish on mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). A caller recently asked Cramer whether he should buy AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) stock for dividends. Cramer’s reply was a resounding “No.” He asked the questioner to see how the stock has performed over the past few years, or “any period” for that matter. Cramer said this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” Cramer is bearish on AGNC but recommends buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for the long term.As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). The biggest stakeholder of AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) during this period was Karim Abbadi and Edward Mcbride’s Centiva Capital which owns a $16 million stake in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Water handling and recycling solutions company Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about recently. Cramer said that he’s a bit late to the stock since Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have “almost doubled.” Cramer said he’d wait for a pullback in the stock price.“Let’s see if we can get it back to $10.”Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have gained about 64% so far this year.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 29Texas-based software company Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) stock is a Buy, according to Jim Cramer. When asked about the stock, Cramer said that it's a very ""well-run"" company. He also said that a government business is a ""good business.""Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) is one of the stocks seeing heavy insider selling activity this year. John S Marr Jr, Tyler Technologies Inc's (NYSE:TYL) former CEO and current executive chairman of the board, sold 7,500 shares of Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) on March 13 at $425.07 per share.Here is what Andvari Associates has to say about Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. Companies with high growth prospects, like Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), also declined. A third group also declined: our investments in fixed income and preferred securities for retirement accounts naturally declined in value as the prices of these securities go down when interest rates go up.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 45Jim Cramer is bullish on automated electronic broker platform company Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR). When asked about the stock in a latest program, Cramer said that it’s an “incredibly well-run company” and “everybody feels that way.” In the same vein Jim Cramer also recommended investors to consider buying Charles Schwab shares. In addition to IBKR, Cramer is recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) shares have gained about 39% over the past one year.TimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Third quarter’s earnings were above consensus estimates, aided by the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses. Despite the beat, its shares lost -4% due to reduced expectations around inorganic account growth as two new Asian broker relationships have been pushed out.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 51Jim Cramer hit the “Buy, Buy, Buy” button on Texas-based construction engineering company Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) during a latest Lightning Round segment of his program Mad Money on CNBC. Cramer said that Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is “just fantastic.” He said Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is a great infrastructure player.“I think you’ve got a winner there.”Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Along with DexCom, notable adds in the quarter included Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) and Jabil. Quanta provides outsourced skilled labor for maintenance and construction services, primarily to utilities. We have followed the company for over a decade and have witnessed its shift from oil and gas to renewables. The energy transition (solar and wind farms, electric vehicles, etc.) requires investments in the US energy grid to support greater electrification. At the same time, climate change is increasing stress on the existing grid, forcing utilities to increase maintenance spending. Furthermore, Federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, will help fuel Quanta’s long-term growth given its expertise in transmission and distribution connections as renewable energy infrastructure seeks to connect to the grid. The stock sold off early in the quarter on concerns that higher interest rates would lead to a pullback in renewables investments by utility customers. However, based on our industry research, we think Quanta’s key customers are well resourced and committed to meeting long-term electrification needs via infrastructure investment. We used the selloff as an opportunity to move the position into the CropSM at a more attractive valuation.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Talking About These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsJim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 StocksDisclosure.

2024-04-03 12:30:00+00:00,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven."" Instead, Look at the ""Fab Four.""","After enduring a lengthy bear market, technology stocks came roaring back last year, led by the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. These industry leaders were among the top gainers in the Nasdaq Composite in 2023, helping lift the tech-heavy index out of the doldrums, with the group generating gains of more than 111%, on average.Here's how members performed in 2023:Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- Up 239%Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) -- Up 194%Tesla -- Up 102%Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- Up 81%Alphabet -- Up 58%Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- Up 57%Apple -- Up 48%However, the onset of 2024 changed the paradigm of the group, and the performances of some stocks are beginning to diverge. In fact, a report in The Wall Street Journal suggests the Magnificent Seven ""is now the Fab Four,"" made up of a subset of the original septet.Let's look at the Fab Four and see what sets them apart.It isn't surprising to see Nvidia stock top the list, up 81% so far this year (as of this writing). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized video games, and those same processors proved equally adept at handling the rigors of AI.Nvidia dominates the space, controlling 95% of the GPUs used in data centers -- where much of AI processing is done -- according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. Furthermore, Nvidia is the gold standard for processing machine learning, an established branch of AI, with 95% of that market as well. This suggests it's a shoo-in as businesses and researchers alike begin to adopt generative AI.The results are undeniable. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue soared 265% year over year, while net income rose 769%.Thanks largely to the wealth of data on its social media platforms, Meta Platforms long enlisted the aid of AI to surface relevant content for users and inform its targeted advertising. However, the advent of generative AI helped take its advertising acumen to the next level, boosting its stock by 41% so far this year.Meta supplies a suite of advanced generative AI tools to advertisers, which helps make them -- and Meta -- more successful. For example, users can generate multiple backgrounds for a given ad, adjust the aspect ratio of an image, or revise text to better target a specific audience. The early results are impressive. Meta reports that marketers can save five or more hours per week, on average, because they can ""create multiple [ad] variations with the click of a button.""Furthermore, Meta created a leading AI model -- LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which can be found on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, helping Meta generate a brand new revenue stream.These factors helped boost Meta's financial results. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 25% year over year, while net income jumped 201%. While this was partially the result of easy comps, it also helps illustrate the strength of Meta's AI-driven digital advertising.When demand for generative AI increased last year, the popular narrative suggested that Amazon was late to join the AI race, giving competitors the upper hand.Despite that misconception, the company announced the debut of Bedrock, a service that provides all the top AI models to Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. They were joined by Titan, Amazon's own AI models, which were pre-trained on AWS. This allows its cloud users to streamline the process of generating custom AI systems. It also introduced Amazon Q, its generative AI-powered digital assistant.Most recently, Amazon upped the ante, adding to its already sizable investment in start-up Anthropic AI, bringing its total stake to $4 billion. The company said Claude 3 -- its latest model -- scored top marks on AI benchmark tests, outperforming Google's Gemini Ultra and OpenAI's GPT-4.For the fourth quarter, Amazon's net sales grew 14%, while net income surged 34-fold. While that's largely the result of easy comparable numbers, it also helps illustrate the strength of Amazon's industry-leading e-commerce and cloud infrastructure businesses, as well as its digital advertising segment -- all aided by its AI expertise. This has helped fuel stock price gains of 19% thus far in 2024.Microsoft arguably helped kick off the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI and the integration of generative AI capability into its suite of workplace productivity software. Like Amazon, Microsoft offers all the most popular AI models on its cloud infrastructure platform, Azure.The company's biggest opportunity, however, will be courtesy of Copilot, its generative AI assistant. The company created a growing roster of industry- and job-specific assistants to automate time-consuming and mundane tasks.Not only is Microsoft benefiting from the rapid adoption of Copilot, the company is also seeing a halo effect, with accelerating adoption of Azure Cloud, which grew faster than both AWS and Google Cloud in the calendar fourth quarter. The company noted that six percentage points of Azure's growth was the result of strong demand for AI.During its fiscal 2024 second quarter, Microsoft's revenue grew 18% year over year, while net income jumped 33%. Its stock price followed, up 12% so far this year.It's worth mentioning that the report suggested three of the Magnificent Seven stocks lagged the broader market -- Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet. However, as of this writing, while Tesla and Apple are down 33% and 12% respectively, Alphabet stock is up 11%, slightly better than the 9% gains of the S&P 500.Deliveries of Tesla's electric vehicles slowed by more than 8% over the last year, and sales of Apple iPhones are off as well. Both companies are struggling in China as competition in the country ramps up. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, which will no doubt weigh on the stock for the foreseeable future. Alphabet has its own legal troubles, as the Justice Department has taken issue with Google's search supremacy.From a valuation perspective, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are selling for 23 times, 25 times, and 26 times forward earnings, respectively, a discount to a price-to-earnings ratio of 28 for the S&P 500. At the same time, Amazon is selling for less than 3 times sales, so each of these stocks is relatively inexpensive.Investors with a long-term outlook would be best served by sticking to their investing game plan and ignore the calls for ""What have you done for me lately?""Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-03 08:15:00+00:00,2 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, chances are you're familiar with Warren Buffett. The investing mogul owns Berkshire Hathaway, one of the world's most successful holdings companies. Its success has seen it achieve a market cap of $909 billion, making it the world's eighth-most-valuable company and putting it in a similar league to some of the biggest tech giants.Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio posted a nearly-20% compound annual gain from 1965 to 2023, and is now worth $373 billion. Much of the company's growth is owed to the tech market, with at least 45% of its portfolio dedicated to tech stocks Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).Data by YChartsThese companies are home to potent brands and have delivered impressive gains over the last five years. While past growth isn't always an indication of what's to come, Amazon and Apple have exciting outlooks as they expand into budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR).These are two no-brainer Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.Amazon accounts for about 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, with its stake valued at $1.8 billion. The e-commerce leader has delivered stellar growth over the last few years despite market headwinds, proving its worth as a long-term investment.Amazon dominates e-commerce in dozens of countries, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2028. The tech company will likely continue profiting from the sector's tailwinds for years.However, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.Moreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to develop at a CAGR of 37% until at least 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.This chart shows Amazon's earnings could reach nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. When multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 43, you get a stock price of $300. From its current position, these projections would see Amazon's stock rise 67% by fiscal 2026, far exceeding the S&P 500's growth over the last two years.Amazon has a lucrative retail business and a promising outlook in AI, making it a Warren Buffett stock worth considering now. Apple is by far Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding, responsible for 42% of its portfolio. The company's 6% stake in the iPhone giant is worth more than $155 billion, and has delivered major gains over the years. In fact, since Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Apple in 2016, its stock has risen 552%.Apple is coming out of a tricky year. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30, 2023), and revenue dipped by 3%. However, the results from its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 31, 2023) showed signs that a recovery could be underway.During the quarter, Apple's net sales rose 2% year over year to $120 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion and breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Meanwhile, its earnings hit $2.18 per share, compared to an expected $2.10 per share.Additionally, the tech firm hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year, far more than many of its rivals. As a result, the company is well equipped to overcome current hurdles and keep investing in high-growth sectors. Recent challenges are why keeping a long-term perspective with proven growth stocks like Apple is crucial. The company has a highly lucrative digital services business, and is expanding into budding markets like AI and VR/AR, which should pull the company out of its slight slump and boost earnings long into the future.Moreover, Apple is trading at a bargain compared to its peers. It has the lowest forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow of any of the companies in the chart above.Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides a company's market cap by its free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics, as they take into account a company's financial health; the lower the figure, the better the value.Apple may have hit some roadblocks this year, but it has the cash to keep investing in its business and flourish over the long term. The company's stock is a no-brainer buy this month.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-03 07:50:00+00:00,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?,"Obviously, no investor owns a crystal ball. But let's face it -- one of the keys to successful investing is figuring out what the future holds for a particular company.That's easier to do with some companies than it is for others, of course. Take Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as an example. It's made the world's single-most-popular smartphone since unveiling the iPhone all the way back in 2007. Since then, the device has cultivated incredible loyalty to Apple's app-centric digital ecosystem. That's the big reason Apple stock has been so rewarding to loyal shareholders between then and now.As the old adage goes, though, nothing lasts forever. Will the next 15 years be as exciting as the past 15 have been? Probably not.The thing is, you won't have to wait the whole 15 years to see this. The company's already running into a headwind. As soon as three years from now, it should be clear that Apple's highest-growth days are in the rearview mirror.Don't misread the message. Apple is going to be fine. Indeed, it may well be an even bigger company by 2027 than the $2.6 trillion behemoth it is right now.On the flip side, don't be short-sighted. Sales of the iPhone alone account for roughly half of Apple's top line, but neither unit sales nor iPhone revenue itself have surpassed 2020/2021's peak.To this end, the company's overall top and bottom lines have been stagnant since then as well.There has been one bright spot of late, however. That's Apple's services arm. This business has continued to grow as more and more iPhone owners purchase more and more apps and other digital content through Apple. This is now the company's second-biggest business as measured by revenue, and while its gross profits are roughly half those driven by sales of physical products, services are still clearly an important part of Apple's total net income.The company is working on other profit centers in the meantime. Take artificial intelligence as an example. Although he's said little about AI, CEO Tim Cook has said he's looking forward to introducing something new on this front ""later this year.""What does that mean? That's just it -- nobody really knows. It's not a stretch to suggest, however, that it's going to be something that readily competes with Google's Gemini AI assistant and Microsoft's use of ChatGPT. It certainly wouldn't be Apple's first foray into the arena. The company introduced onboard assistant Siri all the way back in 2011 before artificial intelligence was capable of making such tech a truly useful tool.This shift away from iPhones and toward digital services won't be an easy one for Apple or its shareholders, though, for a handful of reasons. A highly competitive AI-assistant market is one of them.Microsoft is already using artificial intelligence technology as a draw to its Bing search engine, for instance, which obviously helps generate ad revenue. It's also helping private, paying users of ChatGPT technology to better monetize these AI-powered platforms. Ditto for Google's Gemini. It's just not clear how or even if these commercially minded features will be worth their cost in the increasingly competitive environment. The same applies to Apple's eventual entry into the space, which (given the underlying technology and consumer-facing business) is apt to be a more consumer-oriented than commercially oriented tool anyway.And that's an important distinction to draw out. Businesses are willing to pay for ways to make their apps more powerful. But consumers themselves? Not so much.There's also the not-so-small matter that consumers -- even loyal iPhone owners -- may not be interested in spending meaningfully more money on apps than they already are. Market research outfit Data.AI indicates that total consumer spending on (and in) apps was up a modest 3% last year, just barely reversing 2022's 2% (first-ever) decline in annual app spending. In a similar vein, last year's total number of app downloads rolled in at 257 billion, up less than 1% from 2022's tally. That's the lowest yearly growth rate yet, extending a long-standing streak of deceleration.This doesn't mean Apple's services growth is set to slow as much; it may not slow it all. This bigger-picture slowdown ultimately suggests that the app business's future isn't likely to remain as red-hot as its recent past has been, however. That will make it tougher on Apple, even if it remains the top name in the revenue-bearing app game.Fine, but what does any of this mean for Apple stock?Again, don't panic if you own it. Apple, at its worst, is still a better pick than plenty of other companies on their best days. The analyst community also believes Apple shares should be worth nearly $200 apiece a year from now, up more than 17% from their present price. Longer-term revenue and earnings forecasts also call for more growth after that, suggesting that shares could be worth even more than $200 further down the road.Even so, even the bullish analysts recognize that Apple is entering a new, slower-moving era and are collectively calling for modest single-digit sales and profit progress through 2026.The bottom line is that this is the first time since shortly after the first iPhone launched 17 years ago that Apple has had to fight so fiercely for so little growth.There's the rub: This isn't something investors are accustomed to seeing from Apple stock. That's the key reason the stock has underperformed since late 2021. And, since nothing looks like it's going to change anytime soon, don't be surprised to see Apple shares continue lagging for the next three years, either. It could struggle just to keep up with analysts' anemic targets. The only thing that might dramatically help is the launch of a game-changing product or service, like the iPhone, back in 2007. But there's nothing like that on the horizon.Then there's the bigger takeaway here. This is the kind of holistic, top-down thinking and analysis you should be doing for any prospective long-term pick.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Also, the company is working on updating the operating system to iOS 18 and integrating AI into its phones. A dip in quarterly sales doesn’t mean that the company is losing the market.

2024-04-02 19:00:00+00:00,Stock Stinkers: 3 Warren Buffett Holdings Disappointing Investors in 2024,"Through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), Warren Buffett controls a massive portfolio of stocks that is today worth more than $370 billion. The portfolio contains many large and successful positions, some of which Buffett has held for decades. However, the portfolio is not perfectly constructed and contains a fair number of stinkers. Some stocks have been long-term failures while others have recently taken a turn for the worse.Making matters more interesting is that Buffett’s portfolio is fairly narrow given its size and is highly concentrated in a few large bets. This can make the portfolio susceptible to a downturn in a big position. Yet, in his wisdom, Buffett always cautions investors against paying too much attention to short-term fluctuations in the stock market. Rather, says Buffett, investors should focus on gains achieved in a stock over the long term. Here are the stock stinkers in Warren Buffett’s portfolio.Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.comLet’s start with Warren Buffett’s largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). To say the position Berkshire Hathaway holds in AAPL stock is outsized would be an understatement. Currently, Berkshire owns 905.56 million shares of Apple stock worth $153.83 billion. A total of 41.5% of the holding company’s portfolio is comprised of AAPL stock. Berkshire Hathaway is Apple’s largest shareholder outside of mutual fund companies such as Vanguard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is to say that it’s very bad for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway that AAPL stock is down 8% on the year and badly trailing the market after more than a decade of outperformance. Today, Apple is one of the worst-performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The decline is being blamed on slowing sales of iPhones and other electronic devices, notably in China. An antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department isn’t helping either.While there’s hope that AAPL stock will bounce back, some analysts are pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s big holding of Apple shares as an example of the risks that come when investors are overly concentrated in one stock.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comEven worse than Apple has been the year-to-date performance of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Since the first trading session in January, CHTR stock has plunged 28%. What makes this holding of Warren Buffett’s particularly bad is that it has been a long-term stinker, down 20% over the past five years. Buffett’s stake is relatively small at 3.82 million shares worth $1.09 billion, comprising just 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. But by most metrics, this has been a losing investment.Buffett surely likes Charter Communications’ position as the biggest cable operator and largest pay TV provider in America. However, CHTR stock has been hurt by the company’s legacy Spectrum internet business unit, which continues to lose market share and money. In its most recent quarter, Charter reported losing 61,000 residential and small business internet customers. Consequently, the company’s profit amounted to $7.07 per share, which was nearly 20% below Wall Street forecasts.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOne of the absolute worst holdings of Warren Buffett is entertainment giant Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). The stock has performed so badly that it begs the question: why is Buffett still holding onto this stinker? So far in 2024, PARA stock has fallen 19%, bringing its 12-month decline to 47%. Over five years, the company’s share price is down 77%. The company is struggling under high debt levels, an unprofitable streaming service, and a strike by Hollywood actors and writers last year that hurt its production.Paramount Global has let it be known that it’s for sale and is willing to entertain offers. While a few rumors of a potential sale have surfaced, to date no deals have been formally announced, leaving PARA stock in limbo. It might be that Buffett is hanging on in hopes that a sale will be announced and the share price will rise. However, it’s hard to know what Buffett is thinking as he almost never discusses individual stocks in public. He did complain about Paramount Global cutting its dividend at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting.Currently, Berkshire Hathaway owns 63.32 million shares of PARA stock valued at $750.81 million, comprising 0.2% of the portfolio.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

2024-04-02 14:41:09+00:00,"Q1's big tech trends: The good, bad, and ugly","Gains in the tech sector during Q1 have been uneven, with powerhouses like Nvidia (NVDA) seeing its stock surge 80% on AI hype and with Tesla recording a nearly 30% drop on weakening EV demand. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to break down the good, bad, and ugly in the tech space.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoMADISON MILLS: Obviously, been quite a ride for tech, so far, this year from the high highs with the AI hype driving NVIDIA shares up over 80% to low lows like weakening EV demand, driving Tesla down almost 30%, and down in the premarket trade today, as well, 5%, at the moment here.We're going to go into the good, bad, and ugly of the tech sector in Q1 with our very own Dan Howley. Dan, a lot of movement in your beat always.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. It's a good time to write about tech always. And let's just go over some of the good stuff before we get into the bad, and then the ugly. The good-- kick things off, NVIDIA, obviously, had another whopper of a quarter. They had an announcement from their GTC event, where they launched their Blackwell GPU architecture.They saw year-to-date shares up 89%. Over the last 12 months, up 226%. We also had Intel. They got some of the money from the CHIPS Act, finally, $8.5 billion plus some loans in there, that they're able to take advantage of.We also saw Apple, in a good way, kill its electric car project. That was a decade in the making. Seemed to not really be going anywhere. This will allow them to focus more on AI, which is something that, according to Wall Street or according to, I guess, the perception they're severely lacking.And then, finally, we had Meta. They announced that they're going to be providing a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized additional share buybacks of $50 billion. That sent the stock skyrocketing 38% year-to-date, 131% over the last 12 months.Now, let's get to the fun stuff. This is the bad and the ugly. The bad-- let's kick things off with the FTC. They announced an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft over investments in AI with Anthropic and OpenAI. Obviously, the FTC trying to make sure that no one firm dominates the still nascent generative AI space.The Digital Markets Act over in the EU, that has the European Commission looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are actually complying with that law that basically ensures that big tech players don't dominate their markets.We also had Google with a terrible debut of their Gemini generative image software. The big image that went out there was a--JARED BLIKRE: Missed the mark.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. Missed the mark is what they said. Multicultural Nazis are not a good thing that you want to post on the internet. And that's what ended up happening with Gemini. And then, obviously, we have the TikTok ban that Congress is trying to get through.And then, finally, let's go over some of the very ugly stuff. The first is-- this is heinous. We have the DOJ's Antitrust fight against Apple, basically, saying that they try to block out competition, which harms consumers.We have Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI saying that they've abandoned their original mission for creating AI that benefits humanity in favor of profits. We have Intel, their earnings fell well short with really just blasted them as far as their share price goes.Generally, we've seen a lot of tech layoffs continue. And then this EV demand slowdown that we're seeing, where people just aren't taking up EVs as fast as anybody really thought that they would or wanted to. And so that's really hurting things. And we see that with Tesla coming in with their announcement.So look, it's been a wild quarter. I think that the main story, the main takeaway is still NVIDIA. They're the big leaders. But look, Apple getting play all over the place as they usually do in both the good and bad side.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And I've heard their own offerings competitors to OpenAI really gaining traction in the marketplace and also in some of these benchmark tests.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/q1s-big-tech-trends-good-144109918.html
2024-04-02 14:36:26+00:00,Apple Investors Seek Signs Worst Is Over After Quarterly Slump,"(Bloomberg) — With Apple Inc.’s stock coming off its poorest quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 Index in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.Most Read from BloombergA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger AheadTrump Media’s Business Doesn’t MatterIran Vows to Punish Israel Over Deadly Syria Embassy StrikeErdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal ElectionsCaribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU CrackdownThe 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say the stock is flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.“Nobody wants to sell anymore of their Apple positions because there’s a dividend, big share buybacks and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. “I don’t see the stock falling much further from here. The bigger risk is that Apple’s stock may be stuck in a range between $165 to $200 until it can decisively break above its longer-term moving averages.”The slide has erased more than $300 billion in market value this year, ceding Apple’s status as the most-valuable US company to Microsoft Corp. The drop was spurred by declining sales in China, regulatory scrutiny of its App store, and mounting concern among investors about its growth outlook.As the S&P 500 gained, Apple’s return lagged it by 21 percentage points in the first quarter, the worst showing by that measure since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.But the loss has been steep enough that it’s nearing a key support level at $165, the low it hit in October, when the broader market also bottomed out.Apple shares briefly traded for less than $170 at various points in recent sessions. Breaking below that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67. It ended Monday at $170.03.Short sellers pounced on Apple as peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. kept rallying. Apple is the second-most profitable short position this year at $2.4 billion in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners. That may give them some incentive to unwind the positions, and while the size of open short positions hasn’t changed much, they’re down from levels seen last year.With Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that tech shares may face pressure in the coming months — even with Nvidia’s dominance. The stock continues to set new lows relative to the $260 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. That suggests a momentum divergence has formed in the tech sector versus the broader market, with weakness emerging underneath the surface for growth shares.That said, Apple traditionally serves as a flight-to-safety trade due to its strong business model and cash generation. Despite challenges in China, Apple’s massive buyback plans mean its shares continue to have upside potential for long-term money managers, according to Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.While anxiety is building over how long the artificial intelligence euphoria can last following Nvidia’s over 80% surge in 2024, Apple shouldn’t be a drag on the S&P 500 unless it breaks its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.If other tech stocks stumble, Piper’s Johnson says it may even spur a rotation back into Apple.“If traders sell Nvidia, will they buy Apple instead? I hear it constantly from clients,” he said. “Investors love swapping one Magnificent Seven stock for another.”—With assistance from Elena Popina.(Updates with Tuesday trading for Apple)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-flirts-support-levels-worst-100001839.html

2024-04-02 12:00:00+00:00,AI ETFs: Q1 of 2024 Update,"The year 2023 was crucial in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry, characterized by dynamic company moves, groundbreaking initiatives, major product launches, substantial investments and strategic acquisitions. Companies like Google, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN launched major updates to their AI services, emphasizing improved performance, user experience and ethical AI practices.It all started with OpenAI releasing ChatGPT in late November 2022, Microsoft announcing huge investments in OpenAI in January 2023, Google launching Bard Chatbot in February 2023, Microsoft unveiling Bing Chat in Windows 11 and OpenAI continuing to lead the AI revolution with the launch of GPT-4 in March. Then, Google debuted AI-powered search and BARD in May 2023, Nvidia’s market cap hit the $1-trillion mark in late May 2023 on AI euphoria, which boosted the demand for chips.After that, things in the AI arena strengthened with Anthropic launching CLAUDE 2 in July 2023. OpenAI debuted GPT enterprise in late August 2023. Amazon bet on Anthropic in September. The Biden government signed an AI executive order in October 2023, Amazon announced the launch of its new chatbot – ""Q"" – in late November 2023 and Google unveiled its most effective Generative AI model, Gemini, in December 2023.A wider spread of AI among companies has been noticed. Amazon is on its way to shell out billions more to support an artificial intelligence startup as it eyes an edge in the new technology arms race.  The tech and cloud giant said Mar 27, 2024 that it would spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, adding to its initial $1.25 billion check.Apple (AAPL) is likely to use their own AI models, or lease them from Google for the upcoming AI features of the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. In China, reports suggest that Apple is likely to deploy Baidu’s AI models for all devices in the region. There are also news that Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone.Not only these, Apple announced this week that it will host its annual developers conference, WWDC, from June 10 through June 14, where Apple could reveal its long-awaited artificial intelligence strategy.

2024-04-02 10:15:00+00:00,2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,"Leading companies that are involved in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have already driven big gains for investors over the last year, but it's not too late for investors to capitalize. Almost every industry will eventually benefit from the increases in productivity that AI brings, and investors are just seeing a tiny bit of what this technology will do for businesses and consumers in the decades to come.Let's look at two leaders in semiconductors and consumer technology that are well positioned to benefit and reward shareholders.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been making chips for many years for video game consoles and personal computers. But AMD's data center business is starting to warm up after a sluggish year. It recently launched new graphics processing units (GPUs) designed for AI that could deliver significant growth.AMD is working with leading cloud customers, including Microsoft and Oracle, to deploy its new MI300 family of GPUs for AI workloads. Data center GPU revenue exceeded management's expectations of $400 million in the fourth quarter, and is expected to reach $3.5 billion for the full year in fiscal 2024 -- and will likely grow into a major business on its own in the years to come.Another growth catalyst for AMD is a recovering PC market. AMD's client segment, including sales of Ryzen processors, generated 21% of its revenue last year, but segment revenue fell last year with an industry-wide decline in PC shipments. Ryzen powers more than 90% of AI-based PCs, which puts AMD is in a great position to capitalize on growing demand as this technology gains more widespread adoption.The stock has already climbed 88% over the last year, but its valuation still leaves room for more upside. Data center GPUs generate high margins that can drive high earnings growth to deliver market-beating returns for investors.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) uses AI extensively across its products and iOS software. It is an essential technology that powers certain features in the camera, image recognition, and Siri services. While Apple is facing near-term headwinds with weak revenue in China and an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, the company's investments in AI position it well for long-term growth.The next iteration of the iPhone is rumored to include Apple's next-generation chips, which will boost performance for generative AI features. The iPhone 15 has seen solid growth in sales despite weakness in China, with revenue up 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. Management credited a record number of people upgrading for the increase. As Apple starts putting more AI features into these phones, it could drive an even stronger sales cycle.A generative-AI powered iPhone could let users ask Siri to summarize documents, for example, or complete other common tasks. It would also give Apple a great sales pitch for its more expensive iPhone Pro models, where these AI features would likely get implemented first. This could drive up average selling prices for iPhones and lead to strong earnings growth.Wall Street analysts currently expect Apple to grow earnings by 9% on an annualized basis, but strong demand for AI-enabled iPhones could lead to better growth than what's implied in the stock's valuation. At the least, the stock could slightly outperform the broader market over the next decade.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-02 10:12:00+00:00,"When You Look Back in 5 Years, You'll Wish You'd Bought This Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock","Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began as an online bookseller when it was founded in 1994. E-commerce remains the company's largest source of revenue, but it has also expanded into other areas of the technology sector, including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).AI could be one of the greatest financial opportunities in history, and Amazon is tackling it from multiple angles. The company just made the final payment of its agreed $4 billion investment into leading AI start-up Anthropic, a deal that will accelerate Amazon's progress on both the hardware and software sides.Amazon is one of six companies valued at $1 trillion or more, and all of its peers have a presence in AI. However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch. Here's why investors might regret not buying it when they look back on this moment in five years.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services platform in the world. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI.The hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads.However, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.But some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI.Ready-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making.In September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.Anthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code.Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider.Microsoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race.Amazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).Nevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2.As the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google).Amazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation.However, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030.Therefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential. As it grows to become a larger contributor to Amazon's overall revenue, it will make the entire organization more profitable. When investors look back on this moment in a handful of years, they might be glad they bought Amazon stock at its current valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-02 10:00:01+00:00,Apple Flirts With Support Levels After Worst Quarter in a Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- With Apple Inc.’s stock coming off its poorest quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 Index in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.Most Read from BloombergA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger AheadTrump Media’s Business Doesn’t MatterErdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal ElectionsCaribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU CrackdownTrump Pays $175 Million Bond to Avert Asset SeizureThe 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say it’s flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the stock’s lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.“Nobody wants to sell anymore of their Apple positions because there’s a dividend, big share buybacks and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. “I don’t see the stock falling much further from here. The bigger risk is that Apple’s stock may be stuck in a range between $165 to $200 until it can decisively break above its longer-term moving averages.”Read more: Apple Without AI Looks More Like Coca-Cola Than High-Growth TechThe slide has erased more than $300 billion in market value this year, ceding Apple’s status as the most-valuable US company to Microsoft Corp. The drop was spurred by declining sales in China, regulatory scrutiny of its App store, and mounting concern among investors about its growth outlook.As the S&P 500 gained, Apple’s return lagged it by 21 percentage points in the first quarter, the worst showing by that measure since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.But the loss has been steep enough that it’s nearing a key support level at $165, the low it hit in October, when the broader market also bottomed out.Apple shares briefly traded for less than $170 at various points in recent sessions. Breaking below that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67. It ended Monday at $170.03.Short sellers pounced on Apple as peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. kept rallying. Apple is the second-most profitable short position this year at $2.4 billion in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners. That may give them some incentive to unwind the positions, and while the size of open short positions hasn’t changed much, they’re down from levels seen last year.With Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that tech shares may face pressure in the coming months — even with Nvidia’s dominance. The stock continues to set new lows relative to the $260 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. That suggests a momentum divergence has formed in the tech sector versus the broader market, with weakness emerging underneath the surface for growth shares.That said, Apple traditionally serves as a flight-to-safety trade due to its strong business model and cash generation. Despite challenges in China, Apple’s massive buyback plans mean its shares continue to have upside potential for long-term money managers, according to Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.While anxiety is building over how long the artificial intelligence euphoria can last following Nvidia’s over 80% surge in 2024, Apple shouldn’t be a drag on the S&P 500 unless it breaks its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.If other tech stocks stumble, Piper’s Johnson says it may even spur a rotation back into Apple.“If traders sell Nvidia, will they buy Apple instead? I hear it constantly from clients,” he said. “Investors love swapping one Magnificent Seven stock for another.”--With assistance from Elena Popina.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-flirts-support-levels-worst-100001839.html
2024-04-02 09:45:00+00:00,Apple's Lack of iPhone Innovation Is Becoming a Big Problem,"It wasn't long ago that smartphone users had plenty of reasons to upgrade after two years. Smartphones were getting significantly better each year. Snappier processors, more vibrant screens, and greatly improved cameras whetted consumers' appetites for new phones.Today, innovation in the smartphone industry is tougher to find. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 15 family looks and performs an awful lot like its predecessor. For those with much older iPhones, an upgrade may make sense. But most people who upgraded within the past few years aren't missing much by skipping this generation.While one month doesn't make a trend, February was a rough month for Apple's most important business. According to UBS, iPhone sales in the U.S. dropped 9% year over year, sales in China were down 16%, and sales in India were down 13%. There was solid growth in Europe, but overall sales were down 4% worldwide. UBS expects Apple to sell 51 million iPhones in the first calendar quarter, down from 56 million last year.UBS cited a few reasons for the decline. In China, fierce competition from Huawei and other domestic competitors is proving to be a stiff challenge. In the U.S., the popularity of Samsung's recent Galaxy smartphones and weak carrier upgrade rates are hurting iPhone sales.There could be multiple drivers behind the decline in carrier upgrade rates. One driver is probably that new smartphones just aren't very exciting anymore. With Apple churning out incremental upgrades year after year, it may be getting tough to sell consumers on its latest devices.Higher interest rates may also be a factor. Wireless carriers often offer incentives such as cheap financing or big discounts on new smartphones. Now that prevailing interest rates are no longer at historic lows, providing cheap financing has become a more expensive proposition.The interests of wireless carriers and Apple also aren't quite lined up. Carriers use smartphone incentives to help pluck customers from their rivals, but ultimately, the goal is retaining wireless subscribers, not selling phones. While a lower upgrade rate is a major problem for Apple, it's only a minor problem for wireless carriers.Apple appears to have missed the generative AI boat. The company is reportedly in talks with Alphabet's Google to use the Gemini AI model to power iPhone AI features, a sign that the company is nowhere close to developing something similar on its own.The jury is still out on whether generative AI models run locally on smartphones will prove to be a game-changer. If it is, Apple is probably going to be playing from behind.Recent antitrust developments raise the risks for Apple's most important products. The U.S. Justice Department is suing Apple on charges of monopolizing the smartphone market, with one of the key sticking points being the company's efforts to make it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone.If Apple is forced to make changes that lower switching costs for consumers, the cost of its slowing rate of innovation and its AI subservience could be amplified. Companies tend to become more risk-averse as they grow larger, and Apple is the largest of them all.One thing that we can be absolutely sure of is that the iPhone will eventually be disrupted. Given Apple's strategy of incremental upgrades and its AI missteps, I'm willing to bet that whatever ultimately disrupts the iPhone won't be coming from Cupertino.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-02 09:06:00+00:00,Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now,"Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.By the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).Over the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.Nvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.But there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.For example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.Nvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.The chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are ""Magnificent Seven"" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.Here are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.The first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.The reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.Google Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.Like Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.However, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys.Even though social media company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.Meta's ""secret sauce"" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.The other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match.A fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!One of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the ""Oracle of Omaha's"" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.Warren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.The fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa (NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.What makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.Visa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-01 21:43:47+00:00,The Best Case Scenarios for the Magnificent 7 Stocks in 2024,"It’s no secret that the Magnificent 7 stocks have performed exceptionally well throughout 2023 and into 2024.  In this article we’re going to look at the best case scenarios for those equities. Before getting into those best case scenarios let’s take a look at just how important they’ve become.In 2023 The Magnificent 7 pulled the S&P 500 up by 24%. One tripled in value, another doubled, and the worst performers grew by nearly 60%. Their collective 106% return was phenomenal. It was so impressive that one head of research dubbed the remaining stocks within the S&P 500 the ‘Meager 493’ noting their relative lack of contribution.That strong performance begs a question: just how much higher can the Magnificent 7 rise? No one knows exactly how high but it’s certain that artificial intelligence (AI) will be the defining factorInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) trudged through 2023 always a step behind the other stocks within the Magnificent 7. Microsoft charged out of the gate with its strong investments in OpenAI and ChatGPT integration into its Bing search tool.Alphabet seemed to be caught flat footed in that regard. It’s been playing catch up ever since. Alphabet released its chatbot, Bard, which it later renamed Gemini. The service wasn’t particularly well regarded and its Large Language Model (LLM) has been updated twice. That’s a 10,000 foot view of Alphabet’s position today.Fundamentally, the company represents a mixed bag. Sales have grown for four straight quarters with revenues increasing by 13% in the most recent quarter. That’s a strong signal to the markets. However, the $65.5 billion in ad revenues during the most recent quarter fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.Analysts believe Alphabet can run 20% higher in 2024. In order for that best case scenario to materialize Google will have to improve the perception of its AI prowess.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comMake no mistake about it, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is full of potential in 2024. Current estimates suggest that Apple can return 50% this year. Like all other shares discussed here, AI will be fundamental to its success.That said, Apple is currently facing more trouble than it has at any point in the recent past. In 2024 the stock has already faced multiple negative revisions that have knocked $25 off its share price since late January. Those negative revisions have resulted in what is known as compression whereby ratios and multiples shrink. As bad as that sounds, there are reasons for bullishness moving forward.iPhone sales are integral to the success of Apple. Apple will update its operating system to iOS 18 later this year. It is expected to be full of AI updates that could spike demand for the newest iPhone models. Look out for announcements regarding that at the company’s developer conference in June. Announcements there will have the potential to send shares much higher.Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock can move higher in 2024 due to AI. Shares currently trade for $180 and are pegged at a high of $230. In order for share prices to reach that point Amazon’s AI investments will need to show returns.Amazon just invested an additional $2.75 billion into the AI startup Anthropic. That brings its total investment in the company to $4 billion, its largest investment in another company. Amazon is a minority owner in the upstart. Google also invested $2 billion in Anthropic. In turn, Anthropic will spend $4 billion on Amazon’s Cloud platform over the next 5 years.Meanwhile, Amazon is also planning to spend $150 billion on data centers in the coming 10 years in order to better capture AI demand. It’s clear that Amazon is keen to maintain its dominant position within the cloud sector. Amazon’s investment in Server Farms is much greater than that of its rivals. That’s a great reason to believe Amazon will continue to thrive in the long run. Overall, 2024 is looking brighter as the company ramps up its AI intentions.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) became a dividend stock in 2024. The early February announcement was a boon to the company, spiking market capitalization by $205 billion.The company delivered that news as part of an earnings report that was also very strong. The combination of those two pieces of good news were a blessing and a curse at the same time. The problem is that META shares will have trouble moving higher in the future. Analysts on Wall Street suggest that shares could move above $600 this year. They currently trade for $485.Meta Platforms is fueled almost entirely by ad revenues. In order for it to move 20% higher the company’s investments in AI will have to filter through and increase ad revenue substantially. Further, in order for ad spend to rise firms will need to be confident of the direction of the economy. My best guess is that the number one factor there is expectations around rate cuts. Signs of earlier cuts will build very well for Meta.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comThe best case scenario for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in 2024 is that it rises from $420 to $600. In order to do so Microsoft will have to overcome some of its current challenges, especially as they relate to AI prompt outputs.In recent weeks concerns over the safety of outputs from ChatGPT have emerged. A Microsoft engineer warned that co-pilot creates content that can influence political bias, fuel underage drinking, incite religious attacks, and further conspiracy theories. Microsoft is essentially countering that those so-called malevolent uses were never part of its original intent.The company recently unveiled tools that are intended to prevent users from tricking AI chatbots into those malevolent uses.Otherwise, Microsoft continues to do it very well on a fundamental basis. Its most recent earnings report shows impressive growth overall, at 18%. Microsoft’s cloud revenues are particularly strong, having grown by 24%. Microsoft will have to overcome those safety concerns mentioned above. However, the bigger hurdle will be continuing to prove that enterprises are willing to pay for its AI tools. That will be the primary determinant of Microsoft’s ability to break the $600 threshold in 2024.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comMost investors are aware that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is projected to rise as high as $1,400 in 2024. That’s roughly 50% higher than its current $900 share price.In order for Nvidia to do so it will have to continue to provide stellar results. Revenues grew by 126% in fiscal year 2024. That overall growth is impressive but it’s also the trajectory of growth which is noteworthy. In the first quarter Nvidia reported $7 billion in revenues. By Q4 that had more than tripled to $22 billion. Of that $22 billion, $18.4 billion was attributable to data center revenue.The reason to believe that Nvidia will continue to provide stellar results lies in its H200 chips. Initial shipments of those chips are expected in the second quarter. As long as widespread AI adoption continues Nvidia should continue to thrive as well. It has few competitors that have shown any real ability to displace it.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is essentially going through a worst case scenario at the moment. The stock remains weak due to softness in the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) market. The company will announce delivery data which will confirm weakness. It’s not likely that Tesla shares will rebound anytime soon.Tesla has offered pricing discounts in China to combat weak demand. Meanwhile, it has increased prices on the same vehicles in the United States and Europe. Tesla is again looking to increase margins that fell in 2023. However, analysts believe that those increased prices are not reflective of higher demand in American and European markets. Those analysts therefore believe that those price increases will not help to improve Tesla fundamentally.U.S. deliveries are expected to increase by 4% in Q1. Deliveries in the U.S. make up roughly 40% of Tesla’s business. Meanwhile, in China, deliveries are expected to decline by 23%. The Chinese market makes up roughly 30% of volume. It’s clear that Tesla’s best case scenario is predicated upon a strengthening Chinese economy.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-04-01 20:30:00+00:00,Earnings Overreaction: 3 Stocks Ready to Rally When Investors Realize Their Mistake,"Earnings season can bring out the best and worst in investors. The penchant for overreacting to both earnings and forward guidance is the reason it’s often called the “silly season” on Wall Street. Some stocks rise 30% while others plunge 20% based on one quarter’s worth of data and an outlook that is, at best, for the next 12-months. Lost in the near hysterical overreactions can be nuance and efforts by management to provide context for their earnings and guidance.Warren Buffett, arguably the most famous long-term investor of all-time, famously encourages people to ignore short-term earnings and Wall Street pundits, and focus instead on the fundamentals of a business and a company’s long-term prospects. This is sound advice as earnings overreactions often lead to poor buy and sell decisions that investors could come to regret. Here is earnings overreaction: three stocks ready to rally when investors realize their mistake.Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell 1% after the microchip and semiconductor company issued strong fourth quarter 2023 results that beat Wall Street targets, and the shares have traded sideways since the print was delivered in early March. Analysts say AVGO stock has gotten knocked lower because the company’s forward guidance failed to impress. But the shares are also being punished because Broadcom’s growth was not as impressive as rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBroadcom reported earnings per share (EPS) of $10.99, beating Wall Street estimates of $10.40 a share. Revenue totaled $11.96 billion, which topped estimates of $11.80 billion. The company was conservative and reiterated its previous full-year revenue guidance of $50 billion, which is inline with Wall Street forecasts. However, analysts apparently wanted to see more from the company and have moved away from AVGO stock.It likely won’t be long until the bulls rediscover AVGO stock. After all, Broadcom’s management team has been pounding the table on the fact that they continue to see strong demand for their chips in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.Source: lentamart / ShutterstockExecutives at sports apparel company Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) have been clear that they’re focusing on international expansion. The company’s latest financial results proved that the international growth strategy is exceeding expectations. So why did everyone choose to focus instead on the fact that North American sales have slowed and basically toss LULU stock down an open elevator shaft, sending the shares down 16%?Lululemon’s Q4 2023 financial results beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. International sales in 2023 grew an astounding 54% year-over-year, with sales in the critical market of China up 78% from 2022 levels. While it is true that sales in North America slowed, they were still up nearly 10% year-over-year. The company’s full year guidance was basically in line with Wall Street forecasts.Not only have investors overlooked the huge international sales growth at Lululemon, but they’re also not factoring in that the company is expanding its sales further by pushing into men’s athletic apparel and sneakers, a huge potential market for the company. LULU stock is down 23% on the year. Buy the dip.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comYes, iPhone sales are slowing. But that’s no reason to toss the baby out with the bath water, which is what looks to be happening with Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. So far in 2024, AAPL stock is down 8% and one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 index. Most of the decline can be attributed to a slowdown in sales of the iPhone. However, almost all of that slowdown is occurring in China. And a new market forecast sees smartphone sales rising this year and names Apple as a top beneficiary of the growth.According to Counterpoint Research, smartphone shipments worldwide should rise 3% this year as declining inflation, demand recovery, and AI features attract buyers. The premium segment of smartphones priced between $600 and $799 is expected to grow 17% this year. Counterpoint says that Apple is likely to emerge as the winner in the premium smartphone market worldwide, and adds that growing demand for iPhones in emerging markets should also benefit Apple.There are media reports say that Apple is in talks to build the Gemini AI engine into its iPhones, a move that could increase demand for the devices. Investors should also remember that Apple continues to surpass Wall Street’s earnings forecasts and that the company’s services business is offsetting declines in sales of its consumer electronics.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AAPL.

2024-04-01 20:23:26+00:00,Tech stocks: The three 'horses' to bet on in tightening AI race,"In the year's transition from the first quarter to the second quarter, is 2024 shaping up to be another breakout year for tech as far as AI catalysts are concerned? Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Yahoo Finance in-studio to talk about tech stock leaders with broadening use cases for artificial intelligence, highlighting Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL)""You have to play a basket. You're not going to be able to pick a single horse in this AI race and work out as well as it did for Nvidia (NVDA) last year,"" Basenese says. ""Let's just face it, Nvidia can't have the same run... this year as it did last year. It just would become too big of a company.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.- Let's talk more about Google, the Magnificent Seven, the AI idea here. Let's bring in Lou Basenese, whose Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist. So you just heard what we were talking about here about where we are in this opportunity. And it feels very fits and starts still.LOU BASENESE: Agreed.- So how should investors be thinking?LOU BASENESE: We should be able to just put it into ChatGPT and get the answers, right.? I mean, that would be that simple. But--- Well, except ChatGPT makes some mistakes, which is the whole problem.LOU BASENESE: And I think that's what last year was the year of Nvidia and the launch of the big AI wave. And this year has got to be about first derivative opportunities. Where do we do? Where are the tools and applications where AI really changes things for business, for consumers, in the medical field. And I think you're just starting to see some of those applications come out.From the software side, I agree that you have to play a basket. You're not going to be able to plaque a single horse in this race and work out as well as it did for Nvidia last year. I mean, let's just be, let's just face it. Nvidia can't have the same run last year, I mean, this year as it did last year. It's just would become too big of a company.I love Microsoft. Personal disclosures, I don't have any, we don't do any investment banking with them. But what I love about Microsoft is they can drive AI adoption by pushing it down into their products. Whereas Nvidia is really looking to get pulled into the market by people that are developing applications that need their chips. So I think they have a little bit more leverage there than most players would give them credit for.- We actually just had Dan Ives on Wedbush on the show. His survey work was talking about very bullish, bullish on Microsoft too. It was talking about at least his checks indicate more adoption of Copilot there. What about Apple, by the way? We were just talking about it. I mean, it's down about 12% this year. And you can understand the sentiment there, Lou, because it's questions about the AI strategy, it's China, it's being targeted by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. But what are your thoughts on that?LOU BASENESE: Yeah. I mean, look, I'm an unabashed Apple fan boy, have been for a long time. But you probably remember too, we go through these waves of sentiment changes, and usually the bearish sentiment peaks during this time of the year. It's just the next iPhone upgrade cycle is not going to be as strong, average selling prices aren't, and then we get a surprise, right. Services revenue boost a lot higher than we expected. Their install base is bigger, so therefore--- How many times you've heard the death knell for Apple.LOU BASENESE: I mean, all the time, right? It's innovate or die. And I've always said, it's just iterate and thrive. Because they have such a big install base that if they have incremental improvements to margin, to product offerings, it really adds up to the bottom line, because they're always buying back shares to boost the profitability. So look, I'm always the contrarian. If we had the yearbook adage there I would be the most likely to be contrarian. I like Apple when everyone else hates Apple, and I don't think it's anywhere close to being rotten right now.- OK. So let's ask then about Alphabet and the mixed sentiment that we've seen over their launch of their AI products. I mean, there have been a lot of questions, and that's been very volatile also.LOU BASENESE: And I think if you look at them in cloud services, right? They're the third horse in the race, right. They had great growth last quarter, about 26% growth for their cloud services. But it was only about $9 billion, which puts them 2 and 1/2 times behind Microsoft, and well behind Amazon. But I do like Alphabet because they're really an economy plan, advertising economy plan. And if we look at the underlying strength in the economy, it's really good.So that should boost their ad business. Which I think if you look at the valuation, Alphabet is selling at the cheapest valuation out of the Magnificent Seven. I mean, about 22 times forward earnings. That's, if you want to, I think earlier in the show you're talking about valuations getting stretched with the previous guest in the tech space, in particular. This is the undervalued name in tech, for sure. I won't go near Tesla, I don't. Yeah.- Why you wouldn't go near Tesla?LOU BASENESE: No, I just think it's too volatile. And I think, Elon Musk has always been a great promoter and visionary to say here's what's next. I don't know what's next right now, right. Ai.- I think himself he said we're between growth waves.LOU BASENESE: Yes, and I think, that's accurate, right. You get credit and the most valuation on the early phases of that growth wave. It's the S curve of innovation and they're looking for that next gen.- And you don't think, Lou, though I mean, the way the stock has been hammered this year, you think, you don't think all the bad news is priced in?LOU BASENESE: I think no, because I think the bad news is more to come not just for Tesla but for the whole EV industry. I think there's just a reckoning of the economics. And I think investors are trying to figure out where does that sort out.- All right. Lou, thanks for your time today.LOU BASENESE: Thank you.- I appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/tech-stocks-three-horses-bet-202326655.html

And that iPhone demand is too soft. So more not so great news for Apple, Julie.So cruel Loup Capital they do cut down to 170. I think the money line is here. IPhone unit shipments, they say are simply too soft owing to both organic demand, but also competition.For the first time in years, they say Apple is experiencing flattening iPhone ASPs meaning. Average selling prices. Firm is still at a neutral on that name.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I bolded those two sentiments as well from the note. And in particular, they talk about the competition from China. In particular, what's going on there with Huawei, and that those phones are really gaining more traction. And that is the issue they say.They also ask could iPhone average selling prices and mix capacity growth be peaking right now, which I think is a really intriguing concept because Apple, yes, of course, the iPhone number of units has been growing. But what really has set them apart is the margins that they collect because of the price of the phones.JOSH LIPTON: Margins have held in there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And if the prices are not going to go much higher, then that is potentially going to be a problem.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, stocks are down about 12% so far this year.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/loop-capital-cuts-apples-price-195419042.html

2024-04-01 18:10:00+00:00,1 Magnificent S&P Dividend Stock Down 12% to Buy and Hold Forever,"When it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.Apple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year.Apple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.Apple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.Now that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.Here are three reasons for optimism:Consumer strengthServicesReturn of capital.While iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.Another reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below.Services include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.Apple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.Apple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by ""bridging the physical and digital space."" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-01 12:00:54+00:00,Biden DOJ takes aim at Apple even though consumers love it,"Apparently, nothing irritates the Biden administration more than a successful business. Apple is the latest target of the Justice Department’s ongoing crackdown on what they say are high-tech monopolies.The DOJ has already filed actions against Amazon, Google and Meta platforms. This time they, along with 15 state attorneys general and Washington D.C., allege in a suit filed in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey that Apple’s policies hurt consumers and competitors. They contend the company deliberately makes it harder for users to switch to non-Apple devices and prevents competitors from offering alternatives to its services, such as digital wallets. The allegations concern not only smartphones but also web browsers, advertising services and more.DOJ SUES APPLE IN ANTITRUST CASE, ALLEGING ILLEGAL SMARTPHONE MARKET MONOPOLYApple fiercely denies the charges and vows it will ""vigorously defend"" against them. And a lot of people think they have solid ground to stand on.For one thing, Apple’s iPhone has just 57% of the U.S. smartphone market. Globally, it’s only about 20%. That’s hardly a monopoly. Android serves 41% of U.S. phone users, which clearly indicates that people who prefer not to use Apple’s devices are able to easily find an alternative product. Again, that does not fit the definition of a monopoly.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPWhat the DOJ, politicized by President Joe Biden’s campaign strategy to ""go after"" Big Tech, fails to realize that people choose to use iPhones, or buy other Apple merchandise, simply because they like them.Apple is one of America’s favorite companies. It doesn’t sell a lot of phones by forcing them on consumers, it simply makes a good product.Apple has been one of the world’s great innovators for almost 50 years. Started in a California garage in the 1970s, Apple now holds 95,500 patents and continues to file thousands of new ones each year. Putting the government in charge of how Apple designs and develops its products would put the brakes on one of the strongest economic engines in the U.S. economy.Talking to CNBC, an Apple spokesperson said: ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.""CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSThat’s a pretty legitimate argument. It indeed would be a dangerous precedent to weaponize the DOJ to bring down a U.S. company that meets the needs of consumers, employs thousands of workers and generates significant tax revenues at every level of government. Why would the government want to do that?The intensely competitive tech market, where companies continually work to develop better products, services and technologies, is much more capable than the Biden administration of deciding Apple’s future.

2024-04-01 09:50:00+00:00,"Here's the Best ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street","""April showers bring May flowers."" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.You might not think the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.We can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.For example, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.It's a similar story for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.Wall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.That leaves the ""A team"" as the top contenders: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.Amazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.Google parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.Perhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.Apple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.I'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.The conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.But Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI because of its ""incredible breakthrough potential."" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.It's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the ""wow"" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-01 07:05:00+00:00,"Warren Buffett Has $157 Billion Invested in These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks","Warren Buffett doesn't typically invest in high-flying growth stocks building cutting-edge technology. ""Berkshire is not big on newcomers,"" he jokes in his most recent annual letter to shareholders. Nonetheless, he's invested a huge portion of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio in two artificial intelligence (AI) giants, both of whom are members of the vaunted Magnificent Seven.The Magnificent Seven is a group of megacap companies whose stocks have largely driven the performance of the S&P 500 since the start of 2023. They're mostly technology leaders and not the typical Buffett investment. But if Buffett sees value in these two stocks, they can likely produce strong returns for investors regardless of whether they lean more toward Buffett's investment style or more toward growth stocks.Here are the two Magnificent Seven AI stocks Buffett has sunk $158 billion into.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown to become Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by a wide margin. Buffett initially started accumulating shares of Apple between 2016 and 2018. And with the phenomenal growth of the stock since then, Berkshire's position has ballooned to a value of about $155 billion today.While Buffett has trimmed his Apple position a few times in the past, it appears to be for tax purposes more than anything. In fact, Buffett expressed regret over selling shares given a tax opportunity in the past, but he seemed to repeat the same mistake at the end of last year.Given the size of Berkshire's position in Apple, no one should question Buffett's belief in the company and the stock to produce strong results going forward. Buffett called Apple ""a better business than any we own,"" at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting last year.So, what does Buffett like so much about Apple?While Apple builds various technologies, including artificial intelligence, Buffett sees it as an unparalleled consumer products company. There's no consumer product more ubiquitous than the smartphone, and Apple's share of the smartphone market, especially the premium smartphone market, is unmatched.Apple has capitalized on that position in more recent years by expanding its ecosystem and building a large services business. The iPhone has become a platform business, in a sense, which has helped Apple produce expanding profit margins. Services, as a group, generate nearly twice the profit per dollar as Apple's hardware sales.Buffett is also a fan of Apple's massive capital return program. He notes that every year Berkshire's stake in Apple increases a little bit because Apple buys back so much of its shares. The company produces around $100 billion in free cash flow annually, and it returns practically all of that to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As a result, shareholders, including Berkshire Hathaway, can claim a bigger stake in Apple's earnings every year.Apple shares trade for a forward P/E multiple of 26, a slight premium to the S&P 500. But that premium is justified by its big cash position and share buyback program.The other member of the Magnificent Seven found in Berkshire's portfolio is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Amazon is far from a Buffett stock. He even said the business is outside his circle of competence in an interview several years ago, so he doesn't consider missing the boat on the stock a mistake. Nonetheless, his company owns about $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock.That's likely due to one of Buffett's partner portfolio managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, initiating a position in 2019.There's a lot to like about Amazon. ""It's changed your behavior, everybody's behaviors,"" Buffett said of the company back in 2017. Indeed, the Amazon Prime network has become a significant moat for the business, pushing shoppers and merchants to become more loyal to Amazon. That creates a flywheel whereby Amazon can invest more into Prime benefits and faster shipping, drawing in more shoppers and more merchants.Buffett is also impressed by Amazon's cloud-computing business, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's operating income. That could grow quickly with the growth of artificial intelligence, and Amazon is investing heavily to keep up with competitors in the space. That includes a $4 billion investment in Anthropic and designing its own AI training and inference chips for its servers to support new large language models and AI-powered applications.The fast growth of Amazon's cloud-computing business along with its burgeoning advertising sales should support continued margin expansion for the company, producing strong free-cash-flow growth -- the main metric by which management judges its financial results.Amazon trades for a price-to-sales ratio of just 3.29, which sits below its five-year average despite increasingly promising prospects of margin expansion.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 17:17:00+00:00,Forget Apple: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now,"For years, Apple has been the top dog. But, as they say, the times are a-changin'.iPhones are old news. Unit sales of the devices have leveled off after years of growth. What's more, the company is now embroiled in an antitrust case with the U.S. Department of Justice that could last years and cost millions -- or billions -- in legal costs and fines.The time may finally be here for investors to look elsewhere for outperformance. Let's have a look at two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could be suitable portfolio replacements for Apple.First up is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). In the decades-old battle between Microsoft and Apple, Microsoft has taken the upper hand in recent months as its market cap has once again surpassed its rival.In part, that's down to Microsoft's competitive advantages in the field of AI. The company has several AI initiatives that are already bearing fruit.Microsoft is leaning into the AI chatbot craze with its Copilot assistant. With its ability to generate images, compose emails, code, and shop, Microsoft is hoping Copilot can become many people's ""everyday AI companion."" The company's close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI puts Microsoft on the front lines of AI innovation. One year ago, after ChatGPT took the world by storm, Microsoft integrated some ChatGPT features into its Office software suite -- quickly capitalizing on the buzz.Finally, thanks to Microsoft's large cloud services business, the company should expect to benefit from the growth of the overall AI market. As AI start-ups look to scale their models, they will turn to Microsoft -- which, as the No. 2 cloud services provider, controls many of the high-performance computers needed to run the latest and greatest AI models.Microsoft has several ways to win as the AI revolution rolls on. Accordingly, it may be time for investors to load up on Microsoft and leave Apple behind.Yes, it's true: Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is up more than 800% in a year.However, that incredible outperformance shouldn't scare off long-term investors. Here's why: Super Micro Computer's overall business model is straightforward. The company makes the physical hardware that holds and cools the enormously complex -- and expensive -- graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most complex AI models.In other words, Super Micro Computer is rolling like an ice cream shop in the middle of a heatwave.Granted, that boom won't last forever. However, it could last a lot longer than many think. That's because the overall GPU market is expected to grow 10 times from 2022 through 2032. What's more, those estimates might actually be too conservative. Some industry insiders think the market might grow from $40 billion to $400 billion by 2027, not 2032.Either way, there is an avalanche of demand for high-powered GPUs, and consequently, for the server racks to house them.That's why analysts expect Super Micro Computer's total sales to skyrocket from $7.1 billion to $14.6 billion this year. By 2025, Wall Street expects sales to surpass $20.7 billion.For long-term investors looking for a growth stock with serious legs, Super Micro Computer is a name to consider.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.But the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.In the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ’s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company’s overall business. But that wouldn’t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.It could ultimately hurt the company’s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft’s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives’ resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.The tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.Nvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it’s implementing generative AI to one degree or another.Apple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That’s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.But antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives’ time, pulling them away from important business decisions.“If the company believes that virtual reality is the next generation of computing after the smartphone … they really need to focus at the C-suite on that,” explained Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. “But this case is enough to really substitute their time away from focusing on the future. So that's one risk.”There’s some precedent for this line of thinking. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates famously blamed the distraction caused by his company’s antitrust battle with the DOJ for its failure to break into, and capture, the smartphone market. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2001, opening up Windows to competing web browsers and services.Microsoft eventually launched its own Windows Phone, even going as far as acquiring Nokia for $7.2 billion, but it failed to catch on and the company decided to focus on its cloud business instead.Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster says that while he doesn’t believe the antitrust case will prove to be a major distraction for Apple’s ability to innovate, it’s certainly a threat.“If [Apple doesn’t] innovate then they're going to lose and it's not about the DOJ; the DOJ would have been the distraction factor,” he told Yahoo Finance.A protracted legal battle could also damage Apple’s carefully crafted public image.“The question is, how far and how hard is Apple [going to] fight some of this stuff, and in the process, do they risk … hurting the tremendous goodwill that they have?” said TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “I think that's something that they need to think about.”Apple has built up a powerful following around the world thanks to its top-notch hardware quality, easy-to-use software, and customer service. But a lengthy legal fight and negative headlines could jeopardize that.Yes, Apple is one of the world’s largest electronics companies with a growing services business. And sure, the iPhone is one of the most iconic devices ever built, but consumer sentiment can change overnight, and that could certainly prove problematic for Apple.The DOJ’s antitrust suit is still in its earliest stages, and Apple is sure to fight it as aggressively as possible. And while it’s weathered major storms before, including regulatory fights in the European Union, there’s no guarantee the company will come away from this battle unscathed.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

2024-03-31 12:00:00+00:00,Spring Cleaning: 3 Stocks to Say Goodbye to Right Now,"Spring is here, and flowers are blooming. You know what that means: Time for a good old-fashioned round of spring cleaning.With that in mind, here are three stocks that a panel of Motley Fool contributors are ready to say goodbye to this spring.Jake Lerch (Apple): Now, don't get me wrong, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed a great run. It's the second-largest public company in the world for a reason, and I don't think its stock price is about to collapse.Yet however impressive its past performance, what matters to investors is how the company will perform going forward. And that's where I have concerns for Apple.To start with, sales of the company's signature product -- the iPhone -- appear to have leveled off after years of growth. In 2023, Apple sold 231 million iPhones -- virtually identical to the number it sold in 2015. Moreover, iPhone revenue appears to have gone flat. The figure last year was $201 billion. That's down from $205 billion in 2022.YeariPhone Unit SalesiPhone Revenue2015231.2 million$155 billion2016211.8 million$136.8 billion2017216.7 million$141.2 billion2018217.7 million$166.2 billion2019187.2 million$142.3 billion2020196.9 million$137.3 billion2021242 million$191.9 billion2022232.2 million$205.4 billion2023231.3 million$200.5 billionBut what about Apple services? Won't the company's growing software division lead to its next phase of growth?Perhaps. Apple's services segment does now account for almost 20% of the company's total revenue. However, software has never been Apple's bread and butter. Indeed, its long-standing policy of bundling its software and hardware has dampened its growth -- dating all the way back to the 1980s, when the company wouldn't license the Mac operating system to other computer makers. What's more, the real question is whether Apple can compete over the long term with companies that have created iconic software, social media, and web apps -- Microsoft (Windows and Office), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms (Facebook), and Amazon (Amazon.com).Finally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) raises another question for Apple: What happens to the smartphone business as the use of AI systems keeps expanding? Will anyone want to pay $1,000-plus for a smartphone if everything from TVs to cars to wearables to thermostats is enabled with AI-powered features?In short, Apple is at a crossroads. And while I certainly wouldn't bet against the company, I do think investors can find many alternatives with fewer question marks right now -- think Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. And that's why Apple is on my spring cleaning list.Will Healy (C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) looks like a stock to buy rather than avoid. Given the popularity of generative AI stocks in recent months and the enterprise software company's ability to attract high-profile clients such as the U.S. Army and Baker Hughes, it seems like it should be on a long-term uptrend.However, upon closer inspection, investors will see serious issues. Though it is successfully attracting enterprise AI clients, the company's strategy appears excessively tied to tech trends. It went by names such as C3 Energy and C3 IoT before it went public in 2020. Those frequent name changes may make investors wonder how committed the company is to its focus on AI.Secondly, based on its finances, there's some question about whether it can ever become profitable. For the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, C3.ai reported revenue of $224 million, up 15% versus the same period in fiscal 2023. (Its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 31.)Unfortunately, its operating expenses (which do not include its $127 million cost of revenue for the period) amounted to $363 million. Consequently, its net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 came to $207 million.Worse, C3.ai is not showing any signs it can grow its way out of this problem. For fiscal 2024, it forecasts revenue between $306 million and $310 million, which would amount to a 15% increase at the midpoint.As a result, the stock has struggled. It had more than doubled in value at one point last year before a dramatic pullback. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 10%, significantly lagging the S&P 500.Furthermore, it trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11. That multiple arguably makes C3.ai an expensive stock, particularly considering its financial struggles.Ultimately, investors have numerous choices when it comes to investing in AI. Given the state of its finances, investors should probably consider selling C3.ai and putting their money into a faster-growing AI company that's on a path to sustained profitability.Justin Pope (Super Micro Computer): I've been bullish about Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) in the past, and I still like the company over the long term. But Super Micro Computer has risen too high, too fast this year. Shares are more than 1,000% above their 52-week low -- a level of return that the broader market would likely take decades to produce.If you're sitting on a multibagger today, considering selling some of your stake would be wise. That doesn't mean there isn't much to like about Supermicro. Its modular server systems are in high demand due to the booming investments in artificial intelligence across the technology sector. The company's growth has accelerated to a triple-digit percentage rate, and management believes revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year in the next quarter.But stocks can be volatile, and the broader market has been running hot. The Nasdaq Composite index is up a smoldering 38% over the past year. Eventually, a pullback could pour cold water on share prices, and investors may start locking in some profits from their big winners. Has any stock run as high as Super Micro Computer? It would be hard to find one that has.I'm not saying you should sell everything and run for the hills. However, greed can be a powerful emotion that works against investors. If you're sitting on huge gains, consider taking some profits. You can always look to reinvest when the market inevitably cools off.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 09:59:00+00:00,"Here's How Much Dividend Income You'd Make by Investing $70,000 in the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks","You don't buy growth stocks primarily to receive income. Many of these stocks don't pay dividends at all. However, that doesn't mean you can't earn dividend income from growth stocks.The biggest growth stocks on the planet right now are the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Can you count on sitting back and having dividends pour in with these stocks? Yes -- at least with some of them. Here's how much dividend income you'd make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks.There's a clear ""dividend divide"" among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Although they all arguably make enough money to pay dividends, only four actually do so.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) initiated its dividend program in 2003. Since then, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) technically began paying quarterly dividends decades ago. However, the company ended its dividend program in 1995 and didn't resume distributing dividends until 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple has consistently increased its dividend payout.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most surprising dividend stock in the Magnificent Seven. The big chipmaker first declared a quarterly dividend in 2012. Nvidia increased its dividend regularly for several years but has maintained a steady payout since late 2019.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the newest Magnificent Seven dividend payer. The social media company initiated its dividend program earlier in 2024.Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla don't currently offer dividends. That could change in the future for two of the three, though. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that Amazon and Alphabet could begin paying dividends, perhaps as soon as this year.So how much dividend income could you make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks? If you bought $10,000 of each stock, the total would be just under $170. The following table breaks down how much in dividends each stock would contribute:StockDividend YieldAnnual Dividend IncomeMicrosoft0.71%$71.00Apple0.56%$56.00Meta Platforms0.41%$41.00Nvidia0.018%$1.80AmazonN/A$0.00AlphabetN/A$0.00TeslaN/A$0.00Total$169.80Data source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.Of course, if you were truly seeking dividend income you probably wouldn't buy shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. Let's crunch the numbers assuming you invested $70,000 split equally across the four dividend payers in the Magnificent Seven ($17,500 in each stock). The following table shows how much you'd make:StockDividend YieldAnnual Dividend IncomeMicrosoft0.71%$124.25Apple0.56%$98.00Meta Platforms0.41%$71.75Nvidia0.018%$3.15Total$297.15Data source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.Would most income investors be happy with an annual dividend income of less than $300 from an initial investment of $70,000? Probably not.The magnificence of the Magnificent Seven stocks is limited. None of them offer attractive dividends. The best dividend payer in the group, Microsoft, still has a dividend yield of barely over half of the yield of the S&P 500.Dividends are an afterthought if you're investing in the Magnificent Seven. Buy these stocks for their growth prospects. Many other stocks are more magnificent if you want solid dividend income.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 09:20:00+00:00,Is It Safe to Buy Stocks With the S&P 500 at a Record High? Warren Buffett's Advice Could Save Investors From Costly Mistakes,"The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 31% over the past year as investors became more confident in a soft landing, a scenario in which the Federal Reserve successfully tames inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. The index currently sits within a percentage point of its record high, but upward momentum has stretched valuations across the stock market.The S&P 500 currently trades at 20.9 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the five-year average of 19 times forward earnings, and a substantial premium to the 10-year average of 17.7 times forward earnings. Not surprisingly, some analysts on Wall Street think stocks are due for a correction. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have set the S&P 500 with year-end targets of 4,200 and 4,500, respectively, implying a downside of 19% and 14% from its current level.Those forecasts leave investors with a tough decision. Is it safe to buy stocks with the S&P 500 near its record high? Or is the stock market best avoided until valuations come down? Anyone looking for answers might want to take their cue from Warren Buffett.CEO Warren Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) equity securities portfolio, while deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handle the remainder. Investors can track the stocks the trio buys and sells each quarter by reviewing the Form 13Fs the company files with the SEC.The latest filing indicates that Berkshire sold several stocks during the fourth quarter. The company closed its positions in Markel, Globe Life, D.R. Horton, and StoneCo, substantially reduced its positions in Paramount Global and HP, and trimmed its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, Berkshire also bought stocks during the fourth quarter. The company added to its positions in Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Chevron.Collectively, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks last year. The company reported more than $40 billion in equity securities sales compared to just $16 billion in purchases. That marks a turnaround from the previous year when Berkshire reported $33 billion in equity securities sales and $68 billion in purchases.In short, Buffett and his deputies continued to buy stocks throughout 2023 despite rising valuations, but they also moved more cautiously. Investors should follow that example.Over the years, Warren Buffett has dropped bits of investing advice like breadcrumbs during interviews, editorials, and shareholder letters. In synthesizing that information, the prevalent theme is that Buffett likes to buy understandable businesses that benefit from a durable economic moat, but only when shares trade at attractive prices relative to intrinsic value.Economic moats come in different shapes and sizes, but they generally amount to pricing power or cost advantages. For instance, Apple derives pricing power from the brand authority it has built with consumers. Nvidia has pricing power in the superior nature of its artificial intelligence chips. And Visa benefits from cost advantages arising from the size of its payments network. However, an economic moat alone does not qualify a business as a good investment. Investors must also consider its valuation.Buffett once explained the concept of intrinsic value by quoting economist John Burr Williams: ""The value of any stock, bond, or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows -- discounted at an appropriate interest rate -- that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset."" That quote refers to discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts future earnings back to their present value to estimate what a company is worth.The discounted cash flow (DCF) formula looks intimidating on paper. But online calculators can crunch the numbers, so investors only need to familiarize themselves with the inputs. Learning by example is the best strategy. Shown below is a DCF calculation for Apple using this calculator.Current value: The trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) or free cash flow (FCF) per share. I used earnings per share of $6.42 over the last 12 months.Discount rate: The return required to make the investment worthwhile. I used the historical return of the S&P 500, which is approximately 10% annually. Some investors prefer the weighted average cost of capital.Growth rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate over a defined period of time. I used the consensus forecast among Wall Street analysts, which says Apple will grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years.Growth over: The length of time the growth rate will persist. As mentioned, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years.Terminal rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate after the explicit forecast period. This number should align with inflation, but should not exceed gross domestic product growth. Investors typically select a value between 2% and 4%, so I split the difference with 3%.Terminal rate over: The length of time the terminal rate will persist. Investors often assume terminal growth will continue indefinitely, but I used 50 years.Based on those inputs, Apple is currently worth $115 per share. That means the stock is about 32% overvalued at its current price of $169 per share. However, investors should remember DCF models involve guesswork, and even small changes to the inputs can have a drastic impact on the output.To summarize, the S&P 500 moved much higher over the past year, and the index currently trades at a material premium to its historical valuation. Even so, Buffett continued to buy stocks throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. But he also showed more caution compared to the previous year, indicating that worthwhile investments were harder to find.In that context, investors can safely purchase stocks in the current market, provided they show similar caution. That means avoiding costly mistakes driven by fear of missing out, and instead limiting purchases to competitively advantaged businesses trading at reasonable valuations.Should you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 08:44:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Has $159 Billion Invested in These 8 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,"Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was ""extraordinary."" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't ""know if it's beneficial.""Whatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.That could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.Berkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.Amazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.Is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding ""yes."" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.Microsoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.Buffett also owns shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.Broadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.AI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.Through NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.Qualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.Berkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM (NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.IBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.Buffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.Alphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.I think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 08:15:00+00:00,Will ASML Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both often considered bellwethers of the tech sector. ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Apple is the world's second-most-valuable company and top smartphone maker.But over the past 12 months, ASML's stock rallied 50% as Apple's shares rose just 6%. Investors were impressed by ASML's dominance of the lithography market, which makes it possible for leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture their most advanced chips. Yet they were less pleased with Apple's slowing iPhone sales and recent regulatory troubles.ASML's market cap of $390 billion is still a lot lower than Apple's valuation of $2.6 trillion. But could ASML follow Nvidia's lead and become a multitrillion-dollar chip company by the end of the decade? Let's see if ASML has more room to run -- and whether it can actually eclipse Apple over the next six years.ASML, which is based in the Netherlands, is the leading producer of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems and the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems. DUV systems are used to manufacture older and larger chips, while EUV systems are required for the production of world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades. That long development process, along with the fact that its EUV systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, shut its competitors out of the market.The world's most advanced foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all currently use ASML's EUV systems to produce their highest-end chips for fabless chipmakers like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.ASML's current EUV systems can be used to manufacture chips as small as the 2-nanometer node, but its next generation of high-NA EUV systems will enable chipmakers to produce sub-2nm chips over the next few years. That generational leap should enable ASML to further strengthen its monopoly in the high-end lithography market.ASML's dominance of that crucial technology enables it to generate steady growth and maintain high gross margins even as the broader semiconductor sector goes through cyclical booms and busts. Here's how it fared over the past six years.Metric201820192020202120222023Revenue growth22%8%18%33%14%30%Gross margin46%44.7%48.6%52.7%50.5%51.3%EPS growth27%1%38%69%(2%)41%Data source: ASML.However, the importance of ASML's lithography systems has also made it a top target for export curbs in the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. ASML expects the latest restrictions on its system sales to China, along with the broader macro headwinds for the semiconductor sector, to cause its sales growth to nearly flatline in 2024. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 1% for the year as its earnings dip 3%.But looking further ahead, ASML sees its expansion accelerating significantly in 2025 as the macro environment improves, it laps the export curbs in China, and ramps up shipments of EUV and high-NA EUV systems. The ongoing process race between TSMC, Samsung, and Intel to manufacture the world's smallest chips should continue to drive that growth.During ASML's last investor day presentation in November 2022, the company predicted it could generate 44 billion euros ($48 billion) to 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in revenue by 2030. Those estimates, which are based on expectations for the semiconductor industry, would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to 12% from 2023. If its valuation holds steady and it hits the top end of that range, ASML's stock price could roughly double by the end of the decade.However, ASML's market cap would only reach about $780 billion if its stock price doubled. It wouldn't join the trillion-dollar club or come anywhere close to matching Apple's valuation.Even if Apple's iPhone sales stay sluggish and antitrust regulators continue to challenge its walled garden policies, the tech giant's market cap probably won't slip back below the $1 trillion mark by 2030. Instead, the worst-case scenario for Apple might merely be becoming a slow-growth tech company that relies more heavily on big buybacks than innovative products to drive its earnings growth.Even if ASML doesn't come anywhere close to matching Apple's market cap, it could remain the better overall investment. ASML is better diversified, serves an essential role in the booming semiconductor industry, and has much clearer plans for the future.Should you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 07:50:00+00:00,"Are Nike, Lululemon, Apple, Tesla, and Starbucks Waving a Red Flag for the Stock Market?","So far, the stock market is having a great 2024, at least when measured by the performance of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up over 9.5% year to date. However, if you dig a little deeper, you see that there is a divergence forming.Here's why the S&P 500 could keep going up despite this challenge, and how these changing market dynamics could impact your portfolio.There are plenty of ways to categorize companies. You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap. But one often overlooked difference between companies is whether they mainly sell to consumers or businesses. For example, Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both big tech stocks. But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.Some -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.The industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.Many companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has brought the cost of its cars down, but there are still more affordable options. And Apple charges top dollar for its devices.All five of these companies are instantly recognizable brands and industry leaders. But all five stocks have been struggling. Starbucks and Nike are within 5% of their 52-week lows. And all five companies have lost considerable value in 2024 compared to strong gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.Despite being in different industries, the challenges of these companies are actually quite similar.Nike has been cutting inventory so it is less exposed to slowing consumer demand. Lululemon delivered blowout results, but guidance was light due to a challenging consumer environment that includes concerns about the economy and diverting spending toward services and experiences over goods. Since reporting earnings on March 21, Nike stock is down over 8% and Lululemon is down over 19%.Starbucks has exhibited impressive pricing power that has offset inflationary impacts and has led to record sales. But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.Apple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China.Tesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model. Earnings are projected to be lower in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months, signaling that Telsa is in store for negative growth over the short term.Different sectors tend to outperform or underperform the S&P 500 based on the business cycle, valuation, investor sentiment, and other factors. What makes 2024 unique is that many sectors are doing well, but there are major industry-leading companies that tell a completely different story.The broader market can keep going up even if consumer-facing companies remain challenged, because businesses are doing well and could accelerate growth if interest rates fall later in the year.In most cases, if an industry leader is underperforming it's because it has high exposure to consumer spending and/or China. The investment thesis for Apple, Tesla, Nike, Lululemon, and Starbucks hasn't really changed. Instead, all five stocks are underperforming because these companies don't have the qualities that are driving the widespread rally (artificial intelligence and rising corporate profits from business-to-business sales).Investors who think consumers and China will recover over time are getting the chance to buy many great companies on sale. Just be ready for more volatility, and the risk that the narrative could get worse before it gets better.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-31 04:59:19+00:00,10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US,"In this article, we will look at the 10 industries with the highest number of quits in the US. We have also discussed the great resignation and turnover expectations for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US. The Great Resignation, characterized by a massive increase in job quits, appears to be drawing to a close, marking the end of a tumultuous period in the workforce. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of workers have left their jobs, with astonishing numbers quitting in 2021 and 2022. Anthony Klotz, who coined the term 'Great Resignation,' notes that resignation rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels according to May 2023 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicating a normalization of the job market.Economists attribute the decline in resignations to various factors, including economic instability and improved working conditions. The current economic uncertainty has made workers more cautious about quitting, leading to a slowdown in resignation rates. Additionally, many individuals who made significant career changes during the pandemic have settled into new roles, contributing to the decline in quits. Job satisfaction is reportedly at its highest level in nearly four decades, reflecting improved workplace conditions and employer efforts to retain talent.Despite the overall decline in resignations, certain industries continue to experience high turnover rates, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and construction. While economists declare the Great Resignation officially over, they acknowledge that certain sectors may still struggle to find and retain workers.  Currently, healthcare and hospitality are two of the industries in the US that have the biggest labor shortages.It is also interesting to note that employers are bracing for increased turnover in the first half of 2024, as revealed by a recent study from Eagle Hill, signaling a potential increase in departures due to faltering confidence in leadership and overall workplace satisfaction. The survey was conducted nationally and pointed to a nearly 6-point decline in worker confidence regarding organizational stability and leadership, coupled with a 2.7-point drop in satisfaction with cultural elements such as connection and recognition. Despite these concerning trends, there's a glimmer of hope as workers exhibit confidence in pay-related matters, with perceptions of compensation and future growth expectations rebounding by 2.5 points in the last quarter.Moreover, as highlighted by iCIMS’ 2024 Workforce Report, 51% of surveyed individuals contemplate job changes, primarily driven by salary aspirations. Concurrently, 60% anticipate promotions, with 50% intending to seek new opportunities if promotions elude them. Such data confirms a shift towards prioritizing personal fulfillment over traditional work commitments. Employers are urged to capitalize on internal mobility, evidenced by a 13% decrease in external hires compared to the previous year, signaling opportunities for career growth within organizations.Despite the optimism displayed by 87% of employees regarding job security, driven perhaps by economic stabilization, workforce strategies demand agility. HR leaders must nurture employee engagement through skill development initiatives, vital for retention and internal advancement. To read more about job security, see 22 Careers with the Best Job Security.With an aim to impart education and skills, in 2018, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) introduced a groundbreaking education benefit, offering $1-a-day tuition for approximately 30 college degrees. Fast forward to today, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is drastically reducing its degree offerings from 30 to just eight, while expanding short-form certificate programs to over 50 options. The revamped program aims to equip employees with in-demand skills like generative AI and data-driven decision making. By doing so, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to fill around 100,000 jobs within the next three years, focusing on roles such as software engineering and pharmacy technicians. While some may perceive the reduction in degree options as a limitation, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) focuses on the benefits of short-term certificate programs. These programs typically take four months to complete, offering a quicker path to career advancement compared to the six to eight years typically required for a college degree. One of the companies with the lowest turnover rates in the world is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, the company is strategically expanding its Vision Pro VR headset beyond the US, with recent job listings in countries like Australia, China, and Japan hinting at an imminent global launch. Initially released solely in the US for $3,499, the Vision Pro's international rollout has been eagerly anticipated. Job postings seeking ""Briefing Experience Specialists"" in these markets signify  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s intention to introduce the device to a broader audience.  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s meticulous approach to ensuring a seamless customer experience, especially concerning fitting and prescription lenses, underpinned its initial US-only release. However, the ongoing language expansion and job listings suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s readiness to cater to a global audience. While specific release dates remain undisclosed, these developments strongly suggest that the Vision Pro's reach will extend beyond US shores soon.A construction site featuring a large concrete foundation poured by the cement manufacturing company.To list the industries with the highest number of quits in the US, we relied on seasonally adjusted data on quit rates by industry from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of January 2024. The list is presented in ascending order. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Quits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%In addition to volatile energy prices affecting the oil and natural gas drilling sector, the mining and logging industry in the US is facing high resignation rates due to several factors. One significant reason is increased concerns over workplace safety and environmental sustainability, prompting workers to seek alternative employment in less hazardous or more environmentally conscious sectors. Moreover, technological advancements and automation are reducing the demand for manual labor in these industries, leading to job insecurity and prompting workers to explore new career paths. To read more about the dangers involved with jobs in this industry, see the most dangerous jobs in the world.Quits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%Manufacturing is one of the top industries with the highest number of quits in the US. Let’s look at some of the reasons why the resignation rate in the industry is high. The nature of manufacturing work often involves physically demanding tasks, long hours, and repetitive duties, leading to dissatisfaction among workers. Secondly, wages in the manufacturing industry may not always be competitive compared to other sectors, prompting employees to seek higher-paying opportunities elsewhere. Thirdly, limited opportunities for career and professional growth can discourage employees from staying long-term. Quits Rate as of January 2024: 1.7%The high quit rate in the information industry, especially among technologists, is driven by the rapid evolution of technology that necessitates continuous skill updates, prompting professionals to seek new roles offering better growth prospects. Moreover, intense competition fosters job mobility as individuals pursue higher pay and improved conditions.Additionally, the widespread adoption of remote work expands the range of potential employers, granting technologists greater flexibility. These dynamics create an environment where professionals actively explore and capitalize on available opportunities, leading to the industry's increased quit rate.Quits Rate as of January 2024: 1.8%Construction is one of the industries that need the most workers. In the US, the industry is facing major challenges, notably a shortage of skilled workers impacting project costs and timelines. Reports suggest over half a million positions need filling, including roles like heavy equipment operators, carpenters, and electricians. This deficit is worsened by factors such as the Great Resignation and a lack of young recruits. Construction companies are exploring solutions like training programs and technology integration. To read more about shortages, see 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.Quits Rate as of January 2024: 1.9%The manufacturing industry faces several major challenges in its workforce, reflected in alarming statistics. High turnover rates, averaging 39.9% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pose a persistent obstacle. Such turnover not only disrupts production but also results in substantial financial losses due to the need for frequent retraining. Moreover, the sector struggles with a critical shortage of skilled workers, with Deloitte projecting over two million unfilled manufacturing jobs by 2025. This scarcity threatens the industry's growth potential, potentially resulting in a $1 trillion loss to the US economy by 2030. Click here to see the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US.Suggested Articles:Top 20 Fastest Growing Industries in the Next 5 Years: Predictions15 Fast-Growing Industries Looking To Hire in the USTop 19 Industries That Are Hiring Right NowDisclosure: None. 10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.

2024-03-31 03:29:35+00:00,20 Best Personal Finance Podcasts in 2024,"In this article, we will take a look at the 20 best personal finance podcasts in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Personal Finance Podcasts in 2024.Personal finance is the management of financial resources and decisions made by individuals to meet their financial goals and needs. Financial literacy empowers individuals to effectively budget, save, invest, and plan for their future, leading to financial stability, security, and independence. Financial illiteracy on the other hand can seriously cost a person in various ways including debt accumulation, poor financial decisions, and limited earning potential. According to a survey conducted by the National Financial Educators Council, in 2023, financial illiteracy, on average, costs Americans $1,506 per person. The results, if generalized, imply a loss of $388 billion in 2023 because of a lack of proper financial education. A similar survey in 2022 showed that an average respondent lost $1,819 due to lack of financial knowledge. This cost is bound to accumulate over time and hold back the individual from achieving their financial goals.Learning about personal finance is becoming increasingly popular as people want to make smarter financial decisions. Media is playing a vital role in spreading knowledge about personal finance. Popular news sources including Forbes and CNBC have dedicated personal finance categories aiming to help readers build their skills. By learning about personal finance, individuals can target the right investment opportunities as well. Furthermore, there are YouTube channels and podcasts on personal finance readily available. Online sources on personal finance including podcasts follow an episode or chapter format, discussing one personal finance topic at a time. They also discuss the basics of investing and savings. You can also check out the 20 Best Investing Podcasts for Beginners on Spotify.Buying stocks is becoming a popular choice among Americans looking to invest or learn about investing. According to a survey conducted by Gallup, 61% of Americans reported that they owned stocks in 2023. The number of people investing in stocks is surging, as it was 56% in 2021 and 55% in 2020. One of the best beginner-friendly investments is blue-chip stocks i.e. companies with stable business models, established operations, and a track record of profitability. Some of the best examples of blue chip stocks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

As of March 28, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has surged nearly 33.24% over the past six months. Here are some comments from Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Q2 2024 earnings call:""We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency.

2024-03-31 01:14:00+00:00,"Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allow Nvidia to Crush Apple and Microsoft, and Become the Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock?","Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.In the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.With incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.These gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.Could Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?Starting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.As businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.In last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion.Nvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.But the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least.Apple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.For comparison, Microsoft  grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.If demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.Right now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 21:55:58+00:00,"Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches from Apple to Tesla challenger as its first EV racks up 120,000 orders in 36 hours","Anyone who’s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it’s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?On Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun—a household name in China—said at the presentation in Beijing: ""Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn't it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?""The entrant of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk’s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla’s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk’s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China’s Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world’s top EV seller.Of course, Tesla has already proven itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.""In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. ""Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.""In February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was “shocked” by the decision. He's cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.Xiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.Lei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.Lei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, ""Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.”Time will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the competitive EV market or if it should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.""The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.But Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year’s production capacity is sold out.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/smartphone-maker-xiaomi-switches-apple-215558015.html
2024-03-30 19:52:19+00:00,11 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Right Now,"In this article, we will take a look at the 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Right Now.The S&P 500 Index, widely regarded as the leading index for large-cap equities listed on United States stock exchanges, is up nearly 10.8% year-to-date and 29.7% during the past twelve months. The rally, that started in late October, is supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve’s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. The optimism has been further bolstered by the dovish outlook presented by the Federal Reserve in its latest meeting conducted earlier this month which maintained its view of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.To recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023.Even though several megacap stocks, including several “Magnificent Seven” stocks that played a significant role in the bull run during the latter half of 2023, have continued to perform well, some of the megacap stocks have hit a snag and are in the red in terms of year-to-date performance. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), sitting in the middle of our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, has gone down nearly 11% year-to-date as the company faces pressure from antitrust regulators and demand concerns in China.Another magnificent seven component, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is also facing pressure as its stock has plummeted nearly 29.2% year-to-date based on electric vehicle demand concerns.In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), one of the biggest fast food chains in the world, is facing demand destruction across its overseas operations as it faces boycott campaigns in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict in the middle east as well as macroeconomic pressure in China.Another stock that has made it onto our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now is the leading aircraft maker, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which has been a part of news headlines for the wrong reasons. In January, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, operated by Alaska Airlines took off from Portland, Oregon and had to make an emergency landing as a piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the jet. There are more than 200 aircraft of the same category that have been delivered by the company. The safety crisis led to significant criticism and ultimately resulted in major shake ups in the top leadership of the company.A close up shot of a stock ticker reflecting the performance of Indian equity markets. MethodologyTo create our list of 11 oversold blue chip stocks to buy right now, we compiled a list of stocks with more than $50.0 billion in market capitalization with the lowest 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI).The Relative Strength Index is a technical indicator that tracks momentum changes in stock prices. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it is calculated by determining the mean of gains and losses of a stock in the last 14 days. An RSI above 70 implies that a stock is overbought and below 30 implies that it is oversold. These levels can be adjusted if needed. The stocks in this article are listed in descending order of their RSI.Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

2024-03-30 13:45:00+00:00,"Should You Buy This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Despite Regulatory Headwinds?","The ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of highly acclaimed tech companies, have had very different fortunes this year. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the worst-performing of the bunch, only outdone by Tesla among its peers in this rather unenviable category.Investors haven't been thrilled with Apple's financial results, but the company just ran into another significant regulatory headwind that won't make it more popular on the street. Let's look into whether or not investors should give up on Apple stock.Apple and other members of the Magnificent Seven have been under scrutiny for years for alleged antitrust practices. These tech giants have achieved their success, so the argument goes, partly by unlawfully stifling the competition and making customers worse off than they otherwise would have been. On March 21, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by no less than 16 states, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of maintaining an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market.Apple has done so in various ways, according to the lawsuit. For example, communication (including texting and sending pictures) between iPhones and other smartphone brands isn't nearly as smooth as between iPhone users. Apple's App Store also comes with unreasonable fees for app developers, not to mention that the tech giant has suppressed innovation on its platform, the suit also claims. Those are just some of the allegations brought forth by the DOJ going after Apple's most important moneymaker: the iPhone.It's too early to know the outcome of this lawsuit. It could drag on for years. Thankfully, Apple has the funds to handle this kind of litigation. The company generates tens of billions in free cash flow. Plus, the tech giant is not new to fierce legal battles although this might be one of the most important it has faced in its long and storied history.So what should investors do? In the parlance of Wall Street, I'd assign Apple stock a ""hold"" rating for now. That is, though I wouldn't advise investors to sell off their shares, I'd also be cautious about increasing one's position following the dip. The reason for this approach goes beyond Apple's recent legal troubles. In addition, the tech giant seems to be trailing several of its peers in the next massive growth industry: artificial intelligence (AI).Apple is rumored to be planning several moves. And given the company's reputation, that of taking existing technology, transforming it into an even better version, and being massively successful at it, Apple is still in the race. It's impossible to ignore the company's brilliantly innovative track record. But as of now, the company's direction in the AI market remains somewhat unclear.Meanwhile, the iPhone, though still its biggest source of sales, is no longer the growth driver it once was, not even close. Though its services segment is growing in importance and boasts incredible margins, it still makes up a relatively small percentage of Apple's total revenue. Apple has an installed base of more than 2 billion devices, but depending on the outcome of the DOJ's lawsuit, its ability to monetize its ecosystem could change drastically.The combination of these headwinds is why Apple isn't a screaming buy on the dip right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 12:30:00+00:00,"3 Magnificent Stocks That I'm ""Never"" Selling","When I buy a stock, I try to remind myself that I am buying a small part of a business and that I intend to hold my stocks for the long term. Warren Buffett famously said that his favorite holding period is forever. While that's aspirational more than anything, it's an important reminder that success in investing comes from identifying great businesses and then letting them compound over decades.While some stocks in my portfolio have a lot more to prove to stay there forever, there are some that I can't imagine myself selling. These businesses have long track records and competitive advantages that should pave the way for bright futures. As the saying goes, ""Never say never."" Yet with these stocks, I'm as close to never selling as one can be.Every time I am struggling to find parking or waiting in the long (but efficient) line to check out, I ask myself why I don't own more Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) stock. While most of my fellow shoppers are likely not having the same thought, we're all there to take advantage of the bulk quantities and low prices. History tells us that this business model has been wildly successful with Costco shares gaining more than 81,000% since its IPO.Costco ended its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended February 2024) as the third-largest global retailer and the 12th-largest company in the Fortune 500, with 874 locations worldwide. Its membership model works well. More than 92% of Costco members renew their membership and the company brought in nearly $5 billion in membership fees in the past 12 months.The low prices keep customers coming in the door, and because Costco sells fewer items than its competitors and turns its inventory over very quickly, it can sometimes even sell items before they need to be paid for. This helps cash flows and reduces expenses.If there's a retailer that comes first to mind for me other than Costco, it has to be Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). I don't think I am alone in finding myself shopping there before almost anywhere else. Over the trailing 12 months, Amazon stock is up 82%. However, during the market slump of 2022, the company fell nearly 50% as it struggled to get its finances back in order following the massive distribution build-out necessitated by the pandemic surge in orders.Amazon is certainly back on track and ready to reaccelerate its growth. In 2023, Amazon grew revenue by 12% but the more impressive results were further down the income statement. Operating income increased by 202% and net income grew by 1,226%. These results were driven by a recovery in the e-commerce business, which finally turned the corner after its 2022 struggles. It's also worth remembering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in cloud infrastructure and it grew its revenue by 13% in 2023.Consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Finding itself increasingly under the microscope of federal antitrust investigations, the stock has fallen 12% over the past three months. This news is certainly worth watching, but it will take years to play out and the rather modest decline in Apple's share price suggests the market's level of concern is less severe than some of the headlines indicate.Taking a step back, it's important to remember that Apple is still a ubiquitous brand around the world, and especially within the United States. Known for its iPhone and other consumer electronic devices, Apple is slowly becoming a software company. Apple now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices.This creates an ecosystem of apps and subscription services that provide a high-margin income stream for the company. In the most recently reported quarter, services revenue (which is where all the subscription products are reported) grew by 11% to $23 billion. This represents 19% of total revenue, up from 18% in the year prior.Are there scenarios in which I might sell these companies? Sure, anything is possible. However, these three businesses are so competitively advantaged and are still growing so impressively at their large scale, that it's difficult to envision a scenario where they wouldn't warrant a spot in my portfolio. Investing can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. In my mind, buying and owning these three stocks is about as simple as investing can be.Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 11:15:00+00:00,"Better ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock: Apple or Tesla?","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have delivered outstanding returns to investors in recent years, and they continue to outperform. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 19% year to date, beating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 9.6%.But not all seven stocks are up this year. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 12% and 27%, respectively. Nonetheless, they have tremendous brand power in their respective markets, and neither will stay down forever. So now is a good time to compare their growth potential to see which offers more upside from here.Apple stock rose 43% over the last three years, but it has been weighed down by market share losses for the iPhone in China. The nation generates 21% of Apple's operating profit. The company was also hit by an antitrust lawsuit by the Department of Justice in March, but that's not as concerning for investors as the slowing product revenue growth.Despite increasing competition in China, iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the quarter ending in December 2023, with management giving credit to a record number of people upgrading.But it will be challenging for iPhone sales to grow much faster over the long term. The global marketing intelligence firm IDC forecasts smartphone unit shipments will increase by just 2.6% on an annualized basis through 2027.Nonetheless, one opportunity that management is excited about is selling more devices in the enterprise market. This could be a ripe market for its new Vision Pro headset that launched in February. Top companies like Walmart and Nike are investing in Vision Pro and learning ways to bring the device's spatial computing abilities to their employees.The most important growth driver for Apple is increasing the active installed base of devices, which now exceeds 2.2 billion. The Vision Pro could expand this base in the years to come, and importantly, it could help drive higher spending on apps and subscriptions and other high-margin services. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, driven by share repurchases and higher margins from services revenue.Wall Street analysts forecast Apple's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 9% over the long term. Assuming the stock's price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, that would lead to a return of at least 50% by 2029.Tesla is facing similar headwinds. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are gaining market share, while rising interest rates are making it more expensive for people to finance a new car this year. Revenue grew 19% in 2023 but is expected to slow to an increase of 12% in 2024.The company shouldn't be down for long. The EV market is expected to grow 23% on an annualized basis through 2033, according to Precedence Research. In 2025, Wall Street analysts predict that revenue growth will reaccelerate to nearly 20%.Tesla has several advantages: a large charging-station network, a sophisticated smartphone app, and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The investments in AI are not only important for self-driving capabilities but could also help boost efficiency and profits through the use of robots in its factories.It is already one of the most profitable automakers in the world, generating a significantly higher margin than any of the top U.S. manufacturers, but it's not done improving margins. The company is transitioning to its next-generation manufacturing process that is designed to reduce costs, which could lead to higher margins in a stronger sales environment.The tailwind for EV sales and Tesla's ability to crank out more vehicles at a profit is why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 15%. This would be enough to potentially double the stock price over the next five years.If you're looking for the stock that has more upside potential over the next decade, I believe Tesla is the better choice.Apple is a great business, but the smartphone market is further along the global adoption curve than are EVs, which make up a small share of annual car sales. As Tesla continues to drive down costs and release cutting-edge new models like the Cybertruck, the stock could be a rewarding investment.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-30 11:10:00+00:00,Intel's Lunar Lake Could Be a Threat to Apple's MacBooks,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), by virtue of controlling both the hardware and software for its MacBooks, can eke out performance and efficiency that Windows laptops generally cannot. Apple's switch from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CPUs to its own homegrown CPUs has given it even more firepower to widen the gap between its products and the competition.Intel made progress closing that gap with its Meteor Lake laptop chips, which launched in December. Meteor Lake, a disaggregated chip that links together multiple tiles, uses the company's Intel 4 process node for its compute tile and includes capable graphics and an AI accelerator. Performance is solid, and while battery life isn't quite as good as Apple's MacBook Air, it's a step in the right direction.Later this year, Intel is expected to launch two lines of CPUs. Arrow Lake will focus on the desktop and performance, while Lunar Lake will succeed Meteor Lake in laptops.Intel is reportedly doing a few interesting things with Lunar Lake. While the company hasn't disclosed much information, various reports and rumors suggest that Lunar Lake is aimed at bringing Apple-like performance and efficiency to Windows laptops.Lunar Lake will reportedly include integrated memory, just like Apple's chips. In a standard Windows laptop, the CPU and memory are separate. The need to move data from memory to the CPU can create performance bottlenecks, increase power consumption, and boost heat.By putting the CPU and memory together, significant performance and efficiency gains can be achieved. The downside is that laptops with memory integrated into the CPU can't be upgraded. One reason why Apple's MacBooks generally beat Windows laptops in performance and efficiency is this integrated memory design.Of course, Apple has gotten pretty good at designing chips as well. On top of Lunar Lake's integrated memory, reports indicate that Intel is working closely with Microsoft to optimize Lunar Lake for Windows 11.Lunar Lake will also reportedly feature upgraded integrated graphics using Intel's next-generation Battlemage architecture, as well as an upgraded AI accelerator. While Meteor Lake used Intel's manufacturing for the compute tile and TSMC for the other tiles, rumors suggest that Intel is opting for TSMC for everything this time around.This could be an issue of timing. The Intel 18A process won't be ready in time, and with Arrow Lake set to use the Intel 20A process, Intel may not have enough capacity to use its own advanced processes for both chip families. The company will reportedly be using TSMC's N3B process node for the compute tile.Demand for PCs plunged after the pandemic-era boom sputtered out. Global unit shipments dropped by a double-digit percentage in both 2022 and 2023, a miserable result that caused Intel's revenue and profit to tumble. The market is expected to recover this year, which bodes well for Intel's 2024 CPU launches.With Lunar Lake, Intel will have the opportunity to steal back some market share it's lost to rival AMD, as well as help Windows laptops gain ground on Apple. AMD now has a roughly 20% unit share of the laptop CPU market, a percentage that has more than doubled since mid-2018.There are still a lot of unknowns about Lunar Lake, as most of the information available hasn't been confirmed by Intel. But if the company can truly close the performance and efficiency gap with Apple, Lunar Lake could be a big winner for Intel as it rides the PC recovery.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 11:09:00+00:00,"Forget Apple: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the ""Magnificent Seven""","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stock club is almost a year old now, and some of the predictions that originally inspired it are playing out as expected. The ""baby bubble"" that Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett foreshadowed in May 2023 is losing some air.I'm looking at you, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).The electric vehicle pioneer and the iPhone maker have underperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index since the term Magnificent Seven entered Wall Street's lexicon. In fact, Apple investors have lost money on the stock since Hartnett first used the classic Western movie title in a public report.They are still business giants with popular products and trendsetting market footprints. Apple holds on to its trendsetting status by sheer scale -- not many stocks can claim a $2 trillion market cap, after all.Yet it might be time someday soon to rethink the Magnificent Seven components. Apple can regain its seat with another round of game-changing innovations and unheard-of product ideas (the Vision Pro headset probably won't do that job in 2024).And I think it's time to give the crypto market a seat at the Magnificent table. History suggests -- supported by planned technical upgrades to leading cryptocurrency systems -- that another massive price surge is coming up soon. To shrug off this incoming surge as if nothing is happening would be a big mistake.That's why I'd like to print a Magnificent Seven membership card for Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), North America's leading crypto exchange and digital assets promoter.The Magnificent Seven combine amazing innovation and financial might. They dominate large-scale global markets with pioneering technologies and robust investment in research and development (R&D). As undisputed leaders in their fields, their significant impact on market indexes and clear growth trajectories can shape the future economy.Coinbase fits that description to a T. In fact, I would argue that the crypto wrangler's growth trajectory and R&D spending leave Apple far behind.The company stands at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution, perfectly placed to capitalize on these upcoming industry milestones:With the upcoming Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving, historical trends hint at a potential uptick in market activity, drawing attention across the cryptocurrency landscape. This event, along with Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) stepwise upgrades toward a more scalable network, signals a pivotal moment for blockchain technologies.The growing interest in Web3, with its focus on privacy, decentralized finance, and a more user-centric internet, further highlights the sector's potential for expansion. These innovations should generate increased market activity and broader investor interest over time. As a key platform offering access to important Web3 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot (CRYPTO: DOT), Coinbase will undoubtedly benefit from this trend.And the introduction of Bitcoin spot-price exchange-traded funds marks a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. These developments not only underscore the market's maturity but also widen the investor base, channeling more transactions through platforms like Coinbase. Old-school banks are not ready to offer crypto transactions or digital wallets yet, giving Coinbase a huge head start in a digital economy.In this rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, Coinbase is strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated growth and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. These technological advancements and regulatory milestones set the stage for an intense crypto drama over the next couple of years.Game-changing success is never easy, and Coinbase also faces many difficult challenges.The regulatory rule book can change in a heartbeat, perhaps moving in different directions across various countries. The real-world pricing effects of Bitcoin halvings have been predictable so far, but there's no certainty that the next one will unleash the same results. Quantum computing might break the encrypted security model of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies, forcing a brand-new technical design in the long run.I could go on, but you get the picture: Coinbase's near-term and long-term success could be quite likely, but I can never call it ""guaranteed.""But that's why they play the game, right?One investor's best idea can be another's darkest nightmare, and the price of any stock or cryptocurrency is negotiated to settle their differences of opinion. In the long run, the underlying business proves who's right and who's wrong. And in this case, I think Coinbase's growth prospects should lead to impressive shareholder gains in 2024 and beyond.And Coinbase will do it in a market-defining way with a heavy dose of innovation. That makes it a robust ""Magnificent"" candidate, ready to step in if and when Apple misplaces its membership card.Adding Coinbase to the Magnificent Seven vernacular just before the crypto market takes off again could make Wall Street analysts look like prophetic geniuses for a while. So move over, Apple, I think it's time to hand that seat over to Coinbase -- at least for a while.Should you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?Before you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coinbase Global wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 09:48:00+00:00,"Which ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?","When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.Institutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the ""big money"" because of the massive size of their investments.As you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?Roughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.Nasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.Large investors have also flocked to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.Why is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.Nvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.Nasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.Tesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.This leaves Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.However, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.Investing in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.Keep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.All of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.However, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-30 08:45:00+00:00,Will Warren Buffett Sell More Apple Stock Because of the DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit -- and Should You?,"Warren Buffett has been a big fan of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in recent years. However, some might think he's not as enthusiastic about the stock as he used to be. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in the tech giant.This transaction was made before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, were suing Apple because the company allegedly violated antitrust laws. Will Buffett sell more Apple stock because of the DOJ antitrust lawsuit -- and should you?U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the press release announcing the DOJ lawsuit, ""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws."" He added, ""We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.""How does the DOJ think Apple is violating antitrust laws? The department's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey listed several specific allegations against Apple, including that the company:Blocked iPhone apps that would make it easier for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms.Blocked the development of mobile cloud streaming services that would allow consumers to play video games without having to purchase costly smartphone hardware.Excluded messaging apps on iPhones that work well across multiple smartphone platforms.Limited the functionality of rivals to the Apple Watch.Limited rival digital wallets by preventing apps from allowing users to tap to pay.Apple disputes all of the DOJ's allegations. The company responded, ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets."" Apple also said, ""We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.""Could Buffett sell additional shares of Apple because of the DOJ lawsuit? Sure. Will he do so? I doubt it.Buffett has stood by some of his favorite companies in the past that faced antitrust scrutiny. For example, European Union and U.S. antitrust regulators have investigated Coca-Cola. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn't sell any of its position in the food and beverage company.More importantly, Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting last May that Apple was ""a better business"" than any others that the conglomerate owned. I don't think the DOJ's allegations would shift his view, especially so quickly.And maybe, just maybe, Buffett didn't decide to sell Apple shares in Q4 after all. One of Berkshire's other two investment managers could have made the recent sale. The sale of roughly 10 million Apple shares could also have come from Berkshire subsidiary General Reinsurance's portfolio, which Buffett doesn't directly control.I think there are some legitimate reasons to consider selling Apple stock. The company's growth has slowed considerably. Its valuation is arguably too steep in light of this sluggishness, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of 26x.However, it's way too soon to sell because of the DOJ lawsuit, in my view. Apple will almost certainly mount a strong defense against the antitrust allegations. The lawsuit could be more of a distraction than anything else.I also believe there's a compelling reason to hold on to Apple stock. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI. He also said, ""Later this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future.""The company's annual developers conference is scheduled for June 10 through 14. Like many others, I expect Apple will reveal its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy at this conference.The DOJ antitrust lawsuit will likely take years to play out. Apple could have big AI news on the way soon. I intend to hold on to my shares of the tech giant. I suspect that Buffett will too. And I think that any investor who sells before Apple reveals its AI strategy could regret doing so.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-29 22:29:37+00:00,16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit,"In this article, we will take a look at 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. The advantages of international mobility and a second country where one could live and work has gained much prominence over the years. While immigration and citizenship laws across countries have become friendlier (check out our article on 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World), acquiring citizenship or permanent residency requires substantial time-- other than for direct citizenship by investment programs-- and energy. However, another way to live and work in a country can be easily obtained through a residence permit.A residence permit is basically a document that provides the holder a right to live in a specific country for a specific period of time. The residence permit allows one to live, buy property, cross border, do business, take advantage of medical facilities, and enroll in educational institutions, among others. There are multiple ways of getting a residence permit, which includes marriage, work, study, or investment. The need for international diversification in terms of both human force and foreign direct investment has propelled countries to recognize the need for making special provisions for investors, businessmen and highly qualified and skilled individuals.It is thus, no wonder that the issuance of residence permit have registered an increase over the years. In European Union countries, for instance, 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in 2022 to non-EU citizens, a 26% increase (+753445 permit) from 2021. While there are various ways to obtain a residence permit -- with “Employment Reasons” taking the larger share (42%) of all first residence permits for EU countries in 2021 -- the investment route (Golden Visa) is by far the easier and quicker option.The global demand for investor visas have sustained an upward trend with more than 165,000 people opting for them from the US, UK, Canada, and EU countries during the years 2008-2022. One of the popular investor visas include the US EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that has been operating for more than 30 years. From 2010-2019, the US approved 81,125 investor visas, which is higher than the combined visas issued by Canada, UK, and Portugal. A rise in the trend for European Golden Visas have also been noted. Greece, for example, recorded a 63% increase in the demand for their residence permit programs—from January to May 2023, 3,900 Golden Visa applications had been submitted as compared to 1,444 in 2022. Canada, through their Start-Up Visa, also allowed 175 new permanent residents in August, 2023, a 29.6% increase from July, 2023.Developed countries like the US, Canada and EU states have prosperous economies that foster investment. America is the world’s largest national economy and a global leader in trade. Home to some of the top companies in the world like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc., the US investment environment is bound to attract investors and entrepreneurs. Other regions around the world, like Europe, can also boast of growing economies. With a population of about 743.5 million in 2022, twice that of the US, Europe is home to not just a large number of people but also hosts some of the largest economies in the world. Germany, for example had a GDP of $4.26 trillion in 2021, fourth worldwide with regard to nominal GDP. The 27 country European Union economic block accounts for about 14% of the world’s total trade in goods. The total value of goods and services produced in the region also amounted to €14.5 trillion in 2021. Given such statistics, the proliferation of many top-notch multinational companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc. into the area is not surprising.Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), for instance, just recently cemented their European AI investments by announcing a €25M (US$26.98m) investment that is geared towards improvement in AI skills across the region. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) on the other hand, invested an additional €1 billion to expand Silicon Design Centre, earlier last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), has also made a recent commitment to expand their cloud infrastructure to meet the demand in Europe.Let's now head over to the list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence PermitIn order to compile our list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit, we base our method on residence permit received by investment as the easiest way. For this we first select Residency Programs being offered and then pick out the popular or leading Residency by Investment Programs by scouring web as well as our article. We then look at their minimum cost and application processing time and rank them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We take a weighted average for the two metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) allotted to cost and the lower to time (0.4). We present our list in a descending order of rank.Note: The figures for the approximate US Dollar amounts are based on the current exchange rate and are therefore subject to change.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 7Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 22Insider Monkey weighted Average: 13One of the popular countries for investor looking to either gain a residency or citizenship, Malta is also one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. An economically and politically sound country, the country has much to offer investors. The high quality of life to tax advantages, all have contributed to the country’s popularity for residency and investment schemes. According to the requirements of the program, the investor must have at least €500,000 (approximately US $545,000) worth of assets, €150,000 (approximately US $163,500) of which should be invested in liquid financial assets. In addition, other stipulations of the program demand property acquisition or lease as well as economic contribution to Maltese economy and donation to a non-governmental organization. Permanent residency is obtained immediately after the application process is complete, which takes about 6-8 months.Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 6Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 23Insider Monkey weighted Average: 12.8Costa Rica is yet another of the countries that provides easy access to residence permit. With only a US $150,000 investment-- in either property or business -- under the Investor Visa Program, one can find a way to settle down in the country. Forestry projects, however, requires only $100,000 investment. The initial residence permit issued is for two years which is then also renewable, provided the investor maintains the investment. The application process time is a bit higher than other programs, taking about 9 months.Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 13Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 11Insider Monkey weighted Average: 12.2While searching for a country where the residence permit can be obtained easily, Cyprus would appear as a viable option. Not only is the minimum investment choice modest, €300,000 (approximately $327,000) in various types of investments such as property, business, fund, and securities, but the time taken to process the whole application is among the fastest (2 months).Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 9Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 15Insider Monkey weighted Average: 11.4Easy and efficient, Malaysia’s My Second Home Program grants its applicants a 10-year multiple entry visa, which is also renewable. Under this scheme the investor has the choice to pick from three options of investment with different outlay for each. The minimum investment (known as the Silver Tier) corresponds to MYR 500,000 (approximately US $230,000) to be deposited in a Malaysian bank. The tile for application to process is 3-6 months.Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 1Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 26Insider Monkey weighted Average: 11Canada’s Start-Up Visa Program is not only the best Golden Visa program that has been attracted many an investors, but is also one of the easiest for getting a residence permit. This is primarily due to the non-existent cost of the program. Here the applicant is not required to make an investment themselves but can provide backing of accredited external investors. A C$200,000 (approximately US $148,000) commitment from a designated Canadian venture capital funds, a C$75,000 (approximately US $55,500) commitment from part of a designated Canadian angel investor groups, or a confirmation that the start-up is part of a designated Canadian business incubator program are the different options available. The application process time however, is somewhat higher in comparison to other applications.Minimum Investment Cost Rank: 5Minimum Application Process Time Rank: 19Insider Monkey weighted Average: 10.6For people wishful to seek residence in Panama through a quick and easy way of investment, have the choice of two different visas; their Golden Visa known as the Qualified Investor Visa and their Active Investor Visa. Under the qualified investor visa the minimum investment amounts to US $100,000 in a company that has a forest registry with the Ministry of Environment. This will allow a temporary residence of two years and the application processing time is 4 months for the forestry application. Panama also offers an Active Investor Visa known as Panama’s Business Investor Residency Permit.

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now. When interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invesco predicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.During economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanley suggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.According to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a ""stockpicker's market."" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the ""Magnificent 7"" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented: “I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”Some of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.With regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 27: 96.53%SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:SPYG) aims to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 Growth Index before fees and expenses.

In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 27: 97.03%Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks within the S&P 500 Growth Index, which includes growth-oriented companies from the S&P 500.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease.

2024-03-29 13:00:18+00:00,Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.But robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:“Just a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive “tool” rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.”MethodologyThis article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year. We wanted to see whether ChatGPT is any good at stock picking. For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years. We also consulted Finder.com’s experiment with AI in which researchers at the comparison website asked ChatGPT to create a “portfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it is competing against.” This portfolio was also created back in March 2023.  In this article we picked 14 stocks from these two ChatGPT-recommended portfolios with the highest number of hedge fund investors. With each stock we mentioned its performance since the date it was picked up by ChatGPT. The idea is to assess the performance of ChatGPT when it comes to stock picking.Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: Almost flatJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was also among the stocks recommended by ChatGPT to finder.com during the website’s experiment last year. Since the AI model’s recommendation till date the stock price has remained almost flat.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds had stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“The health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large cap pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Johnson & Johnson recently spun out its consumer health care business, becoming a more focused yet broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +6%Benzinga asked ChatGPT to make a stock portfolio to beat the leading equity funds in the US backed in May 2023. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT at the time. Since then through March 27, 2024, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained just 6% as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to battle growth issues amid a slowdown in EV demand.Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +11%Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have gained about 11% since March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended the stock to Insider Monkey’s researchers when they asked the chatbot to suggest stocks that have the potential to make one rich. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been late to the AI game and perhaps that’s why its stock gains aren’t that impressive. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business in China is also facing challenges. Analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reveal its AI projects in the upcoming developer conference scheduled for June.Orbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +14%Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) is one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year when Insider Monkey asked the AI technology to make a portfolio of stocks that would make one rich in the next decade. Since the recommendation date until today, the stock price has gained about 14%.Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“We sold The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). After two years of strong pricing growth, the company is facing slower market growth in both the US and Europe. China, the company’s second largest individual market, is facing a protracted downturn with poor visibility on when fundamentals will improve.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +28%On March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended Visa Inc (NYSE:V) to Insider Monkey, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) shares were trading at around $223, while the stock price sits at $279 today. This shows a 28% gain in stock price.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa Inc (NYSE:V).In its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):“Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +29%When finder.com asked ChatGPT to make a market-beating stock portfolio back in March 2023, the LLM included Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) in the list of its stock recommendations. Since March 6, 2023, through date Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) shares have gained about 29%.Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +42%Insider Monkey asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to make a stock portfolio that'd make one rich in the next ten years. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) was part of the stocks recommended by the large language model. It proved to be one of the best stocks to buy according to AI because since March 16, 2023, the stock has gained about 42%.Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +53%Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT to finder.com when the website asked the chatbot in March 2023 to make a portfolio. Since then through March 27, 2024, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have gained about 53%. Adobe announced a host of new AI-related products at its annual Summit event recently.Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +65%Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best stocks to buy according to AI. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) was recommended by ChatGPT to Insider Monkey when our researchers asked the chatbot to make a market-beating portfolio back in March 2023. Since then through March 27, 2024, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares have gained about 65% in value.Wedbush Securities recently added Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) to its Best Ideas list and said the “perceived” risks to Google Search are overblown and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) remains a “net beneficiary” of generative AI.Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In early 2023, we initiated an investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company’s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.Since we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.The company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy According to AI.

2024-03-29 11:15:00+00:00,"Are the ""Magnificent Seven"" Too Expensive to Buy?","The ""Magnificent Seven"" has driven most of the stock market gains since the beginning of 2023, but each stock is starting to show cracks in its armor. Some of them have gotten far too extended and trade for unreasonable valuations despite the success in their underlying businesses. But are all of them overvalued?Let's examine this group and see if any could be considered cheap or if you'll need to pay a hefty premium to own these seven stocks.The Magnificent Seven is made up of the following companies:Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)2023 was a phenomenal year for this cohort, with the worst-performing stock (Apple) returning nearly 50%. However, 2024 hasn't been so kind, and each stock's performance has been all over the place.Part of this dichotomy has been valuation, as investors aren't willing to pay up to own some of the stocks in the Magnificent Seven.Because the Magnificent Seven are mostly considered growth companies, I'll use their revenue growth combined with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess their valuation; I believe these two metrics show a wider picture. Cost reduction measures can prop up earnings, but those can only grow earnings for so long without any top-line growth.Tesla has had the worst year, losing nearly a third of its value this year. Its declining market value can be attributed to slowing growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales and shrinking margins due to rising competition. The really high premium that investors were willing to pay for the stock tumbled, and now the stock trades for 55 times forward earnings.Apple is in a similar situation, but its problems have occurred for much longer. Throughout 2023, Apple's quarterly revenue either shrank or grew at a 2% pace on a year-on-year basis. That's not great for a company valued like a growth stock, so it is no surprise that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium. Even at its current 26 times forward earnings, the stock still looks pricey for its growth.Besides these two, the rest are up in 2024, but that doesn't mean they are all overpriced.Alphabet and Meta Platforms come to the top of the list for stocks that I believe aren't overpriced. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has had some public relations issues related to the rollout of its generative AI model. However, Alphabet's ad business is still doing well, and with the company trading at 22 times forward earnings, it's the cheapest on the list.Meta isn't much more expensive, with the stock trading at 25.5 times forward earnings. Since its primary business is advertising (through its various social media platforms), it's benefiting from the same ad recovery wave as Alphabet. As a result, it's primed to continue growing for some time.Nvidia isn't as expensive as some may expect, as its vast growth hasn't concluded yet. At 38 times forward earnings, it's quite pricey, but with Nvidia being at the center of the AI revolution with its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), it's to be expected.Amazon is more difficult to assess. It's still optimizing its business for profits, so its forward earnings multiple is skewed and will likely remain that way for some time. At 42 times earnings, it's the second-most expensive on the list. However, with Amazon's rising gross profit margin, it will only be a matter of time before its profits rocket higher and its valuation looks more reasonable.Lastly, Microsoft is one of the most expensive stocks on this list despite being the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Microsoft's valuation is an incredibly pricey 37 times forward earnings -- nearly as expensive as Nvidia's despite far less growth. It earned this premium through fantastic AI product rollout and increased cloud computing market share. However, 37 times earnings is a lot for a company growing at 18% that appears to be fully optimized for profits.So, with all that information, how do these stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive?Ranking the stocks by their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple alone doesn't tell the full picture, as companies like Apple are struggling to grow while Nvidia is tripling its revenue. These rankings won't solely be based on metrics; they'll also include a nod to current growth and future opportunities.With that in mind, here are my rankings of the Magnificent Seven from the cheapest to most expensive:AlphabetMeta PlatformsAmazonNvidiaTeslaMicrosoftAppleRanking Alphabet and Meta as the cheapest was a no-brainer, but I'm also convinced that Amazon and Nvidia have more room to grow, making their expensive valuations seem cheaper in the grand scheme of things. Tesla is hard to figure out, but if EV demand continues to rise, this may be a bargain price. Lastly, Microsoft and Apple are very expensive for their growth, with Apple being the worst offender because it's hardly growing.Although this is my ranking, investors should decide for themselves whether any of these stocks are ""cheap"" enough to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-29 10:45:00+00:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks, Ranked From Best to Worst Performance Over Time","The S&P 500 roared higher over the past year or so from its bear market low to a new all-time high -- and this movement confirmed the market has indeed shifted into bull territory. The gains weren't exactly broad-based though. Stocks dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- drove gains as they soared in the double or triple digits last year.Of course, that's just a short-term increase. But these stocks have proven themselves over a longer period too. Let's take a look at the performance of each of these players over the past five years and see if they still represent compelling buy stories. Here they are, ranked from best to worst, according to performance.Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and share price growth truly took off thanks to its crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used to be best known for their role in gaming -- but the ability to rapidly process many tasks simultaneously made Nvidia's GPUs a perfect fit for AI.Today, Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market, and that's not likely to change as the company invests heavily to stay ahead of rivals. This tech giant just recently announced its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips ever, set for release later this year.Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and share price performance actually have slowed in recent times as various factors weigh on the electric vehicle giant -- from higher costs linked to production ramp-ups to negative foreign exchange impact.But Tesla surged over the past five years as the company delivered more and more vehicles, opened major new factories, delivered record earnings, and built up more than $29 billion in cash. The cash level is particularly important because it will help this ambitious EV leader continue to innovate and potentially progress on programs such as self-driving technology.So, Tesla's slowdown looks like a temporary situation, meaning growth probably isn't over for this market giant.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand strength has helped it keep users coming back to world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac -- and even continue to attract new customers. This has made Apple the go-to stock for the technology investor seeking growth and safety. The company even won over billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has almost half of his portfolio invested in the tech giant.Some may worry that Apple's growth could plateau at a certain point, but one particular thing makes me confident that won't happen. The company's services -- sold to its growing user base -- have taken off, with services revenue reaching records. And this could drive a whole new era of growth for Apple.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), like Apple, is a classic tech company that's proven its strength over the long haul. But in recent times, Microsoft also has shown its ability to seize a growth opportunity. The company was an early believer in AI, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019.The tech powerhouse later extended the partnership and increased its investment, a move that also strengthened the company's cloud business, Azure. This business offers a wide variety of AI tools and has seen its revenue growth soar, rising 30% in the most recent period -- surpassing that of rivals Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Their revenue advanced 13% and 26%, respectively.So, Microsoft clearly could be a winner in the potential AI revolution.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) went through a period of cost cutting in recent times, but at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned for the next step for this social media giant. And that's building up strengths in AI. The company has gone all in on that, developing its own large language model and aiming to apply AI across its products and services.On top of that, Meta's dominance in social media is unwavering, a key point since it, through advertising, brings in most of the company's revenue. It's easy to imagine AI further boosting the company's social media platforms and driving more growth.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has an extremely solid moat, or competitive advantage, in the business that brings in the lion's share of its revenue. And that's Google Search, which holds more than 90% of the global search market. This has kept advertisers coming back, even during recent times of higher inflation.Today, Alphabet, like many of these Magnificent Seven companies, is investing in AI, and this technology is helping it to make search faster and better. This, along with AI offerings through Google Cloud, may power earnings growth in the coming years.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed during the early days of the pandemic as customers flocked to e-commerce -- but a couple of years later, higher inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and the wallets of its customers. And that hurt stock performance, making Amazon the worst-performing of the Magnificent Seven over the past five years (though a 100% gain isn't something to frown about).But the company revamped its cost structure and shifted from an annual loss in 2022 to solid profit in 2023, and the shares went on to gain. And this may continue thanks to Amazon's focus on AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its own operations and selling AI products and services through AWS, the world's cloud services leader.Now, let's get back to our question: Do these high-flying stocks still represent compelling buys? As you can see in the chart, they remain reasonably priced in relation to forward earnings estimates if you consider the long-term growth prospects of each of these players.Tesla is the most expensive by this measure, but these figures consider potential earnings next year -- which is rather short term. The EV giant's moves today to lower the costs of producing its vehicles and incorporate AI in its processes could pay off over the coming years, making today's valuation look fair. Still, other players like Alphabet or Meta clearly are cheap and may represent an even better buying opportunity right now.And here's one important thing to note: Some of these companies went through rough patches in recent times, yet they still managed to deliver big gains over a five-year period. This is a great example of the power of long-term investing, which implies holding on to a stock for at least five years.All of this means it's not too late to get in on some or all of the Magnificent Seven, a group of quality stocks that could continue to deliver top returns over the long haul.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-29 08:41:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Is Raking In $4.36 Billion in Annual Dividend Income From These 5 Stocks,"For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling professional and everyday investors with outsize investment returns. Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 34,000%, including dividends paid, since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares have appreciated by more than 5,000,000%.Buffett and his investment team have long relied on brand-name, time-tested, and well-managed businesses to deliver superior returns. But it's Buffett's preference for dividend stocks that might provide one of the biggest boosts to Berkshire's long-term outperformance.According to a report issued last year by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have produced an average annual return of 9.18% over a half-century (1973-2022). This compares to a modest 3.95% average annual return for public companies that don't offer a payout.Companies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with their investors are almost always time-tested and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. This is why Berkshire Hathaway's $370 billion investment portfolio is packed with dozens of dividend stocks.But diversification was never big with Buffett or his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Although the investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee is on pace to generate about $6 billion in annual dividend income, a whopping $4.36 billion in combined common- and preferred-stock dividends can be traced to just five companies.Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding by market value ($38 billion), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is the Buffett's dividend breadwinner. The more than 1 billion shares of BofA Berkshire owns will yield almost $992 million in annual dividend income.The reason Buffett has long favored financial stocks (especially banks) is because they benefit from disproportionately long periods of U.S. growth. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the U.S. economic cycle, they have all been short-lived since the end of World War II.By comparison, there have been two expansions that surpassed the decade mark. Cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America are able to steadily increase their interest income and fee-generating loan portfolios as the U.S. economy expands.The other well-defined lure for Bank of America is that it's the most interest-sensitive money-center bank in the United States. This is to say that its net-interest income will increase or decrease more with changes to the prevailing interest rate than with other big banks. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle during the past two years has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line.The second-biggest dividend payer in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio might come as a bit of a surprise. Energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which doesn't have a particularly hefty yield, is on pace to provide more than $897 million in aggregate annual income this year.Based on the roughly 248 million shares of Occidental common stock that Berkshire has acquired since the start of 2022, Buffett's company should collect more than $218 million in dividend income this year. But Berkshire also owns $8.49 billion in preferred stock in Occidental that yields 8% annually ($679.2 million a year). This was originally a $10 billion stake, but Occidental has since redeemed $1.51 billion of the issue.The reason Occidental Petroleum is so attractive to Buffett and his crew likely is because it's more linked than other integrated oil and gas companies to the spot price of crude oil. It generates the bulk of its sales from its drilling operations.More than three years of reduced capital investment from major energy companies during the pandemic has constrained global oil supply and provided a lift to the spot price of crude. If prices remain elevated, Occidental should enjoy an outsized benefit.It's probably no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by market value ($154.7 billion), tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), is one of the biggest providers of dividend income. Even after Buffett and his aides pared down Berkshire's Apple stake by some 10 million shares during the fourth quarter, the nearly 905.6 million shares still held will generate about $869 million in annual dividend income.The beauty of Apple stock has long been its exceptional branding, strong customer loyalty, and top-tier innovation. Though it remains the domestic leader in smartphone market share, much of the future growth is expected to come from its shift to services.CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a steady push toward subscriptions, which should smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur just before major iPhone upgrade cycles, as well as keep customers loyal to Apple's ecosystem of products and services.But if you ask Buffett, his favorite thing about Apple might be its market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it has repurchased almost $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only is this providing a boost to Apple's earnings per share, but it is also steadily increasing Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in the company without having to do a thing.Oil stocks are historically known for their robust payouts. In addition to collecting over $897 million from Occidental Petroleum, Buffett's company should be on the receiving end of more than $822 million in annual payouts from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). The dividend hike Chevron announced in February marked the 37th consecutive year it has lifted its base annual payout.Even though Chevron and Occidental are subject to the same macro forces, Chevron's outlook is a bit different than Occidental. That's because Chevron's revenue channels are skewed more toward its non-drilling assets, such as pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These midstream and downstream assets produce highly predictable cash flow in virtually any economy.Chevron also has what can be considered one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies. It closed out 2023 with a net debt ratio of just 7.3%. Given its storied history of generating positive cash flow from its operations, Chevron has the financial flexibility to make big acquisitions and return a lot of money to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.The fifth dividend stock that -- along with Bank of America, Occidental, Apple, and Chevron -- is helping Warren Buffett and his team oversee the collection of $4.36 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).Coca-Cola has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. Because the cost basis on the 400 million shares held by Berkshire is so low (about $3.2475 per share), Coke's $1.94-per-share annual payout equates to a nearly 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company.What's made Coca-Cola stock such a wonderful investment for decades is its geographic diversity. It has operations in every country worldwide with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia. This means it's able to take advantage of faster organic growth in emerging markets, while still generating highly predictable operating cash flow in developed countries. It also has more than two dozen brands that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.Top-shelf marketing is another reason Coca-Cola has been able to increase its annual dividend in each of the past 62 years. It's leaning on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements for younger audiences, and can rely on its well-known brand ambassadors and rich history to connect with more-mature consumers.Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-29 08:09:27+00:00,Huawei Profit Surges as It Takes Share From Apple and Alibaba,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Most Read from BloombergTesla’s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly LineBankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX CollapseApple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up OverseasUBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate FinanceDubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy RussiansThe Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That’s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.The results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.Huawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China’s determination to thwart Washington’s curbs. It’s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.The company’s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company’s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.While Huawei hasn’t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company’s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.Huawei’s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors — including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.IPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.But Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will “do whatever it takes” to protect its national security.Read More: Apple China Slowdown Sparks Fears That Prized Market Is at RiskMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/huawei-profit-surges-takes-share-080927855.html
2024-03-29 04:22:06+00:00,20 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment,"In this article, we will look at 20 countries that receive the most foreign direct investment. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment.The global investment landscape was gloomy in 2022, mainly due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, turbulence in financial markets, and climate change causing investment uncertainty around the globe. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) suffered due to economic volatility but remained more resilient than expected. According to IMF’s World Investment Report 2023, the global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022 after declining 12 percentage points from the previous year. Despite the decline, investment inflows to the developing countries increased marginally; however, growth was concentrated in a few emerging economies. On the other hand, the FDI to the least developed countries declined, with FDI in 46 least developed countries falling to $22 billion after a decrease of 16%. Investors ended the year by announcing new industrial and infrastructural projects. To read more about investments, you can look at 12 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the US and 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.The greenfield investment trends presented a bright spot for the international investment landscape, with the number of new projects increasing by 15% for 2022 and in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The FDI and the number of new greenfield projects also increased in developing countries. The FDI in developing countries increased by 4%, reaching $916 billion. Meanwhile, the number of new greenfield project announcements witnessed a 37% increase, thereby signaling a positive indication for investment prospects in industry and infrastructure. Moving forward, foreign direct investment is expected to increase modestly in 2024. On January 17, Reuters reported that the United Nations trade body was positive about global FDI rising modestly in 2024. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the projections for inflation and the cost of borrowing in the major markets indicate stabilization to attract international investment deals, thereby increasing global FDI in 2024. The organization, however, stressed that the geopolitical risks and high debt levels in some countries could hinder the prospects of FDI. In 2023, the foreign direct investment amounted to approximately $1.37 trillion, a marginal increase of 3% from the previous year. The United States is one of the largest hosts of foreign direct investment and has announced several greenfield projects and international infrastructural and industrial deals.

In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we’ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year.Alphabet Inc.

2024-03-29 01:33:10+00:00,20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World,"In this article, we will be navigating through global homelessness while covering the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World.As reported by the United Nations, homelessness is the deprivation of stable, safe, and adequate housing without being able to obtain it. The concept extends from a lack of physical shelter to social exclusion. Homeless groups include people living in open spaces, streets, temporary emergency accommodations, shelters, camps, as well as informal settlements.The World Economic Forum reports that approximately 150 million people were homeless around the world in 2021. This equates to 2% of the global population without considering the fact that this doesn’t represent real statistics since measuring homelessness is daunting. The global pandemic worsened the state of homelessness worldwide. This was when economies struggled against the lasting impacts of lockdowns and soaring poverty. In this regard, countries have been fighting their battles against homelessness. While modular mini-homes were provided to the homeless in the UK, shipping containers were used to make an apartment complex for the homeless residing in downtown Los Angeles.The United Nations has referred to homelessness as a harmful form of systemic discrimination that impacts people in both developed and developing countries. Previously, we have also discussed the countries with the highest homeless population. Representing developing countries and China, Guyana’s representative exclaimed that homelessness has experienced a rise over the years. In African nations such as Angola, rural poverty primarily drives homelessness. Apart from social inequality and poverty, climate change serves as another cause of homelessness. Small island developing states have been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and storms which massively destroy the social infrastructure while displacing many. Temporary housing and relocation assistance become crucial ways to address disaster-related displacement.On the contrary, the developed United States also continues to find ways to tackle the homeless crisis in the country. On March 22, Reuters reported that more than 653,000 people in America were homeless in 2023, recording a 12% year-over-year increase since 2022. Diverse strategies are being proposed to combat this homelessness. While legislation related to banning people from camping on city sidewalks, parks, and public places was signed in Florida, more than $20 billion has been spent on housing and homelessness programs in California since 2018. Policy experts are of the opinion that access to affordable housing is a better solution rather than clearances that cannot function for a long time. In conclusion, the opposition between a crackdown on camping and raising funding to accommodate the homeless continues across the nation. You can also view the states with the highest homeless population and the cities with the largest homeless populations in the US to have a better understanding of homelessness in the country.Building upon the rising crisis of homelessness penetrating America, local companies continue to address the issue. American companies engaging in the nation’s battle against homelessness include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).The e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) caters to housing affordability and accessibility issues, especially for the deprived. The company’s Housing Equity Fund offers more than $2 billion in below-market loans and grants for 20,000 affordable homes for low-to-middle-income families in the local communities. In collaboration with minority-led organizations, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested more than $760 million in the creation and preservation of 4,500 affordable homes. Partnerships with public transit agencies have also been undertaken to introduce cheap housing near high-capacity public transit areas.Another company ensuring affordability for housing is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company unveiled its Affordable Housing Initiative back in 2019 under which it aimed to fix the shortage of housing and the resulting high prices in Puget Sound region. The region also hosts many people living unsheltered. The company granted $1.5 million in an effort to reduce homelessness across King County.  The firm also supports organizations involved in providing permanent shelter to the homeless and essential services to get people back on their feet. Extending its initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $583 million to create and preserve 9,200 housing units in the Puget Sound region.Homelessness in California was catered to by the leading tech company Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company has committed $2.5 billion to improve the housing crisis across California. The task of constructing affordable housing for the unhoused or those who face the risk of losing their house is being undertaken by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with its community partners. The company is working towards the construction of new homes for 20,000 individuals and another 24,000 to help them stay housed while they are subject to the danger of becoming homeless. It has also helped the nonprofit Home expand its Homelessness Prevention System which provides direct financial assistance.Now that we have taken a look at global homelessness and the ongoing fight against it, let’s move to the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world.20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the WorldOur Methodology:In order to compile a list of the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world, we sourced the most recent data on homelessness from the OECD. We have ranked the countries on our list in descending order of their homelessness to depict the lowest statistics for homelessness across the world. The homeless population for all the countries has been cited from the latest available year as reported by the OECD.Homeless Population (2019): 22,580Austria ranks as one of the countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. Cheaper homes along with the Housing First strategy is targeting homelessness in Austria. The country has planned to offer numerous homeless people their own flats.Homeless Population (2009): 21,216Greece is another country with low homelessness. The Greek capital, Athens, has engaged in providing shelter and food to those who are homeless. However, the country is home to numerous asylum seekers who face homelessness.Homeless Population (2019): 14,013Among other countries, homeless individuals tend to be less in Chile. The country’s extreme winter weather ends up leaving many homeless. The capital city of Santiago hosts many of the homeless people in Chile.Homeless Population (2019): 13,252Colombia ranks among the 20 countries which have low homelessness. The World Bank has also invested in programs directed to improve housing and support for vulnerable neighborhoods in Colombia in the past. These vulnerable communities are deprived of access to safe and decent housing.Homeless Population (2014): 10,068Hungary is another country with low statistics for homelessness. While a portion of the homeless population resorts to emergency shelters, temporary homes, and street outreach services, many tend to sleep rough. Mental health issues, irregular incomes, and addictions are common problems among the homeless sleeping rough in the country.Homeless Population (2019): 7,107Although the homeless population is relatively lower in Portugal, it has been increasing. People residing in mere tents in Lisbon have risen. Increase in drug consumption and immigration are also issues contributing to homelessness in the country.Homeless Population (2017): 6,877One of the lowest homeless populations globally resides in Latvia. Housing affordability is one of the factors impacting homeless people in Latvia since house prices in the country have grown between 2010 and 2023.Homeless Population (2019): 6,431Between 2019 and 2022, homelessness decreased by almost 10% in Denmark. The country hosts a smaller proportion of people who are homeless. The number of street sleepers and younger homeless people declined in the country in 2022.Homeless Population (2020): 5,873Ireland ranks among the countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. However, an increase in adults in emergency accommodations has been noticed especially in Dublin. While the majority of these are Irish, some of them tend to be from the United Kingdom or EEA. A lower proportion were from outside the EEA.Homeless Population (2018): 5,482Finland has addressed the problem of homelessness through its Housing First scheme which was first introduced in 2007. This allows permanent housing on a normal lease to the homeless. Existing social housing in addition to new housing blocks have been utilized to avoid a housing shortage.Homeless Population (2020): 3,992Japan has one of the lowest homeless populations. Homeless people are distributed across Osaka, Central Tokyo, Yokohama, Fukuoka, and Kawasaki. Roadsides, public parks, riversides, and station building hosts many of the homeless Japanese.Homeless Population (2016): 3,909Norway’s homelessness rate is one of the lowest in the world. The homeless population in the country mostly includes non-Norwegian citizens, alcoholics, as well as those who are mentally ill. Norway’s social service system helps combat homelessness in the country.Homeless Population (2019): 3,799The 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world rank Slovenia as well. While many homeless people in the country register at the address of a centre for social work and temporary municipal emergency housing units, others tend to live on the streets.Homeless Population (2020): 3,471Israel ranks as another country where a lesser number of homeless people live. The homeless population in the country experienced a rise during the distress caused by the global pandemic. The Tel Aviv Municipality has made attempts to accommodate the unhoused population in the city.Homeless Population (2020): 3,387Costa Rica ranks as one of the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world.

2024-03-28 22:45:44+00:00,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in March,"If you’re searching for cheap blue-chip stocks to buy, look no further. Blue-chip stocks continue to lag the performance of growth stocks. Although it is currently at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprised of 30 blue-chip names, is up only 4% this year compared to an 11% gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq index. While some blue-chip stocks are performing strongly, many well-known companies are seeing their share price slide lower and badly lagging the market’s overall performance. The declines, while notable, should be seen as a buying opportunity in many instances.Some of the stocks that are down this year are struggling with short-term issues that are beyond the company’s control. In time, the situation should resolve itself and the share price should move higher. It’s also good to have blue-chip stocks in one’s portfolio as these securities can be defensive in times when the market drops or the economy falters. Plus, stalwart blue-chip stocks are more likely to pay dividends than fast-growing tech stocks and start-up companies. Buying when prices are down and riding them higher should be the goal of every investor.Here are seven blue-chip stocks to buy at or near their 52-week low in March.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockThe Golden Arches is as blue-chip as stocks come. The hamburger and restaurant chain has been a reliable performer for decades, trades at a reasonable 24 times future earnings estimates, and pays a quarterly dividend that yields a strong 2.40%. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend payment every year since 1976. Yet MCD stock has struggled in recent years. Year-to-date (YTD), the share price is down 6%. Over five years, it is up only 45%.The softness in MCD stock is curious given that the company is in the midst of an aggressive growth strategy, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. McDonald’s also continues to diversify its menu, recently announcing that it will sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its more than 13,500 restaurants across America.But while news of the Krispy Kreme partnership sent DNUT stock up 30% in one day, it barely moved the needle on MCD stock. Time to buy the dip.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockArguably the best deal in the market right now is the stock of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics giant’s share price is down nearly 10% on the year and not far from its 52-week low. Slowing sales in China and an antirust lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Justice Department have pushed AAPL stock down since the start of the year. Smart investors will treat the decline as a buying opportunity.Despite the headwinds it faces, Apple continues to keep its business chugging along. In recent weeks, the company announced that it plans to start selling its new Vision Pro augmented reality headset in China. Also, Apple is reportedly in talks to license Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and integrate it into future iPhones.The addition of AI sets up iPhone for potentially its biggest upgrade in years and could give the smartphone a whole new competitive advantage.Source: lentamart / ShutterstockA huge buy-the-dip opportunity has opened up with the stock of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) after the company’s latest earnings print. LULU stock fell more than 10% after the retailer issued weak forward guidance and said that its North American sales are slowing. The post-earnings decline has dragged the share price 23% lower year to date. However, this popular athletic apparel maker’s stock is not likely to be down for long.While it is true that Lululemon’s North American sales have decelerated, the company is killing it with its international expansion. For the final quarter of 2023, the company’s international sales grew 54% year-over-year, with sales in the key market of China increasing 78%. Lululemon’s total sales, North America included, were up 16% from a year ago. The strong international growth and overall growth are not reflected in LULU stock.Lululemon also continues to expand beyond its traditional focus on women consumers, moving into men’s wear and launching in February a new line of men’s sneakers. Sneakers and casual footwear, both men’s and women’s, represent a huge new market for Lululemon Athletica.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockCan software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) survive an existential threat posed by AI? That’s the question facing the company as its share price has fallen 13% so far in 2024. ADBE stock began to sink after privately held OpenAI launched a new text-to-video generator that competes against its own creative software products that include Photoshop and Illustrator. The situation hasn’t been helped by Adobe’s latest earnings print.Adobe offered up forward guidance that disappointed analysts on Wall Street. The company also got dinged for canceling its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee. The guidance and Figma fee overshadowed the fact that Adobe reported strong financial results that beat analyst forecasts. The company also announced a $25 billion stock buyback program.Adobe is not taking the threat from OpenAI and other competitors lying down. Over the last year, the company has added AI features to many of its software products, including an image editing tool called Firefly.Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.comWe’re heading into the Easter long weekend, and one would assume that this would be a great time to be a shareholder of Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY). After all, Americans spent $3.3 billion on Easter chocolate and candy in 2023, up 8.2% from the previous year. Sadly though, there is not much reason to celebrate the Easter Bunny’s arrival this year. Not with cocoa prices trading at an all-time high and above $10,000 per metric ton for the first time ever.Record prices for cocoa is a huge problem for Hershey, which spends more than $1 billion a year on the active ingredient in chocolate. Cocoa prices have risen 40% this year due to global supply constraints. The problem lies in the Ivory Coast of Africa, which is the biggest cocoa producer in the world. The region has been hit by both flooding and hotter-than-usual temperatures that are causing drought conditions and diminishing crop yields.The flooding and excessive heat has also led to an outbreak of cacao swollen shoot virus that is harming the cocoa crop. The world’s supply of cocoa is now on course for a third straight annual supply deficit. The worsening problem has HSY stock down 24% over the last 12 months and not far from its 52-week low. But long-term, Hershey remains a solid investment. Here’s hoping cocoa prices move lower before Halloween.Source: saaton / Shutterstock.comWe’re barely through one quarter of the year, and already 2024 has been tough on pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). In early January, the company cut its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%, sending WBA stock plunging. Then, the company was kicked out of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further hurting its share price.The net effect is that WBA stock is down 23% on the year. That brings its 12-month decline to nearly 40%. While things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and preserve cash.Additionally, Walgreens’ most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comHow low can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock go? A lot lower according to analysts who cover the company. Down nearly 30% on the year, TSLA stock is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 index. However, each day seems to bring a new analyst downgrade for the stock. Most recently, analysts at Bernstein lowered their price target on Tesla’s shares to $120 from $150 and reiterated a “sell” equivalent rating.Bernstein, and others, are worried about slumping global demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles, especially in China. They’re also seeing weak demand for Tesla’s Model 3 electric vehicle stateside. The piling on has hurt investor sentiment related to TSLA stock and pushed the share price lower. Approaching a 52-week low, and with its market capitalization sliding to $500 billion, its fair to wonder, what’s next for Tesla?Despite the glum situation, there’s every reason for investors to buy-the-dip in TSLA stock. The company is taking steps to right the ship, including raising prices and offering a free trial of its full self-driving feature. Also, the stock has fallen sharply in the past and always comes roaring back. This time is likely to be no different.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

2024-03-28 21:11:33+00:00,Q1 2024 Takeaways: The rise and fall of the Magnificent Seven,"As the first quarter of 2024 draws to a close, Yahoo Finance's Head of News Myles Udland joins Market Domination Overtime to recap the market highlights of the past quarter.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019. While 2023 saw the Magnificent Seven tech stocks fuel market gains initially, the first quarter of 2024 is ending with only four of those names — Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) — carrying the momentum. Apple (AAPL) continues to struggle, declining for three straight months.As the gains broaden to other sectors of the market, Energy, Materials, Utilities, and Financials all benefited and were the best-performing sectors for the first quarter.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithMYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, going through-- I was-- I was following along as Jared was breaking down all of these superlatives really for the market over the last year or this quarter. And I think what's interesting is looking at the S&P on two levels. You can look at the biggest winners this year within the index. And you're seeing a lot of the mega-cap names and notably, that is pushing the S&P to outperform the NASDAQ, which in an AI field trade doesn't exactly feel right.But that picks up on two parts. One, you've got Apple down 10% this year. Two, you've got Eli Lilly up 34% this year. That company is closing in on trillion dollar market cap, which of course, brings us to the Magnificent Seven really kind of breaking up. It's become the Magnificent Four. Jared, I don't know if you have a view on whether it's three or four. Like, does Amazon get bolted on there? Is it really just Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA? But seeing that trade separate out has really been an interesting theme through the first quarter.JARED BLIKRE: I'm going to take that. I'm going to go in a slightly different direction. Just in terms of the broadening theme here, we've seen materials come alive. We've seen financials come alive. But I just want to let-- I just want to explore how big the AI trade is because we're not just seeing it expressed in NVIDIA, we're talking about infrastructure of the United States.People that power grids, all kinds-- you know, Roper Technologies. There's just a bunch of smaller names that we don't talk about on a day-to-day basis that have really come alive and have been posting record highs. They might not be the biggest percentage gainers but they are the backbone of this rally. So when we say an AI-led rally, yeah, I would argue it's encompassing a lot bigger percentage of the S&P 500 than people are giving it credit for well.AKIKO FUJITA: The AI trade's still very much intact. And so you're saying-- we're talking about other names that are sort of coming.JARED BLIKRE: The AI trade itself is broadened.MYLES UDLAND: Well, and in looking at-- and so SMCI, Super Micro Computer, best performer in the S&P so far this year, stocks up 250%. But you look at those sectors, energy, materials, utilities, the sixth best performer in the S&P this year, GE. That stock is-- but that's kind of derivative of that play. And of course, that stock is going to see a change next week and how it's going to break apart. So you're going to have different units trading within the index.But 38% rally for GE this year. And I think it really speaks to the way that the market just-- it just ended, you know, I made the joke in our Slack channel like 10 minutes ago. It just feels like 2021 is meshing with 2022 to get the 2024 market energy.JARED BLIKRE: And you've got tech.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, you've got the [? mean ?] blowoff, plus you've got energy. The only thing lagging-- you know, the only sector in the red is real estate.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Well, thank goodness we just had that Reddit IPO because that just circles whatever, I guess, square that we were trying to complete there. I don't-- I don't have a lot to add to that. I just think it's really impressive just some monthly streaks here. So we have the majors, those are up five straight months. Bitcoin is up seven straight months. And let's not forget, that really came alive last year before that kind of-- I think that started in early October, not even with the October lows but a few weeks before that. XLK, that's tech up six months.What else? WTI crude, that has been a sleeper story. We haven't seen it explode to the upside. Nevertheless, crude oil up three months. And then some of the mega-cap stuff like Meta up seven months in a row, Amazon up six. But Apple, this says a lot, Apple down three.AKIKO FUJITA: But going back to your point about the Magnificent Seven becoming the Mag Four now, right? I mean, you could argue that Apple could push higher. If what Dan and I've said about the announcements coming through here, you know, that could be a significant catalyst. Is that ultimately a good thing that we're starting to see this break apart though because that points to just how investors are looking at individual company stories as opposed to it as a group?MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. I mean, I think that-- I think if you're bullish in-- I mean, I think we can say it feels like a bull market, right? So you're going to have rotations within that context. And you can always say, concentrated leadership is good because people like this theme or broadening leadership is good because now there's multiple themes that are in play.Ultimately for the market, and I was looking at some stats that went around yesterday, Apple has not been a laggard relative to the market to this extent since 2013. So the more that the Apple story goes along and the more it becomes, I guess, to that question Akiko, an Apple-specific story, yeah, I think the read through if anything on a macro level is it's more positive for the index overall that we can see our largest, most profitable company kind of hit, I don't want to call it a rough spot, but a spot where investors for the first time in a while have questions. Seeing the Market Act well in the context of that is probably all else equal, a positive sign for the market.- Yeah, it is amazing. I mean, a year ago if I told you that storyline that Apple wouldn't work but the market could, there'd probably be a lot of skepticism.MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. One thing that's interesting about like the stock, there's something about Apple, like the conversation around the company because we're sitting here surrounded by Apple products, all we use is Apple products, it's like there's never a question--JARED BLIKRE: This is Microsoft right here.MYLES UDLAND: Well, maybe Jared is the problem.[LAUGHTER]It just feels to me-- I mean, Josh, you've covered the company for a long time. It just felt to me like the product primacy of the company has not been in question for like 15 years. And so the stock story has never really been that interesting because like when it goes down, everyone's like, well, everyone has an Apple and everyone has iPhones. And then when it goes up, it's like, well, of course, it goes up.They buy back a ton of stock. They pay a nice dividend. No one gets in trouble, to use the portfolio manager phrasing, for buying Apple, for being overweight Apple, for owning a lot of Apple. And these moments, these quarters, these half years when the stock comes into question is always a strange time because I guess, to Akiko's question, it's like, the read through for the market becomes a very challenging to make.I mean 2019, Apple comes out and says we have a huge problem in China. Stock market went up what, 30% in 2019? It was fine. So it has just-- in a weird way, maybe it's not the macro indicator we think just because it's the biggest company.AKIKO FUJITA: We'll see, right, in this quarter with the big announcement.MYLES UDLAND: I mean, it's like the question is, do we care more about what Mark Zuckerberg says in three weeks than Tim Cook? Maybe. Maybe that's where we're at. It matters more--AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about it.MYLES UDLAND: I guess.AKIKO FUJITA: Myles following that story.MYLES UDLAND: If I'm invited, of course. Of course.AKIKO FUJITA: Myles and Jared, thanks so much.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/q1-2024-takeaways-rise-fall-211133647.html

2024-03-28 19:15:36+00:00,"Apple's new iPad Pro likely to launch in May, ramps up overseas production, Bloomberg News reports","(Reuters) - Apple's overseas suppliers have increased production of the company's new iPad models and plans to launch them in early May, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people with knowledge of the matter.Apple's initial plan was to launch the new iPads by late March or early April, but it is still working to finish the software for the devices, the report added.The new iPad Pro models will have Apple's latest M3 chip and will come with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the report said.This update would represent Apple's first overhaul to that lineup since 2018.The iPad Air will get a new processor, and the 12.9-screen size, according to the report.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The iPhone maker had said on Tuesday it will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 10 to June 14 amid reports it was in talks for an AI partnership and could unveil significant changes to the iOS.(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apples-ipad-pro-likely-launch-191536898.html
2024-03-28 17:47:54+00:00,Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s overseas suppliers have ramped up production of the company’s long-anticipated new iPads and a launch is planned for early May, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Most Read from BloombergTesla’s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly LineBankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX CollapseApple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up OverseasUBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate FinanceDubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy RussiansThe release will center on revamped versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.The move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.After a run-up during the pandemic, iPad sales have fallen in each of Apple’s last two fiscal years, which run through September. They suffered an additional 25% year-over-year decline during the latest holiday period, when the devices have typically been popular gifts.A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.The iPad Pro models — codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 — will run the new M3 chip and work with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The update represents the first overhaul to that lineup since 2018.The iPad Air, meanwhile, was last updated in 2022 with the M1 chip. It will get a new processor, and the 12.9-screen size means consumers can get a large iPad for less money than the more upscale Pro. The current iPad Air starts at $599, while the Pro line costs $200 more.Apple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices. The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.An early May product release would come about a month before Apple’s next major event. On June 10, the company plans to kick off its weeklong Worldwide Developers Conference. There, Apple is expected to unveil a renewed artificial intelligence strategy — alongside software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and Vision Pro headset.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-plans-ipad-pro-may-174754430.html
2024-03-28 17:45:24+00:00,16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.If there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).Now, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.So naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.Yet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.NVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:Yes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.Jensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.So, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying.

2024-03-28 14:46:45+00:00,Oregon’s new right to repair law bans ‘parts pairing’ in defiance of Apple,"As we reported a week ago, new United Nations data shows that people are creating electronic waste at a rate five times greater than that for e-waste collection and recycling. Well, here’s something that should help the pushback against this alarming, wasteful trend.Yesterday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek signed into law the newest and toughest right-to-repair act in the U.S. This is the fourth such state law in the country, and it goes even further than California’s good effort last October, in particular by resisting Apple’s lobbying and banning the use of “parts pairing” to hinder independent repair services.Parts pairing is when an electronics manufacturer digitally pairs a component’s serial number to that of the machine it goes into. So, in the case of an iPhone, an Apple-made battery taken from a smashed-up handset can’t simply be swapped into another iPhone that needs it, without triggering scary warning messages about potentially unofficial parts. A swapped-in selfie camera won’t work properly, despite being an official Apple part. Same goes for a screen, which may not be able to have its brightness adjusted, for no good reason.As the New York Times reported last year, this tactic has made Apple billions of dollars, by steering customers towards the pricey AppleCare insurance policy, under which the company will repair screens and replace batteries. So it’s no surprise that Apple tried to convince Oregon lawmakers not to ban the practice, telling them that the move would “undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin and consumer devices.”Well, that didn’t work. Oregon’s Right to Repair Act passed each stage of the legislative process comfortably. For any devices sold after the start of next year, manufacturers won’t be allowed to use parts pairing to reduce a device’s functionality or performance, or to “display misleading alerts or warnings…about unidentified parts,” or to stop any device owner or independent repair business from installing a perfectly functioning part. (Other parts of the law, such as those requiring manufacturers to allow people to fix their own devices, apply to stuff that was sold after mid-2015, or mid-2021 in the case of smartphones specifically.)“By keeping products running and off the scrap heap, repair cuts waste and saves consumers money,” said Nathan Proctor, right-to-repair campaign chief at the Public Interest Research Group, which aided the campaign for the law in Oregon. “People are tired of not being able to fix things. Lawmakers have gotten the message and, in turn, are sending that message to the manufacturers.”Incidentally, while Apple opposed the parts-pairing shift, smartphone rival Google did not. Indeed, its devices operations chief Steven Nickel earlier this year wrote an open letter supporting the bill, saying it “requires that as manufacturers we design products in a manner that enables simple, safe, and correct repairs wherever and by whomever they are done,” adding: “This is what we call design for serviceability.”More news below.

2024-03-28 14:00:01+00:00,Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on the podium for being among the most well-known, highest-market capitalized and profitable companies in the world. It generally needs no introduction, but as it says in its 10-K filing:""Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple's five software platforms iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.""Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.At its core, the company has this double strategy of manufacturing and selling both the hardware (PCs, tablets, smartphones and accessories) as well as the software.The company is divided in to two main businesses: Products (basically hardware) and Services, which make up the huge $383 billion in revenue. Apple further divides its business into five categories. The iPhone has the lion share of it all with 52.20% of net sales, followed by Services (22.20%) and then the other hardware/products, Wearable, Home and Accessories (10.40%), Mac (7.60%) and iPad (7.40%).What does Apple mean by services, exactly? Well, the list is long and chances are you know them all, but they encompass advertising (including third-party licensing arrangements and the company's own advertising platforms), AppleCare (a portfolio of fee-based service and support products), Cloud Services (with interactions also with Windows personal computers), Digital Content (App Store, etc.), subscription-based services (including Apple Arcade for games, Apple Fitness+SM for personalized fitness, Apple Music, Apple News+ and Apple TV+ with exclusive original content and live sports ever expanding). Last but not least are Payment Services (including Apple Card, a co-branded credit card not yet available in Italy, and Apple Pay, a cashless payment service based on NFC technology).The newest of these services is Apple Sports, which was launched in February. The free app provides real-time scores for sporting events, key statistics and betting odds.Source: Apple's official website.This vast segment as a whole represents one of the most promising growth factors due to the loyalty of Apple's user base with various estimates ranging around 80% and a high user retention of around 90%.This is a key factor as the hardware part of the company is approaching its saturation (especially referring to iPhones). As CEO Tim Cook noted in the company's latest earnings release:""We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.""Taking a closer look at Apple's margins for its services, the results are eye-watering. A 70% gross margin is quite impressive for a category still considered to be in its growth phase.Source: Apple's 10-K.It is also important to mention the tech giant's global footprint. Over the past three years, it has made around half of its sales from outside the Americas. This means $93 billion from Europe, plus $72 billion from China, $24 billion from Japan and $29 billion from the rest of Asia Pacific in the last fiscal year alone. Attached to the wide diversity in its cash streams is the sensitivity the company has to foreign exchange fluctuations, which can be estimated to be around 3%. Do remember that a stronger U.S. dollar leads to lower sales, all other factors being equal.This is a strong point against those saying the company is American. Rather, one could argue it is a truly global company.I am not sure what Apple's future holds in respect to artificial intelligence, but some key factors to consider should be the fact the company has a proven track record of innovation, an abundance of cash resources ($61.50 billion as per the most recent fiscal year), a high rate of strategic acquisitions (reported to have acquired more than 30 AI companies in 2023) and the availability of massive data sets to train machine learning algorithms.As for the VisionPro headset, I am not pricing this fancy new virtual reality product into the valuation yet. The motivation is twofold: (a) I have not used it yet and (b) I do not fully understand its true potential, nor does the general public. Will it be like the iPhone back in 2007 when it launched and Steve Ballmer famously laughed at its high price tag (around $500) with the then-unthinkable lack of a physical keyboard?Prepare to discover it!As is always the case with tech companies, Apple is facing several risks in both the short term and long term.Some new risks regard the increasing probability of opening up the App Store (as per legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, the anticompetitive investigation around Epic Games and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)), but also the growing and sticky China restrictions (as in the sales of iPhones).Last but not least, the crowded smartphone industry, especially with Asian companies (notably the fierce competition from Samsung (XKRX: 005930), which recently already added AI capabilities to its new Galaxy S24 device).It is not easy to value the stock. Since one of the company's major characteristics is its record-breaking market capitalization ($2.62 trillion as of the time of writing), valuation by comparison is quite impractical. It would mean making a lot of assumptions (e.g., economy of scale, tangibleness of business model), hence potentially invalidating the results. Apple has definitely maintained a solid balance sheet since its founding, but lately this trend has been inverting.Since 2019, some common financial strength ratios have decreased, in particular due to declining cash and equivalents and short-term investments, to the tune of $39 billion over a five-year period. Accumulating liquidity forever was obviously a synonym for poor usage of resources and a non-desired goal. The time came to put this huge pile of cash to work during the final years of the Covid-19 pandemic as inflation and increased competition impacted tech stocks.The sterile financial ratios, with a current ratio of 0.98 and a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.68, only tell one side of the story. On the flip side, Apple managed to post sound business performance with a 59% increase in cash from operations and an even more impressive 68% surge in free cash flow over the same period from 2019 to 2023. Also beware that wise usage of funds has been a distinctive feature of Apple that averaged a return on invested capital of 25% in the last decade, never posting a single-digit figure in this metric.Given all that, I base my valuation on free cash flow and its trend over the past five years, starting from a value of $105 billion.Source: Author's calculations.The company uses it cash mostly to repurchase shares. During 2023, $76.60 billion worth of common stock was repurchased and it paid $15 billion in dividends. The current dividend yield is quite low at 0.50%. Not only is this good fiscally, but also for shareholders.I imputed different growth rates for year one to five and six to 10, as well as different discount rates and terminal value multiples according to five hypothesized Mr. Market manic-depression moods. With respect to the broader enterprise value, the results are surprising.There is no one scenario in which Apple can comfortably be viewed as on sale or a possible buy.Assuming the 15.80 billion in fully diluted shares outstanding, the overvaluation ranges between 10% and 74%.Source: Author's calculations.The market is currently giving the stock a price-earnings ratio in line with the average for the hardware industry of 26, but much more weight is given to the sales, as shown by the high price-sales ratio of 6.93.Sometimes it is better to buy great companies at fair prices than the other way around (credits to the late Charlie Munger). This time I do not feel comfortable about the fair price even though I consider Apple to be great. The stock can be considered overvalued currently.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-compounding-machine-slowing-down-140001686.html

2024-03-28 13:27:51+00:00,"Xiaomi Enters Cutthroat EV Race With $29,900 SU7 Series","(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp. is kicking off sales of its first electric vehicles with aggressive pricing, betting the Chinese smartphone maker can succeed in a cutthroat market where Apple Inc. faltered.Most Read from BloombergLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth BillionsDubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy RussiansBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll ShowsChina Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest BanksUBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate FinanceCo-founder Lei Jun presented his strategy in Beijing Thursday evening with the base SU7 model costing 215,900 yuan ($29,900) and prices stretching up to 299,900 yuan for the SU7 Max. Xiaomi aims to begin mass deliveries by the end of April and is sweetening the deal for early orders with additional freebies like a built-in fridge.These vehicles are the culmination of a multiyear undertaking with a $10 billion budget and lofty expectations. Xiaomi benchmarked itself against Tesla Inc.’s Model 3 in most respects and sought to match the electric Porsche Taycan with its top-performance edition, Lei said.Lei’s announcement of the SU7 range and launch date triggered a surge in Xiaomi’s shares this month — even without the disclosure of pricing. Investors cheered the diversification away from the stagnant smartphone business, but Xiaomi still has much to prove as it enters a wholly new product category.Like Apple in the US, Xiaomi saw the opportunity to expand into EVs at a time that cars were adding more electronics and connectivity — though Apple canceled its car project in February, while the Chinese firm is proceeding.“I didn’t expect Apple to quit,” Lei said on stage in Beijing, before an audience of tens of millions across Chinese streaming platforms. After diving into the details of his cars’ design and engineering — from nine different color options to a laptop-friendly glove box and triple-layer UV protection in the windshield — the CEO returned to the topic of his smartphone-making rival. “Xiaomi will support Apple users just as well,” he said.Turquoise-blue models of the new vehicles have been on display in Xiaomi stores across China this week, giving customers an early look. The company’s shares rose 1.2% in Hong Kong on Thursday ahead of the price reveal. The CEOs of fellow Chinese automakers Xpeng Inc., Nio Inc. and Li Auto Inc. and the chairs of BAIC Motor Corp. and Great Wall Motor Co. were in attendance and acknowledged as friends by Lei.The global EV market, once a booming sector with vast subsidy-assisted opportunity, has turned into a highly competitive arena. Tesla and BYD Co. dominate in China, the largest individual market, and are fighting a price war that’s putting pressure on smaller players. Xiaomi hopes to draw away domestic consumers with its offering, which was conceived by a team led by former BMW AG designer Tianyuan Li and had consulting help from Chris Bangle, formerly of BMW and Fiat SpA.Beijing-based Xiaomi is looking for the next stage of its evolution, having grown into one of the world’s top three smartphone makers with a strategy of selling low-margin, high-spec devices online.One example of a tech company making a successful EV foray comes from Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecommunications conglomerate, which is providing technology solutions to carmakers and displaying the Aito EVs in its stores.Read More: Xiaomi Unveils EV in Bid to Become China’s Porsche or TeslaTo avoid delays in obtaining regulatory approval, Xiaomi partnered with state-owned Beijing Automotive Group Co. for the new vehicles. The cars are going on sale in 59 stores across 29 Chinese cities.Initiated three years ago, Lei has called the EV endeavor his final entrepreneurial bet and has dedicated most of his attention to it in recent times. Xiaomi aspires to become a top global carmaker in 15 to 20 years, Lei said when he first unveiled the SU7 in December. President Lu Weibing has added that the company’s goal is to have one of China’s three best-selling luxury EV models.The ambitious EV bet arrives at a time of slowing growth for China’s electric car purchases. Industry bodies project 25% growth in sales for 2024, down from 36% last year and 96% in 2022.(Updates with details from Xiaomi’s presentation from second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/xiaomi-enters-cutthroat-ev-race-132751551.html
2024-03-28 13:21:19+00:00,Energy stocks lead March gains in sign of broadening market rally,"March has been a solid month for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) — and an even better one for oil- and gas-related stocks.As the month draws to a close, energy has emerged as the top-performing sector. The S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE), which includes oil giants like ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP), has gained more than 9% compared to the benchmark index's rise of nearly 3% in the same period.The Energy sector is also one of the biggest winners year to date, behind Communications Services and Information Technology.Energy's outsized rise comes as oil futures have climbed more than 13% since the start of 2024. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, were trading near $82 and $86 per barrel, respectively, on Wednesday.Falling inventories earlier this month, drone attacks against Russian refineries, and continued output cuts from oil alliance OPEC+ have helped move the price of crude futures higher in March.This week Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the Energy sector to Overweight from Neutral, noting that earnings could be revised higher. They also cited ""strong breadth and compelling valuation.""""The recent stability of crude prices also points to a catch up in both relative performance and earnings growth, in our view,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson.The analyst highlights the firm's forecast of $90 per barrel for Brent by the third quarter due to tighter supply-demand balances.Wilson wrote, ""The divergence between oil prices and the sector's relative performance is likely to close via a catch up in Energy equities.""Among some of the biggest movers: Diamondback Energy (FANG) is up 26%, and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and ExxonMobil are each up roughly 15% year to date.The rotation into energy-related stocks marks a reversal from 2023's market action, when XLE ended the year down more than 3% as oil fell 10% from the prior year.The gains this year hint at a broadening of the market rally beyond the Magnificent Seven trade, which itself has shown signs of waning as Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) have lost value this year.""We think the Mag Seven is going to become the Lag Seven,"" Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this month.""At this point in time, we're going to start to see a broadening out of this market,"" he added.Last month Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian called for a broadening of the rally by June.Subramanian's research showed the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to grow earnings by more than the Magnificent Seven in the fourth quarter of this year.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-28 11:57:00+00:00,The Top 2 Dividend Payers From 2023 Were Both Tech Giants,"Are you looking for quality dividend stocks to hold in your portfolio? You may be tempted to look at financial stocks, defensive stocks, or simply businesses that are more closely associated with safety rather than growth potential. But growth stocks can make for potentially underrated income investments, especially in tech.According to the most recent issue of the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, the top two dividend payers, in terms of actual cash paid out last year, were Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Although they don't offer the highest yields, these companies have been paying a ton in dividends. And in the long run, they could become great dividend growth stocks.Tech giant Microsoft paid out the most in dividends last year, with a generous $20.7 billion paid out to its shareholders over its most recent four quarters. The company has routinely been on the list of the top dividend payers, and it has occupied one of the top three spots in each of the past four years. You might be surprised that the stock ranks so highly given that Microsoft's yield looks incredibly underwhelming at just 0.7%, which is far below the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. But with the company having more than 7.4 billion shares outstanding and its current dividend now paying investors $3 per share over the course of a year, it's easy to see how that tally can get so high in a hurry. The yield, after all, is simply a function of the dividend per share divided by the stock price. And with Microsoft's stock trading north of $420, a $3 dividend isn't going to represent a big percentage of the price.Microsoft's payout ratio is only 25% and there's plenty of room for the company to get bigger, especially since Microsoft anticipates that its top line could grow by $10 billion annually simply due to artificial intelligence. Plus, with its acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard now complete, it has also strengthened its growth opportunities in gaming.The tech giant has generated $82.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months on revenue of $227.6 billion. With exceptional financial numbers and still a lot of growth left, this can be an excellent dividend stock to buy and hold for not only years but decades. Microsoft has been increasing its dividend for nearly 20 straight years.Apple is a bit of a distant second on the list, paying shareholders $15.1 billion last year, but it was still good enough for second place. Like Microsoft, it's not uncommon to find Apple's name among the list of top dividend-paying companies. Apple has 15.4 billion shares outstanding and pays out $0.96 in dividends per share over the course of a year.Apple's business has been transitioning more toward services in recent years, which can be a great way for the company to upsell existing customers. Whether it's music, streaming, news, fitness, or other subscription options, there are many ways for Apple to deliver some additional value to its nearly 1.5 billion active iPhone users in the world. The company is still focusing on growth initiatives as well. There are rumors it is working on its own chatbot some are calling ""Apple GPT,"" which could lead to yet another subscription opportunity for the business. Apple's Vision Pro headset is another potential growth driver in the future, and it may be a way to enhance existing apps and services. The business still has plenty of room to get bigger in the years ahead, and the dividend that income investors receive is likely to grow as well.Over the past 12 months, Apple has generated $385.7 billion in revenue and $100.9 billion in profit. Its payout ratio of 15% is even lower than Microsoft's. Its 0.6% yield, however, is also slightly lower. But the company has been regularly increasing its dividend payments since 2013 and with a boatload of profit, plenty of more growth opportunities, and an incredibly low payout ratio, this is another underrated dividend growth stock income investors shouldn't overlook.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-28 11:40:00+00:00,The Biggest Bear Case for This Top Warren Buffett Stock,"Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of companies in its massive $370 billion public equities portfolio. But there's one that stands out above the rest.I'm talking about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker represents a whopping 42% of the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate's holdings. This certainly means that there are individual investors out there who are considering buying the FAANG stock.While Apple has worked out as a fantastic investment in the past several years, it isn't without a key downside factor that you should know about before rushing to buy shares. With that being said, here's the biggest bear case for this top Buffett stock. The Oracle of Omaha first purchased Apple shares during the first quarter of 2016. From the start of that year to March 25, the stock has soared 552%. This gain easily trounces the broader Nasdaq Composite index.Consequently, Apple shares are expensive. They trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7 right now. That's a significant premium to the stock's trailing-10-year average of 21.1.The current valuation is about 150% more expensive from a P/E perspective than when Buffett bought the stock in the first quarter of 2016. He correctly identified a mispricing opportunity by the market and took full advantage of it. Today, Apple stock is fully appreciated by investors, leaving minimal margin of safety.It's very easy to blindly follow a legendary investor like Buffett, buying the stocks that Berkshire owns. But it's always a good idea to think independently about a particular business.After Apple's huge price appreciation over the years, and now as it sits at an expensive valuation, investors need to question the probability of achieving market-beating returns over the next five to 10 years. If you believe Apple can't outperform the indexes, then why own it? To be clear, I'm in the camp that believes the stock won't beat the Nasdaq Composite over the next decade. The main reason why I feel this way is due to Apple's poor growth trends. Revenue declined slightly in fiscal 2023, only to rise by 2.1% in the latest quarter (Q1 2024, ended Dec. 30).To be fair, many businesses are experiencing softer demand due to weaker consumer discretionary spending. That's understandable. Attention, then, should be turned to the longer term. Can Apple post strong top-line growth over the next several years? I think sales prospects are certainly weaker now than they were when Buffett first took a stake in the business.Apple is still overly reliant on the iPhone. This is arguably the single greatest product introduction in corporate history, and it has turned this company into a global technological and cultural icon. But currently on its 15th edition, the iPhone is in a very mature stage of its lifecycle. Upgrades these days aren't as revolutionary as they were years ago. This encourages consumers to delay buying the newest version, which is definitely not what Apple wants.Indeed, Wall Street analysts believe revenue and earnings per share will rise at compound annual rates of 4.4% and 8.3%, respectively, between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. In my opinion, that doesn't justify paying a historically steep valuation multiple.Of course, should the market continue to reward Apple with a high P/E ratio, then investors will be happy. But this is based purely on market sentiment, instead of fundamentals, so it's impossible to predict. Based on the facts, though, the odds of outsize returns going forward look to be slim.Unless Apple can find some way to supercharge its growth, that P/E multiple will likely gradually revert to its long-run average.

2024-03-28 11:13:43+00:00,"Global smartphone market set to rebound in 2024, report says","By Arsheeya Bajwa(Reuters) - Global smartphone shipments are expected to rebound 3% this year as easing inflation aids a demand recovery in emerging markets and the integration of generative AI attracts buyers to premium devices, a report by Counterpoint Research said on Thursday.Global shipments had declined more than 4% last year, earlier data from the research firm showed, as consumers tightened their purse strings in an uncertain economy.Emerging markets such as India, the Middle East and Africa are seen to be major growth drivers for the smartphone market, especially the budget-economy segment.The budget segment, expected to grow 11% in 2024 after shrinking in 2023, will also see increasing demand in the Caribbean and Latin American regions.The segment, consisting of phones priced between $150 and $249, is set to benefit from easing inflation in regions such as Africa and stabilization of local currencies, Counterpoint said.Increased competition between Chinese companies such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, along with a recovery in demand for IT devices, also aided growth in the segment.The premium segment, with phones priced between $600 and $799, is expected to grow 17%. The introduction of much-coveted genAI technology and the popularity of foldables will stimulate demand for this segment, the report said.Apple and Chinese rival Huawei are likely to emerge as winners in the premium market, it said.Steady demand for iPhones, particularly in emerging markets, is set to benefit Apple, while Huawei is expected to retain its strong presence in China, especially with the release of its 5G Kirin chipset, the report stated.Competition from Huawei led to a 24% decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of 2024, Counterpoint had estimated earlier.Separately, Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone, according to media reports from earlier in March.(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/global-smartphone-market-set-rebound-111343340.html
2024-03-28 10:45:00+00:00,"Cathie Wood Thinks Nvidia Could End Up Like Cisco After the Dot-Com Crash. Here's the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock That I'm More Worried About.","One of the most outspoken investors on Wall Street is Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest. Wood is best known for making big bets in emerging areas of technology and healthcare.In a shareholder letter published earlier this month, she suggested that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could end up like Cisco in the aftermath of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.Given the meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock price over the last year, it's reasonable to believe a pullback could be on the horizon. But calling for a crash akin to Cisco? That seems dramatic.Instead, I think a different ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could be at risk of falling out of favor with investors. Let's dig into why I see Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as much more likely to follow in Cisco's footsteps.Latent needs are an interesting concept. Simply put, a latent need is a problem that people don't even realize they have.Apple is the king of solving latent needs. With the iPod, iMac, iPhone, iPad, and AirPods, the company revolutionized personal computing, communications, and entertainment in ways that people didn't even realize were needed.The company's long list of innovative hardware made it one of the most recognized brands around the world.As investors salivate over all things related to artificial intelligence (AI), Apple is yet again remaining tight-lipped about its plans. I don't think this is the best move after some of the company's flops in recent history.Given how quiet the company has been on the innovation front, I think overcommunicating might be an appropriate strategy right now. Sure, it just shipped its virtual reality (VR) headset, the Vision Pro. But for now, I think people are more intrigued by the idea of VR, rather than the actual use of the technology in their daily lives.After years of playing coy, news broke earlier this month that the company was abandoning its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. And big tech cohorts Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all dominate cloud computing -- a movement that Apple missed entirely.Apple only recently made headlines in the AI realm following its acquisition of a start-up called DarwinAI. While this deal was interesting, details surrounding how it plans to leverage DarwinAI are sparse.By contrast, Nvidia is aggressively entering new AI markets that it can disrupt. For example, the company is an investor in humanoid robotics start-up Figure AI, as well as a partner with enterprise software platform Databricks.Among mega-cap tech companies, Nvidia is emerging as the front-runner in AI. Demand is soaring for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services.In 2023, Nvidia's revenue increased 126% year over year, while profits and free cash flow grew nearly sixfold. On the other hand, Apple's revenue has been in decline for a year as demand for luxury hardware devices has stalled against the backdrop of a tough economy.Cisco is one of the most interesting case studies in recent business history. The company was hailed as a leading innovator during the early stages of the internet age. But after competitors began producing similar products, Cisco failed to pivot and move on. Given Nvidia's broad reach across the AI spectrum, I find Wood's comparison to Cisco lacking.Sure, like Cisco back in the late 1990s, Nvidia stock soared to unprecedented levels. But I think the company's momentum is just getting started. The long-term narrative surrounding AI is encouraging, and right now the chipmaker appears to be the engine powering all sorts of applications.By contrast, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 -- higher than both Meta Platforms and Alphabet as of the time of this writing. It's tough to justify this premium when the company appears to be at a crossroads. It isn't growing, demand for its products is in decline, it abandoned EV's, and it doesn't appear to have any tangible strategy related to AI.Could competition ultimately pose a threat to Nvidia? It probably will. But this is why I find the company's investments in robotics and software to be savvy moves. It is clearly exploring markets beyond its core chip business, which will hopefully prove fruitful in the long run.Given the amount of unknowns surrounding Apple, I see the company as an enigma right now. As an investor, I'm not concerned about Nvidia's prospects. But given the lack of innovation from Apple for several years, I think there is a real possibility the company could end up in a situation similar to that of Cisco at some point.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-28 10:30:00+00:00,"2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Could Join Forces to Create the Ultimate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Opportunity","Most of the world's largest tech companies are feverishly developing artificial intelligence (AI) and placing the technology at the center of their businesses. The ""Magnificent Seven"" companies -- which include Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- are particularly active in the space.But Apple has been far quieter than its peers on the AI front. Instead, it spent the last few months launching the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which is the company's first new hardware platform since it released the Watch in 2015.But Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is in talks to integrate Alphabet's Gemini AI models into the next generation of its iPhone (potentially the iPhone 16). The deal -- if it happens -- could create the ultimate opportunity for investors.Alphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, DeepMind, and Waymo. The conglomerate has been developing AI for years, but that wasn't apparent in early 2023, when Microsoft agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Microsoft immediately integrated the technology into its Bing search engine. Investors feared it could threaten the dominance of Google Search, sending Alphabet stock plunging.Alphabet launched a ChatGPT rival called Bard, and the traditional version of Google Search now delivers responses to queries powered by generative AI. Bard was recently replaced by the Gemini large language model (LLM), which is Alphabet's response to OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models.Alphabet says Gemini outperforms GPT-4 across most multimodal benchmarks, which means it can interpret and generate text, images, videos, and computer code more effectively.Gemini is available as an add-on for many of Alphabet's customer-facing applications, including Google Docs and Gmail, and developers can also access it through Google Cloud to build their own AI products.Google pays Apple $18 billion each year to be the default search engine on its devices, which include the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Why? Because there are more than 2.2 billion of them in use worldwide. According to Statista, 96% of the global population uses a mobile device to access the internet, and smartphones account for about half the time we spend online.Deals like the one with Apple help Google's maintain its dominant 91.6% market share in the search industry.The same phenomenon will apply to AI. There are reports that Apple is also holding talks with OpenAI, and whichever AI provider the company selects to power its devices could instantly become the most widely deployed in the entire world.Apple isn't new to AI. Its Siri voice assistant is powered by the technology, as is the recommendation engine in Apple Music. Its latest iPhone 15 Pro is also fitted with the A17 Pro chip, which was designed to efficiently handle AI workloads on-device instead of in the cloud.Apple is building its own AI models in-house. However, its staunch approach to privacy means the company may not have the same amount of useful data as Google -- or perhaps isn't willing to use it -- to make those models competitive. That's speculation on my part, but outsourcing AI could be the more palatable option.Details are light on the scope of the potential deal, but Gemini could help Apple users rapidly craft messages and emails, as well as quickly generate image and video content. Plus, chatbots are a more convenient way to find information compared to traditional search engines, so Gemini could reduce the time users spend browsing the internet. Since that basically cannibalizes Google Search, it's even more important for Alphabet to win this deal.Apple needs Gemini to deliver advanced AI to users of the next-generation iPhone. Competing smartphones from Samsung (and even Google) are already miles ahead on that front. The Samsung Galaxy S24 introduced capabilities like Live Translate, which allows two people to converse in different languages over the phone, and Circle to Search, which recognizes image content to help users run search queries.Apple was the largest company in the world, with a $3 trillion valuation up until January. But it's now worth just $2.6 trillion, with Microsoft riding its own AI efforts to a $3.2 trillion market cap.Apple faces a few other issues like sluggish revenue growth, as well as a recent lawsuit from the Department of Justice that accuses the company of illegally monopolizing the market. The latter could challenge Apple's closed-ecosystem approach to the App Store and even the iOS operating system, but it will probably take years for the case to wrap up.An AI deal with Google could be worth tens of billions of dollars if the two businesses' existing search partnership is any indication. That will add some growth to Apple's top line, but more importantly, it could make the company the largest distributor of AI in the world.Google, on the other hand, needs Apple's vote of confidence to cement its leadership in AI after it fell behind in 2023. ChatGPT has over 180 million monthly users, but a deal with Apple would see Gemini eclipse that number by several orders of magnitude.If the two companies do reach an agreement, investors might want to own a stake in both, because it will easily be the biggest AI deal this industry has seen so far.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-28 10:00:23+00:00,Apple's services pivot has summoned the lawyers,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsApple's tough year just got worse.At first glance, it may seem curious that the Justice Department is targeting Apple's power in the smartphone market just as the company is trying to diversify from its marquee hardware. But Apple's eye-popping growth in services — its impressive ability to extract more revenue from the periphery of its ecosystem — drives much of the hostility against it.Sales of the iPhone still account for more than half of Apple's revenue. But the services that tie into the phone are amassing an increasingly important role in the company's business. For some of Apple's more bullish analysts, the promise of the services segment is the narrative fuel behind Cupertino's growth story and a pillar of its $2.6 trillion valuation.That also explains the company's strategic predicament. As Apple leans more heavily into generating value by keeping people within its system — from things like App Store commissions and subscriptions — the more scrutiny it draws to its business practices.The antitrust suit is the latest challenge weighing on the company's share price, which has flagged in recent months, in part on slowing iPhone sales in China.Tech's growth narrative has finally shifted away from phones/apps to AI, a theme aptly illustrated by Bank of America Global Research analysts who wrote Wednesday that their recent trip to Asia was the first trip in two decades ""where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation.""Services might be a long-term financial solution to the waning importance of the iPhone. It's also an invitation for regulators to investigate monopoly power and test the strength of the ""Walled Garden,"" as Apple's closed ecosystem is often called.To Apple, the seamlessness of the iPhone experience reflects the security of its products and the vibrance of its offerings, a message it is counting on Steve Jobs disciple Phil Schiller to affirm. Riffraff does not make it past the App Store's front desk, and Apple will not lend out jackets to any shady developers who show up flaunting the club's rules. And like any club, its success comes from the members sticking around.But to the users and developers aggrieved by the company's practices (high club dues!) the walls are a means of exclusion. And even worse, that walled garden isn't just keeping people out — it's keeping people in.Much of the conflict hinges on interpreting convenience or confinement, of attempting to prove loyalty or lock-in. Perhaps a drawn-out courtroom battle will spell out the spoils of Big Tech's conquest: that years later, people can't tell the difference.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

2024-03-28 08:05:00+00:00,Apple Stock Is About to Get Dangerously Close to Its 52-Week Low (and It Doesn't Even Have to Go Down),"Investors in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are not having a good 2024. The stock is down over 10% year to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up over 9%.It's difficult for such a heavily weighted stock to underperform the broader benchmarks by that much in a short time. But Apple is dealing with several very real challenges and has largely missed out on the tech rally that is being fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).As of March 22, Apple is now just 10.5% away from its 52-week low during a time when many other tech stocks are setting new all-time highs. Here's why Apple is about to get even closer to its 52-week low even if the stock stays where it is, and whether you should buy it now.Apple's current 52-week low of $155.98 was reached on March 28, 2023. As the calendar rolls on, Apple's new 52-week low will get higher even if the stock price doesn't move. After May 4 (and assuming Apple doesn't go below this point), the new 52-week low will be $165.67 from Oct. 26, which is less than 5% below where Apple currently trades. By comparison, the stock's 52-week high of $199.62 occurred more recently, on Dec. 14, and it nearly exceeded that high just a couple of months ago in late January.A stock's 52-week lows and highs are merely ranges, but they do signal if investors are optimistic or pessimistic. Apple is already closer to its recent low than its high, but it will get much closer to the low with time.On a favorable note, it's worth mentioning how steady Apple has been. There is only a 20% swing from its 52-week high and the late-October low, meaning it has not been a volatile stock. Its 4.1% sell-off on March 21 was the largest single-session drop since Aug. 4. You would be hard-pressed to find a big tech stock that hasn't fallen more than 5% in a session in over a year.As consistent as Apple has been, there are concerns that the investment thesis is weakening, setting the stage for further selling pressure. The company has a high success rate when it comes to hardware and accessories. But its current product pipeline is the most uncertain it has been in over a decade.The company launched the iPad in January 2010. The Apple Watch, announced in September 2014, was initially met with skepticism but turned into a major hit. AirPods came out two years later in September 2016.Aside from new versions of existing products, there hadn't been a significant new product until the Vision Pro was unveiled in June 2023 and made available in the U.S. on Feb. 2.The company isn't in a new product and accessory drought, but the Vision Pro is unproven, and Apple simply hasn't come out with much else for a while now. Some of the uncertainty comes from within its existing ecosystem -- namely the iPhone.New iPhone models feature improvements, but there hasn't been a massive leap for several years. Some hoped that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max would be a turning point, but that hasn't been the case thus far, as iPhone sales growth has ground to a halt.Whether it's a lack of innovation or the fact that the upgrade cycle is getting longer, the product and accessory portfolio looks particularly vulnerable right now. That all could change in a heartbeat if the Vison Pro becomes a resounding success, Apple launches an AI-enabled iPhone that is welcomed by users, or a lot of folks who bought new products during the height of the pandemic decide to upgrade.In sum, it's still too early to sound the alarm on Apple's innovation glut, but there are cracks that are beginning to form.Trailing diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up just 4.2% over the last two years. And judging by analyst estimates, the growth isn't going to return in the short term.Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 26.8, and its forward P/E is 26.3. Apple reported its 2024 first-quarter earnings for the period ended Dec. 30, 2023. Average analyst EPS estimates for the full fiscal year are $6.56.Growth is expected to tick up in fiscal 2025, with average earnings estimates of $7.16 per share, 9% higher than fiscal 2024. But those results won't fully materialize until Apple reports its 2025 full-fiscal-year results in February 2026 -- a long time to wait.Single-digit EPS growth is a negative outlook for Apple, especially because a few percentage points are due to buybacks. So, taking that out, forecasts are really only calling for net income growth in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2025, which would imply little improvement in product sales and next to no growth from the Vision Pro.And these forecasts don't even factor in the risks from the recently announced lawsuit against Apple by the Department of Justice. The suit targets the company's services more than its products and could compress margins for what has been a bright spot in an otherwise cloudy period.When an excellent industry leader with an impeccable brand faces negative sentiment, a gloomy outlook, and other challenges, it is usually a good buying opportunity even if the stock goes down more in the short term. There are countless examples of this dynamic playing out across multiple industries.Big tech stocks got clobbered in 2022 and staged an epic recovery in 2023. This year, the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't Salesforce or Amazon or Microsoft -- it's Walt Disney, which had underperformed the market for multiple years but is up 28% in less than three months.With challenges compounding, I expect Apple to break to a new 52-week low, especially once the margin narrows between its current price and the new higher one-year low after March 28. But the more Apple falls, the better value it will become for long-term investors.The stock is worth buying now, but investors should closely monitor the performance of the Vision Pro and watch for updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference (usually early June) and its annual Apple Event (usually early to mid-September).Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Shares took off this month as its strong quarterly earnings fueled optimism over demand for the company’s AI servers.The AI craze has brought big gains in companies like Nvidia Corp. as investors see massive growth potential for the sector. Hon Hai’s AI server revenue is likely to reach 18% of its total revenue in 2025 due to the rising share of Nvidia shipments, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note Wednesday.To be sure, Hon Hai’s total revenue exposure to AI is likely to remain at 10% to 12% this year, compared with about 20% for its competitors like Wiwynn Corp., Quanta Computer Inc. and Wistron Corp., according to a JPMorgan note earlier this month.The rally may have gotten excessive, as Hon Hai is now among the most overbought stocks on Taiwan’s benchmark index in terms of 14-day relative strength, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The stock has advanced 49% so far this year in spite of Apple’s slowing sales in China.Still, analysts see the positive story for Hon Hai continuing, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. all lifting their price targets for the stock this month. JPMorgan analysts raised the target by 21% to NT$170 this week.Ramp-ups for AI servers and EVs are key drivers for Hon Hai in 2024, Goldman analysts including Allen Chang wrote in a note, adding that the firm’s valuation is still attractive given stronger earnings growth ahead.

2024-03-27 21:13:14+00:00,Troubles mount for Apple as WWDC nears,"As Apple (AAPL) prepares for its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, the tech giant finds itself wrapped in a series of negative headlines. Apple is currently facing an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice, grappling with declining iPhone sales in China, and encountering price cuts for iPhones at authorized retailers.In the midst of these challenges, Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details and provides insight into what is expected at the highly anticipated WWDC conference.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJOSH LIPTON: Apple taking a hit so far this year as it comes to face with several potential headwinds. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley with more on the troubles biting into Apple and what may be ahead for the tech giant. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Josh, it felt more like a bad year than a bad quarter for Apple with all the different news that's come out. The latest is that iPhone sales in China were down 33%. That's according to Chinese government data. Bloomberg had reported on that.Before that, counterpoint research had reported in the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales that have fallen 24% year-over-year. Now, overall, smartphone sales in China had fallen 7% at that point, but still it's worth noting that fall in China itself. Part of that has to do with the economic conditions there. Part of it has to do with the rise of a resurgent Huawei, as well as a huge boost in iPhone sales that had happened in 2023 is a holdover from 2022 when there were some factory issues. But still, it's important to point that out, as well as the fact that Apple authorized retailers are cutting prices on some iPhones, the iPhone 15, the latest iPhone. And that's according to the South China Morning Post.But it's not just the iPhone. There's also the obvious 800 pounds gorilla in the room, the battle with the DOJ, that huge antitrust trial, or antitrust lawsuit, rather, that the DOJ filed. Apple is going to have to fight that.One of the key issues that is worth noting is that the bigger problem may not be to specific business sectors, but to Apple's attention. And so, you know, Bill Gates has famously said that if they didn't have the antitrust suit going on at Microsoft in the '90s and early 2000, they might not have missed the boat on mobile.Remains to be seen hindsight's 2020, what have you. They did try to launch their own Windows phone. Nobody's using one now. So that tells you how well that went. But it is something that I think is worth pointing out about the attention.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and then that gives us the opportunity to talk about some of the products and upgrades that we might see at the worldwide developer conference which is in June. I believe June 10th. What can we expect this year? Anything big?DAN HOWLEY: So the big thing is going to be-- it's got to be AI. We had seen that some inkling and hints of it in some of the discussion on AI. There's the a tweet by Jos, who had said that it will be absolutely incredible WWDC. So capital A, capital I.Obviously, wouldn't do that when you look at the rest of the case that he's used there. So that's a clear call out that AI is going to be the big thing.Now, there's two reasons for that. One is maybe they're going to have a whole bunch of cool new AI stuff at WWDC. The other is to notify Wall Street that, look, we know what's going on. We know that you guys are talking about this. So we're thinking about it. And there's going to be something.JOSH LIPTON: What would surprise you, Dan, when it comes to-- would it be like is it going to be like a bigger better Siri? I mean, what would surprise Dan Howley, as you're watching it?DAN HOWLEY: I mean, if Siri could do better, in general, that would be great. But I think opening up generative AI on the iPhone could mean a lot more exploring without having to open up apps. I think that would be something interesting if they get the voice aspect of that going.Now, OK, that could also lead to more conversation about antitrust and Apple blocking out competition.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. For sure.DAN HOWLEY: But still, I think the phones now are displays, cameras, batteries. That's what people want to know about. We've seen some camera apps that have gotten generative AI with Google and Samsung. If Apple's going to just tread that same road, it's not going to be all that interesting, unless they manage to do something more than like I take a picture of myself and make it look like I can dunk a basketball. That's what you can do with GenAI on Google's phones and Samsung's. Apple's got to do a little bit more to really get people jazzed up about.JARED BLIKRE: Cinematic virtual dunking of a basketball.DAN HOWLEY: Also, just make me be able to dunk a basketball. Maybe that. Makes me taller. I mean, you know.JOSH LIPTON: All right. We'll put that on Tim Cook's agenda. We'll see. What happens, Dan?DAN HOWLEY: Anything's possible. Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: Who knows? Thank you, Dan.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/troubles-mount-apple-wwdc-nears-211314671.html
2024-03-27 20:17:15+00:00,Apple’s first quarter has felt more like an entire (bad) year,"Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a “difficult” period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.The company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it’s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it’ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it’s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).All of that is hurting Apple’s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.Suffice it to say, Apple’s 2024 is not going well.Apple’s latest headache came Tuesday, when Bloomberg, citing Chinese government data, reported that iPhone shipments fell 33% year over year in the country in February.China is Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the region accounted for $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in total revenue. That’s roughly 19% of the company’s sales.And this isn’t exactly out of the blue. Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone sales fell 24% year over year through the first six weeks of 2024 in the country. Overall smartphone unit sales in China declined 7% during the same period.Apple has been aggressively expanding in China for years, but a resurgent Huawei and difficult economic conditions in the country are squeezing device sales. The company isn’t just sitting idly by, though. Last week, CEO Tim Cook flew to China for the opening of the company’s latest flagship store in Shanghai. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing and was expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.According to the South China Morning Post, Apple-authorized retailers are also trying to goose sales, cutting the price of the company’s latest iPhones in the hopes that it will get consumers to start buying again. However, it might take more than lower prices to make that happen.Outside of Apple’s China sales drama, the company is also facing its long-anticipated antitrust fight with the Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which the DOJ filed last Thursday, accuses Apple of illegally maintaining dominance over the premium smartphone market by pushing aside competing apps and devices.The Justice Department claims that Apple imposes restrictions on app developers, makes it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms, and hinders cloud gaming and so-called super apps that allow users to access multiple smaller apps from one larger platform.Apple, however, is fighting back, saying in a statement that the suit ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""The DOJ is seeking to force Apple to change its business practices, which could mean giving third-party apps greater access to the company’s platforms and requiring Apple to expand compatibility with third-party device makers.The lawsuit could also prove to be a dangerous distraction for Apple similar to how Microsoft’s antitrust battle in the 90’s stole executives’ attention away from emerging technologies like smartphones. If Microsoft hadn’t been so invested in its antitrust fight at the time, there’s a good chance it would have seen the smartphone age coming as did Apple and Google, and launched its own line of handsets.In addition to slowing iPhone sales in China and the DOJ’s antitrust suit, the European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission on Monday, announced that it is looking into whether Apple is in compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act.In a statement released Monday, the Commission said it is investigating Apple’s new app fee structure in the EU as well as whether it meets user choice obligations related to default apps and the ability to delete preinstalled apps.The Digital Markets Act requires Apple to open up the iPhone to third-party app stores, enabling developers to get around the 30% and 15% fees the company charges for sales through its own App Store. While Apple said it will allow those third-party stores, the company said it will also charge developers a 50 euro cent Core Technology Fee per install per year on apps that have been installed more than 1 million times in the last 12 months.In a statement, the EC said it is looking into whether Apple’s new fees defeat the purpose of the obligations of the Digital Markets Act.While Apple is certainly facing a slew of challenges, it’s far from down and out. It’s still the second-richest company in the world by market capitalization — behind Microsoft — and it’s sure to continue to sell millions of devices and services subscriptions throughout the year ahead.Still, for the foreseeable future, Apple could be in for a bumpy ride.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

While Apple tends to keep its product development close to the vest, CEO Tim Cook signaled at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in February that it has been making big investments in generative AI and plans to disclose more later this year.The week-long conference will have opportunities for developers to connect with Apple designers and engineers to gain insight into new tools, frameworks and features, according to the company's announcement.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-announces-worldwide-developers-conference-144634204.html
2024-03-27 14:00:02+00:00,Why Apple Is Missing From Berkshire Hathaway's Permanent Holdings List,"Earlier this month, I discussed some key takeaways from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s 2023 letter to shareholders. One of the main points covered was that the guru added Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and the five Japanese conglomerates to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) permanent holding list. However, he did not express his intention to indefinitely hold Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is currrently the conglomerate's largest holding.Since then, I have been pondering why the tech giant is not a permanent holding for Berkshire Hathaway. In this discussion, I will share my preliminary thoughts on the subject.First of all, if we look at Berkshire Hathaway's history, it is not hard to tell that while Buffett has bought many stocks, he only held a handful of them for more than 10 years. According to Markets Insider, his holding period for the 10 longest-held stocks range from 15 years to 35 years (I added 1 year to the holding period as the article was written in 2023). Of these 10 stocks, Buffett still held some such as BYD (SZSE:002594). However, there are only two stocks that he has explicitly said Berkshire will hold indefinitely, namely Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).Buffett's steadfast commitment to these two companies says a lot about his confidence in the resilience of their business models and growth prospects. This observation raises the question of the distinction between Berkshire's permanent holdings and non-permanent holdings. In order to answer this question, I revisited Buffett and Charlie Munger's four criteria and came up with a similar list for permanent holdings.We all know Buffett and Munger's four criteria for making an investment decision:an understandable businessfavorable long-term economicsable and trustworthy managementa sensible price tagHowever, it's important to clarify that these four filters serve as guidelines for making initial purchase decisions, not for permanent holdings. Obviously, the criteria for permanent holdings are different.In my view, the fundamental distinction between a permanent holding and a non-permanent holding is whether the business requires an able and trustworthy management to maintain its moat. In fact, both Munger and Buffett have often said that it is best to ""invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will."" Compared to understandability and favorable long-term economics, idiot-proof is a much higher standard.As for American Express and Coca-Cola, I am not sure whether the former qualifies as an ""idiot-proof"" business. In my view, the card company is quite complex, which make it more vulnerable to mismanagement. On the other hand, Coca-Cola, with its iconic brands and a widespread distribution network, seems to possess the characteristics of an idiot-proof business.Another possible criterion for a permanent holding is a track record of dividend increases and share repurchases. Coca-Cola has raised its annual cash dividend for 62 consecutive years and its initial share repurchase program began in 1984.Now we can attempt to list Berkshire's criteria for permanent holdings:an understandable businessfavorable long-term economicsidiot-proofa track record of dividend increases and share repurchasesWith the above four criteria, we can evaluate whether Apple qualifies as a permanent holding.First, Apple's products are widely popular and have a loyal customer base. However, it still operates in the tech industry, which is notorious for the constant need for innovation. The dynamic nature of the industry makes it very hard to assess the long-term understandability and moat of the company's business as it must continuously adapt to evolving technologies and consumer preferences to maintain its competitive edge.Second, Apple is most likely not idiot-proof. We can gain valuable insights into this aspect from the company's own history. When Steve Jobs was forced out in the 1980s, then-CEO John Sculley almost led to the company's demise. Apple was reborn after Jobs came back and reinvigorated the business. However, it is noteworthy that Berkshire Hathaway did not invest in the stock during his tenure as CEO. Buffett made the decision to purchase Apple shares years after Jobs' passing, following his observation of Tim Cook's exceptional operational capabilities and astute capital allocation decisions. This clearly indicates that Buffett does not consider Apple's business to be idiot-proof.In terms of capital allocation, according to Apple's investor relation website, the company has been paying out a cash dividend since 1987 and has increased payments in most years. However, its share repurchase program is relatively new as the company only started to repurchase shares in 2012, after Cook's succession to the role of CEO. Interestingly, Buffett said that Jobs refused to buy back shares after consulting with him. This suggests his inability to effectively deploy capital was one of the key reasons why the guru did not invest in Apple during Jobs' tenure. At this point, it is unclear whether Apple can sustain its smart capital allocation strategy after Cook's eventual retirement.The rapid pace of technological advancement and the potential change in capital allocation decisions after Cook's tenure are two major potential hurdles for Apple to remain in Berkshire's portfolio for the very long term. Therefore, while Apple possesses many of the characteristics of a very high-quality business, it is still an unlikely candidate for Berkshire's permanent holdings list.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/why-apple-missing-berkshire-hathaways-140002070.html
2024-03-27 14:00:00+00:00,Apple Just Suffered Its Largest Single-Session Drop in Over 7 Months. Here's What It Means for the Stock,"On March 21, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1%, marking the worst single-session drop since it fell 4.8% on Aug. 4, 2023. The sell-off last August was in response to Apple's fiscal 2023 third-quarter earnings. But this latest sell-off had nothing to do with quarterly financial reports.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple for monopolizing smartphone markets. Here's what the DOJ said and why it's yet another piece of bad news weighing Apple down.Big tech companies like Apple are no strangers to antitrust threats. However, as Apple has grown in value, it has become a bigger target.The DOJ's 88-page document is chock-full of helpful context, including how Apple purposely built a system to protect itself from competition. ""If you read our lawsuit, what you'll see is that our concerns are not necessarily with what Apple is doing with Apple's products; our concerns are with restrictions when Apple tells others what they can and can't do with their products. That is our primary area of concern and that is the primary area of focus in our lawsuit,"" said Jonathan Kanter, assistant general for antitrust, in an interview with CNBC on March 22.To quote the seventh point from the DOJ's report:Apple's smartphone business model, at its core, is one that invites as many participants, including iPhone users and third-party developers, to join its platform as possible while using contractual terms to force these participants to pay substantial fees. At the same time, Apple restricts its platform participants' ability to negotiate or compete down its fees through alternative app stores, in-app payment processors, and more.Whether you agree or disagree with the suit, the danger is that it targets Apple's high-margin services segment, which has been the saving grace of an otherwise low-growth period for Apple.Apple has expanded its services offering to fuel growth despite sluggish product sales. The company still relies heavily on selling devices -- particularly iPhones. But the business model is still effective as long as Apple is adding users across devices and boosting engagement with services to enhance the Apple ecosystem. Services include iCloud, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple Podcasts, Apple Pay, and more.For its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), Apple reported 11.3% year-over-year growth in services revenue but just a 0.1% increase in products revenue. The high-margin services segment contributed to all-time-high diluted earnings per share and a 10-year high quarterly gross margin of 45.9%.Despite the strength of its services, Apple would be nothing without app developers. Just imagine if Meta Platforms' Instagram wasn't on the iPhone. This absence would degrade the utility of an iPhone, but because of Apple's dominance, it would be even worse for Meta Platforms.Apple's best argument is that developers need Apple more than Apple needs them. But overall, Apple can't succeed without third-party developers. There are valid points that Apple is overcharging for its services. A good example is Apple Pay. To quote the DOJ report:Apple also uses its smartphone monopoly to extract payments from banks, which need to access customers that use digital wallets on iPhones. Since Apple first launched Apple Pay -- long before it achieved meaningful adoption -- Apple has charged issuing banks 15 basis points (0.15 percent) for each credit card transaction mediated by Apple Pay. Payment apps from Samsung and [Alphabet] Google are free to issuing banks. Apple's fees are a significant expense for issuing banks and cut into funding for features and benefits that banks might otherwise offer smartphone users. The volume of impacted transactions is large and growing.In some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success, but that's the nature of antitrust suits. Apple provides more value to its users than ever before, but it will continue to face scrutiny the more it enters new industries like mobile payments.The DOJ lawsuit is yet another thorn in Apple's side, especially because it targets the highest growth segment of Apple's business. The lawsuit doesn't break the investment thesis. Still, it could eventually lead to margin compression for Apple.Apple's other key issues right now include slowing global growth, particularly in China. Apple has also failed to make a splash in artificial intelligence and has largely missed out on the gains that have rippled throughout the tech industry as a result of that theme.If Apple stock were crushing the market and expensive, then there would be cause for concern, but that simply isn't the case.Apple is down over 11% year to date compared to a 9% rally in the Nasdaq Composite -- a substantial underperformance considering Apple is the second-largest component in the Nasdaq behind Microsoft. Zoom out further, and Apple is down over the past six months and up less than 10% over the last year.Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now just 26.6, a discount to the S&P 500's multiple of 28.4. Apple has its challenges, but it's too good of a company to have a lower valuation than the broad market.Given its challenges, Apple stock could remain pressured in the short term, so there's no rush to dive headfirst into the stock. However, Apple has the qualities of an excellent long-term investment for patient investors, so it's worth opening a starter position, holding, or at the very least, adding to the top of your watch list.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-27 12:38:17+00:00,10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy,"In this article, we discuss 10 best momentum ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy. Momentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future.The renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again.In January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s “Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’. However, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on 'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing. Although, the rebalance at the end of Q1 2024 could pose a risk to momentum followers. Some of the top momentum stocks to buy include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, we discuss the best momentum ETFs in this article. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best momentum ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of March 26, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors.A view of the hustle and bustle of trading activity on a busy trading floor.5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 74.06%Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) is based on the Dorsey Wright Technical Leaders Index, comprising about 100 US companies from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. It utilizes a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC to select firms showing strong relative strength characteristics. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) expense ratio came in at 0.62%. The fund was launched on March 1, 2007. It ranks 10th on our list of the best momentum ETFs. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the top holdings of Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP). It is a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. On February 7, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $9.26, beating market estimates by $0.05, and a revenue of $3.83 billion, missing Street consensus by $30 million. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) was also a bottom contributor to portfolio performance. The Company reported +11% sales growth for the quarter, driven by a +17% increase in sales to professional service providers, leading to +12% growth in operating income and +17% increase in earnings per share. The Company – true to its long capital allocation culture – has aggressively bought back shares over the past 12 months. O’Reilly Automotive’s professional sales segment continues to dramatically outpace its publicly traded competitors. The Company has a mostly singular focus on the United States, whereas several of its competitors have diverted their attention away from the large and fragmented U.S. professional market, toward non-U.S. or non-automotive markets. In the short-term, investors are focused on the mild weather that has unfolded during the late fall and early winter of 2023. Mild weather often leads to temporary slowdowns in sales growth for auto parts, but we would look to take advantage of that because O’Reilly’s long-term competitive positioning and extraordinary returns on capital are well-entrenched.”5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 76.65%Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS) tracks the Dorsey Wright SmallCap Technical Leaders Index, which selects approximately 200 companies based on their market performance and relative strength characteristics according to a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 88.24%Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM) tracks the S&P 600 High Momentum Value Index, which comprises 120 securities from the S&P SmallCap 600 Index with the highest combined ""value scores"" and ""momentum scores"".

(NASDAQ:KELYA) is one of the top stocks for momentum investors. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 90.11%Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) employs a rules-based quantitative model to assess US common stocks, focusing on those with robust recent performance.

(NASDAQ:META) as a top pick, maintaining a Buy rating and a $575 price target on the shares.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Two additional trims, in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Carmax, were more substantive in nature. When Meta’s stock declined in 2022, we judged it to be significantly mispriced and held our ground through the bottom. We trimmed the position serially last year as the stock soared because we were wary of holding a large position exposed to significant regulatory risks, particularly in Europe. We are comfortable owning Meta at today’s much-reduced weighting and current valuation. The smaller position size reflects our updated assessment of the balance of long-term risk versus reward.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.  Suggested articles:20 States That Produce the Most Renewable Energy in the US20 Best Airlines in the World in 202414 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/10-best-momentum-etfs-buy-123817086.html

2024-03-27 10:00:00+00:00,Alphabet’s Triple Threat: 3 Things That Will Fuel GOOG Stock’s Upside,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) stock remains a top choice for long-term growth investors, for a number of reasons.The preeminent player in online search, Alphabet’s core Google business is core to its investment thesis. The company’s cash flow growth profile and durable profitability make it one of the safest Big Tech stocks to own for the long-term.The company’s recent shifts toward AI and machine learning are worth noting. Alphabet, with projects like TensorFlow, continues to integrate them into its core offerings, improving the user experience and increasing engagement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFollowing a recent Bloomberg report by analyst Mark Gurman, speculation arose regarding Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent negotiations with Alphabet regarding integrating Gemini into its devices.Whether this integration materializes remains uncertain, but underscores Gemini’s prominence in the AI landscape.The company’s machine learning extends to its Google Cloud division, offering AI and ML services to developers and enterprises. Its data warehouse, BigQuery, integrates advanced ML capabilities, enabling the analysis of 110 terabytes of data per second.This contributed to the division’s revenue growth from $13 billion in 2020 to $33 billion in 2023, solidifying Alphabet’s position as a top machine learning stock.Let’s dive more into why long-term investors remain bullish on GOOG stock.Wedbush included Google in its Best Ideas List, raising the firm’s target price on GOOG stock from $160 to $175 with an “outperform” rating. According to Wedbush, Alphabet could benefit from generative AI, dismissing concerns about risks to Google Search.Wedbush remains optimistic about Alphabet’s prospects despite its shares trailing behind competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the cloud arena.Analysts continue to find encouragement in Alphabet’s recent statements on generative AI and Google Search and reports of negotiations with Apple to integrate Gemini into future iPhone software updates.Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management expressed optimism about a potential deal between Google and Apple, stating that Google investors have eagerly anticipated this development for the past six months.Amid concerns about Google’s leadership and the perceived risk of AI to its search engine, CEO Sundar Pichai faced criticism for lacking vision, with reports of employee discontent and talent departing for competitors like Apple.Google’s challenges with its Gemini AI chatbot underscored the potential impact of AI on its search engine.With its dominant search engine, Alphabet has a symbiotic relationship with Apple. Despite paying billions to remain the default search option on iPhones, AI advancements could alter this dynamic.Talks of licensing Alphabet’s AI models to Apple signal a potential shift, granting Apple leverage in their partnership.Apple’s global dominance, with over 2.2 billion devices running its OS, solidifies its value in its search deal with Alphabet. iPhones contribute significantly to Google’s traffic and ad revenue, yielding up to $20 billion annually for Apple.However, the emergence of intelligent chatbots poses a risk. Apple needs to improve its service and may require substantial investment to catch up, estimating up to $5 billion in expenses for AI initiatives.Apple and Alphabet face a common challenge. Apple needs an AI service despite its extensive user base, while Alphabet’s Google Search, a significant revenue source, faces potential audience loss.Meanwhile, Alphabet’s AI project Gemini faced initial setbacks. Chatbot excitement boosted Microsoft’s stock, prompting discussions between Apple and OpenAI.However, negotiations with Alphabet hold promise due to Google’s vulnerability. Antitrust concerns loom large, given ongoing scrutiny of their partnership’s fairness, potentially complicating any potential deal.Analysts noted a shift in sentiment toward generative AI, citing management’s positive remarks on Google Search and media reports of negotiations with Apple to integrate Gemini into iPhone software updates.Experts also foresee potential catalysts if management addresses investor concerns promptly. They suggest more straightforward communication regarding the business model implications of search generative experience and feedback from early tests.Additionally, they highlight the potential for more aggressive cost re-engineering and continued enterprise momentum in generative AI use cases.Although part of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet’s stock has seen recent stagnation, with many taking a cautious approach to this company.I think that Alphabet’s stability via its core business, and its growth upside via its AI and machine learning integrations, makes this stock a compelling option at 26-times earnings right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-27 08:12:00+00:00,Apple's in Hot Water Over Its iPhone Dominance. Here's What Investors Should Know About Its Latest Antitrust Lawsuit.,"It's not often that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) sheds $100 billion of market value, but that's what happened on March 21.The Department of Justice and 16 state attorneys general sued Apple for monopolizing the smartphone market, adding to a long list of headaches for the iPhone maker, which is already struggling with headwinds in China and flat revenue growth. Apple also lost the title of the world's most valuable company earlier this year to Microsoft.The DOJ alleged that Apple has an illegal monopoly in smartphones in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Its complaints were far-reaching, arguing that Apple makes it harder for Americans to switch smartphones; undermines innovation in apps, products, and services; and imposes unjustified costs on developers, businesses, and consumers.The general argument against Apple should be familiar to investors who have followed big tech companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. These companies wield tremendous market power and the line can often be blurred between what's simply acting in their own best interest and what's illegally harming customers and a competitive marketplace.Let's take a closer look at the DOJ's lawsuit and the implications for Apple.Nearly all of Apple's revenue centers around the iPhone, including its services business and sales of products like Airpods and Apple Watches that are designed to work in tandem with the iPhone. The DOJ argues that Apple has extracted higher prices from consumers and imposed higher fees on developers and creators through a variety of anti-competitive tactics.Those include:Blocking innovative super apps. The DOJ says that Apple has blocked the growth of ""super apps"" like Tencent's WeChat or Alibaba's AliPay that range from payments to messaging to entertainment. According to the DOJ, Apple resists super apps because if those apps were able to offer subsidiary apps inside them, Apple would lose control of payments it now retains through the App Store.Suppressing cloud gaming platforms. The DOJ also says Apple suppresses cloud gaming services by making gaming platforms submit games individually, rather than include them all in one app. Apple recently reversed those restrictions, but the DOJ said that years of resisting cloud gaming means that none of those services are on the iPhone.Excluding cross-platform messaging apps. Apple limits functionality with messages from Android phones, according to the DOJ, and restricts video quality in order to push people to buy iPhones.Finally, the DOJ claims that Apple has limited the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, helping to lock Apple Watch buyers into the iPhone and vice versa, and it limits third-party payment capabilities. For instance, it allows the tap-to-pay feature to be used with Apple Pay, privileging its own product over competitors like PayPal.The DOJ isn't suing Apple for a specific amount. In the civil complaint, it says it is ""seeking equitable relief on behalf of the American public to redress Apple's long-running, pervasive anticompetitive conduct.""Thus far, regulators have mostly been ineffective in reining in the market power of big tech companies in spite of multibillion-dollar fines. Nearly all of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have recently reached all-time highs, though many have faced regulatory pressure. Apple, for example, was fined $2 billion earlier this month by the E.U. for blocking music streaming competition, including preventing Spotify from informing users of payment options outside of the App Store, through which Apple collects a 30% commission. Apple plans to appeal the ruling.Apple makes nearly $100 billion in net income a year so a fine is unlikely to deter the company or significantly impact the stock unless it's in the tens of billions of dollars.What could be more impactful is if the DOJ forces Apple to significantly change its business practices. This could jeopardize at least some revenue from its high-margin services business, which benefits from the 30% commission Apple is able to charge in part from some of the practices the DOJ says are monopolistic.A mortal blow to Apple's business seems unlikely, but investors should keep an eye on the case. Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Fortnite-maker Epic Games have been accusing Apple of anti-competitive practices for years, and a ruling against Apple could be more meaningful for the entertainment apps that depend on the iPhone.For now, the investigation isn't a reason to sell Apple stock, but it is the latest in a series of events that signal that Apple's best days could be behind it. With the stock still trading at a premium, Apple shares could head lower if it doesn't reassure investors that it's still on the right path.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-27 08:00:27+00:00,'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle,"Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): ""The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.""But not all legal experts agree that federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone.""My guess is [Apple] will win,"" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.Even if Apple does not prevail in the New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.""Yes, I think that Apple will prevail in the end.""The lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.The Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) — alleging they also violate antitrust laws.The case against Apple is the widest-ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.The tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government’s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.In broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products — including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps — on the iPhone.Apple said forcing it to open up the iPhone’s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design ""the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.""Central to that design, the company said, are privacy, security, and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.Harvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneier said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument, ""I think they win.""But there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company’s business model and not to the phone's design.""Apple does have more security because they don't spy on people for a living,"" Schneier said. ""They make the money on devices and electronics.""What's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneier.""Don’t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.""Some argue the government has a strong case.""I think it’s very well pleaded,"" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple’s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.There is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.One is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olson.To overcome those limits, Olson said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law.Unless the government proves the iPhone is an ""essential facility,"" Olson explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.Another challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.The market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.Then it must address a critical question: ""What have you done with your monopoly that’s problematic?” Picker said.The government’s answer is that Apple’s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products — like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.One potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than harm them.In fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega-popular gaming app “Fortnite,” Epic Games.It was a case that Apple mostly won.A federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.The Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olson said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.""It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,"" Olson said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.""It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.""Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled the names of Bruce Schneier and David Olson.

2024-03-26 21:48:14+00:00,OpenAI lawsuits are a 'bullish' signal: 'Like the early days of Facebook',"Wall Street investors are particularly bullish on tech as AI transforms many companies' operations. Following its market debut, Reddit (RDDT) outperformed expectations after positioning itself as an AI play. Bedrock Founder & Managing Partner Geoff Lewis joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how AI is disrupting various sectors in the market.Lewis focuses particularly on OpenAI and its possible future maneuvers. He compares the company's current legal situation to the ""early days of Facebook"" (META): ""Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I don't think we've ever seen either in the private markets a revenue ramp that's been this rapid.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- We're joined now by Jeff Lewis, founder and managing partner at Bedrock. Jeff, it is great to see you on the show. And maybe we'll just start there, Jeff. We talk about the engines driving this market. And we talk about the economy and the Fed. But for sure also, it's just all the excitement about AI, Jeff. I'm just curious how you see that technology evolving here, Jeff. In the near to intermediate term and which are the sectors the industries that you think are going to be disrupted?JEFF LEWIS: Yeah. Josh, great to be here. I mean, I think we're in a really exciting moment. I think lots is being disrupted. Everything from software engineering to medicine. We are major investors in OpenAI. And I do feel they are at this point clear mega platform that is powering this wave and partnership with Microsoft. But in general, I just think it's a massive, massive positive tailwind for technology broadly. You were talking a moment ago about GameStop.There's a sense in which that phenomenon back in 2021 was really powered by Reddit. And now it's come full circle, where you have Reddit surging 40% since IPO. And I think a lot of the enthusiasm around even Reddit is underpinned by what AI is going to be able to unlock for all of these technology platforms. So frankly feeling very bullish on tech broadly because of in large part AI and what it promises over the years to come.AKIKO FUJITA: Jeff, let's talk specifically about OpenAI then. I mean, we've been talking so much about the exuberance around AI. NVIDIA obviously a big beneficiary on the back of that. But OpenAI is not a publicly traded company. There's been a lot of debate about where this company goes from here. Given the foundation of how it started, how it's now a for profit company and that lawsuit coming through from Elon Musk recently. Where do you think OpenAI, as a business, moves from here?JEFF LEWIS: Certainly. Well, as a starting point I think lawsuits are always a really positive sign. And so when you have lots of different folks suing a company as you have that with the case of OpenAI. Publishers suing, you have Elon suing. That is just an incredibly positive sign. I think in the early days, Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. So I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year predominantly. With consumers, they've only recently launched offerings to enterprises.It's been publicly reported they're in worth of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I just don't think we've ever seen, in the private market, a revenue ramp been this rapid. And if you think about where private markets investors like myself, were at. Seven or eight months ago, there was a lot of questioning around some of these other LLMs going to really overtake OpenAI. The reality is they just haven't. And so if you look at the landscape of generative AI startups in the private markets today.The overwhelming majority of those companies are wrappers on GPT. So to me OpenAI is at this point the clear winner. The revenue ramp frankly speaks for itself. And the partnership with Microsoft does give it several unfair advantages as they go to market. With enterprises expand the product offering, the stuff they're doing now. Starting to work on now with Sora, partnerships with studios.I just think the range of markets that this company is going to impact is tremendously broad.- And Jeff, you mentioned how Musk is suing OpenAI. And his point seems to be, Jeff, you know I put time in here I put money in here with the promise it was going to be open source. How do you think that fight plays out?JEFF LEWIS: Well, no idea. I'm not a legal analyst. And certainly I would not ever want to be on the other side of a lawsuit with Elon. So it's hard to predict exactly what happens. But I think there are, some stuff's been released. And it seems as if all folks, including Elon in the early days all agreed that there had to be a for profit type model. They had to raise significant financing in order to maintain their lead.And so I think when-- we're going to see with the facts. The facts come out, but I imagine that it'll be a prolonged protracted lawsuit. And I don't quite know where it'll land. But I do think the meta point I'm trying to make is the lawsuits are a very positive sign. When something is powerfully working folks come out of the woodwork and sue.AKIKO FUJITA: Jeff, finally, I do have to ask you about what's playing out with TikTok. Obviously, the Senate now taking up a bill that essentially calls for a spin off of this company from its Chinese parent company. Let's say the spin off does happen. It moves in that direction. Is this a company you'd invest in? Is it a good buy? I mean, you've got everybody from Steve Mnuchin to Kevin O'Leary saying, look, if we're able to separate it from the Chinese parent company we want to buy in.JEFF LEWIS: I don't think that we personally at Bedrock would be interested in doing it. It's a-- the valuation will likely be extraordinarily high. And more importantly, my view on TikTok is that it's actually been very negative for society. Just even beyond the CCP element with the control from ByteDance. If you spend any time with young children these days, they're just completely addicted to it.And I personally, we're at a point here as investors at Bedrock we can invest in really whatever we want to. And we want to invest in things we think are making the world a little bit better. And I think TikTok is making the world a little bit worse. So not for me. But frankly I don't even think they're going to be able to pull off the divestment. I mean, if you look at how long it took Elon to buy Twitter. That was six months of highly motivated buyers. Took Facebook seven months to buy WhatsApp I don't see how you can do a transaction this big in six months.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Which is why this bill has been characterized as an effective ban, because of just how difficult that is. Jeff Lewis, Bedrock founder and managing partner. It's good to talk to you today. I appreciate the time.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/openai-lawsuits-bullish-signal-early-214814281.html

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what investors are expected to hear from the tech giant at its annual event.Wang notes that with Apple's extensive involvement in artificial intelligence, investors are eager to see how the company plans to incorporate AI into iPhones, stating, ""it hasn't always been explicit."" He mentions that with upcoming iOS upgrades across Apple's product lines, investors will be looking to understand how AI will ""bring Apple devices to life.""Wang emphasizes the importance of collaborations, suggesting that a potential partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) could be in the works. He believes it's crucial for Apple to demonstrate that ""they are part of that ecosystem."" Wang views this potential deal as ""one step towards the integration"" of AI more prominently at Apple. However, he believes that as time goes on, investors will see ""more partnerships emerge"" as AI integration develops further.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithAKIKO FUJITA: Apple has just announced it will be holding its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. Wall Street will be watching very closely as the Mag Seven tech giant sets out its latest developments in devices, most importantly listening out for any signs of its much promised AI strategy. Let's bring in our friend of the show, Ray Wang, an avid Apple stock watcher.Ray, I was just checking here. Apple stock down about 11.5% year to date, hasn't been a great start to the year. What are we expecting? What could be a potential catalyst for the stock coming out of this?R ""RAY"" WANG: I think the big question is, Apple has done so much in AI, what are they going to publicly talk about, and sell, and show, and just help developers see what they can do with AI inside the devices? It hasn't always been explicit. It's always been ambient happening in the background.And I think people are trying-- I mean, everyone watching is trying to figure out, hey what's going to happen in iOS 18, iPad OS 18, tvOS 18, Mac OS 15, watchOS 11? And that's really where the magic happens for Apple. It's like how the devices come to life.And I think how the devices come to life with AI is going to be a big area for a lot of investors to watch, as well as for a lot of Apple fans. I mean, there's 28, 30 million folks that actually watched the show last year remotely. And about a couple thousand-- I think it's like 5,000, 6,000 attend in person.JOSH LIPTON: Ray, what did you think of those reports we saw that Apple eyeing Google Gemini for future iPhones? What did you make of that?R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah, I think it's really important, right? There's a lot of things where they can actually have collaborations. It could be with Google.It could be with Microsoft. It could be the other folks. And I think it's important to show that Apple's part of that ecosystem across the board. And I also hope that the important piece is that Apple doesn't get distracted by this DOJ lawsuit.AKIKO FUJITA: Not distracted by the DOJ lawsuit, Ray, that's something that's likely to drag on for some time. But on that specific point about Gemini, I mean, what was your read on those reports that came out? Is it about Apple being a little further behind at least internally than what has been publicly reported or is this just one step that Apple already had in place to get to ultimately what they are working on internally, integrating that into their product?R ""RAY"" WANG: I think it's one step in towards integration into the product. I believe that those Google discussions have been happening for quite some time. And I think there's other discussions with other software vendors in terms of actually leveraging their capabilities. So whether it's something in collaboration, or it's something in video, or something that's going to be in terms of email, or something that's in other arts around the work and the enterprise environment, I think you'll see some of those partnerships emerge.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-investors-await-ai-clarity-212958097.html
2024-03-26 21:24:17+00:00,New Jersey AG lays out how Apple's practices hurt consumers,"Apple (AAPL) faces mounting regulatory pressures from both sides of the Atlantic: Department of Justice (DOJ) officials filed an antitrust lawsuit while European Union (EU) regulators probe Apple and other Big Tech companies for violating its Digital Markets Act.Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done:""What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, Apple's facing big antitrust lawsuits both here in the US and across the pond, with the Department of Justice here claiming that it is monopolizing the smartphone market, particularly when it comes to its App Store controls. 16 attorney generals joining the Justice Department in bringing the case forward, including our next guest, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.Good to talk to you today. Let me just have you walk you through your case here. I'm looking at the statement you put out saying specifically that Apple is in violation of the Sherman Act with its exclusionary and anti-competitive practices. What specifically is anticompetitive of the way Apple operates?MATT PLATKIN: Sure. Well, thank you for having me. I think as we lay out in the complaint, and I'm honored to join the Department of Justice and, as you said, 15 other states in filing this complaint last week, what we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform.And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers. So that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450.JOSH LIPTON: So I guess, Matt, I'm trying to understand-- so consumers are paying this much for an iPhone. But you know, Matt, I'm still trying to understand what the consumer harm is. If you look at customer satisfaction rates for iPhones, Matt-- and this isn't my opinion, I mean, we have the data-- they're off the charts, right? I mean, people love the iPhone, they buy it. Every September, Tim Cook introduces a new one, they buy that, too. And if they didn't want to buy it, they have alternatives, right? There are Android devices.MATT PLATKIN: Well, actually, as we allege in the complaint, Apple's practices have made it harder for people to switch off their platform. So they don't allow things like super apps on their platform, which would allow you to do multiple things in a cloud-based app, messages, purchase products, play games, the way you can on other platforms. On those apps, when they're cloud-based, you don't need the expensive hardware that an iPhone requires.That would allow you to switch to a lower cost platform. Apple has made it harder to do that. They don't allow tap to pay on there-- any wallet other than their own wallet. They don't allow third party app stores on their platform even though they're beginning to allow that in other markets. So there's a number of things that Apple has done that, yes, are people still purchasing iPhones. They are. 7 in 10 almost of every smartphone is an iPhone.But the reason-- a significant reason why people are staying on the iPhone platform is because Apple has deliberately made it harder for people to leave their platform by engaging in these exclusionary business practices.JOSH LIPTON: Well, that'll be your argument, Matt, but won't Apple say, listen, people stick with our iPhone because they're satisfied, because they're loyal, because they're happy with the product?MATT PLATKIN: Apple is free to make whatever arguments they want, but the facts are clear. When you see the practices that Apple has engaged in that other developers are not simply-- cannot do simply because they're not as big as Apple, it hearkens back to the practices we saw Microsoft engage in the 1990s when Apple was a lead witness in the Department of Justice and states' attorneys general case against Microsoft, that case is ultimately what allowed the iTunes platform to go on the Microsoft Windows platform, which led to the iPod and the iPhone.So Apple's very familiar with the playbook that Microsoft engaged in. Ultimately, Apple has largely adopted that playbook in our opinion.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/jersey-ag-lays-apples-practices-212417797.html

It’s going to be Absolutely Incredible! pic.twitter.com/YIln5972ZD— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) March 26, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsAs the name ""D"" in WWDC suggests, the event is heavily focused on developers for Apple's various operating systems. The event, which has most recently been held at the Steve Jobs Theater on the company's Cupertino campus, features several days of panels and workshops focused on its various ecosystems. The event also serves as a launching pad for said ecosystems. Anticipate big announcements around iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS 15 and watchOS 11, among others.Seeing as how this year's show will mark one year since the Vision Pro was announced, I would anticipate a LOT of new developers around the headset and its visionOS operating system. Updates to Apple Silicon and, perhaps, new Macs seem pretty likely as well.But Apple's AI plans will almost certainly take center stage at the show this time out. Responding to questions about the company's plans to catch up with generative AI offerings from top competitors like Microsoft and Google on its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” set to be announced later this year. WWDC seems like the most likely platform for such an announcement -- and, perhaps, details on a rumored Google Gemini partnership for the iPhone.Joz's sneaky backronym will no doubt only further speculation.Additional rumors have pointed to iOS 18 potentially being ""the biggest"" update in the operating system's long history. Rather than simply leaning into generative AI and being done with it, however, reports point to ""AI tools that help manage your daily life.""Certainly the notion of the AI smartphone isn't Apple specific. Samsung leaned heavily into the concept earlier this year with the launch of its Galaxy S24 line, which also relied on Google's Gemini efforts. The following month, Apple claimed that the new M3-powered MacBook Airs are the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI,"" mostly due to the neural processing units included in its first-party SoCs.Apple adds, ""Developers and students will have the opportunity to celebrate in person at a special event at Apple Park on opening day."" This is likely a reference to the news-filled keynote that traditionally kicks off the show. Of course, things remain dramatically scaled down since the pre-pandemic days at the San Jose Convention Center.As ever, the event will include a small cohort of ""winners,"" 50 of whom will be invited to the in-person event in Cupertino. The event follows soon after Google I/O (May 14-15) and Microsoft Build (May 21-24).The announcement arrives less than a week after the Department of Justice announced that it is suing the hardware giant over claims of monopolistic practices surrounding the iPhone.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/apple-wwdc-2024-set-for-june-10-14-promises-to-be-absolutely-incredible/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-wwdc-2024-set-june-171745379.html

The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google’s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features.As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race.Apple researchers also recently said they’ve developed a family of multimodal models — which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time — called MM1. A report from those researchers said those new methods boast “superior abilities” and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images.In a press release on Tuesday, the company said WWDC 2024 will also share software updates coming to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro headset.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-announces-annual-developers-conference-182025505.html

The company is also planning a minor refresh of the Apple Watch’s software and the first major update to the operating system running on the Vision Pro headset.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon ValleyTesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-set-unveil-ai-strategy-172610515.html
2024-03-26 17:13:34+00:00,UPDATE 2-Apple to hold Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10,"(Adds context in paragraph 3 through 6, background in paragraph 7)March 26 (Reuters) - Apple will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 10 to June 14, it said on Tuesday, amid reports that the iPhone-maker was in talks for AI partnership and could unveil significant changes to the iOS.The event, which will be available online, will highlight updates to the software powering iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices, the company said. Some developers and students will be invited in-person at Apple Park on the opening day, it added.Investors are closely watching for updates on artificial intelligence development at Apple, which has so far spoken little about incorporating the technology into its devices. The company earlier this year lost the crown as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft.Apple plans to use AI technology such as Google's Gemini for a chatbot within Apple's operating systems, while the iPhone maker's own AI engine will handle more behind-the-scenes tasks throughout the new software, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.The company also plans to make the iPhone home screen more customizable in iOS 18, which some reports have said could mark the biggest update to the iPhone operating system in years.The developers conference comes at a time when sales of Apple's iPhone remain weak, while those of Macs and iPads have fallen amid a worldwide slump in gadget sales.At last year's conference, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, a new core processor, and new computers.

2024-03-26 14:51:45+00:00,iPhone shipments declined by 33% in China in February,"According to figures reported by China's government and cited by Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipments have fallen around 33% in the month of February. The data comes as the company has met waning demand from the region, failing to maintain a competitive edge over Chinese smartphone manufacturers.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest developments on Apple's performance in China.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, China's lost its taste for Apple. That's at least according to new data analyzed by Bloomberg that shows iPhone shipments to China have fallen by a third compared to last year. Now Apple's been facing a number of issues in the country as it sees continued demand and low demand-- continued in low demand for its flagship device and its most important overseas market.That's not the only headwind it's facing. Dan Howley is here with more. And Dan, of course, we've got the bans in place for some of the government agencies. How much of that is leading to the declines we're seeing in iPhone shipments there?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it's hard to tell exactly, right? Those are limited to two government agencies. And, you know, there's far more consumers that would be able to buy iPhones than just government employees. But that 33% year-over-year decline, that's according to Bloomberg citing Chinese government data, is really stark.We had counterpoint research in the earlier part of this month saying that sales fell 24% in China for the first six weeks of 2024. Overall, smartphone shipments, though, it's worth pointing out, declined in China's 7% during the same period. So it's not just that Apple was declining, it's that other smartphone makers were declining.And then it's also important to point out that there was a large jump in sales around the same time last year because of pent-up demand during the end of 2022. And so it's a number of factors, but it's not looking very good as far as Apple goes, especially with the softer economy in China. We did see Huawei tick up pretty high. But again, that's because they were basically on death's door because of the US chip bans until they managed to get their own chips in place and start selling again.But it really-- it behooves Apple to get this under control. Obviously, they're aware of that. Tim Cook was there earlier this week going to the opening of the new flagship store in Shanghai and then meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to join other tech leaders in ensuring they're kind of positioning in the country.But overall, I mean, you look at a number like this of 33%, and then you look at the antitrust battle that you guys were just talking about, you look at the new potential investigation that the EU is launching as far as the Digital Markets Act against Apple as well as other major tech players. You match that up with the earlier part of this year, where we saw issues with the Apple Watch and the company having to take the blood oxygen sensor out of that. And it really is just this compounding number of problems that the company seems to be facing at this point.They just announced their WWDC event for June 10th. We're expected to see at least some kind of generative AI announcement. That's something that they've been woefully behind in. And that could prove to be a catalyst for them. But, you know, for a company that was riding high for so long, it's not doing poorly, by the way, still one of the richest companies in the world. But it's fallen behind Microsoft. And its stock has not been doing well so far this year. It's down more than 7% year-to-date and up just 6.25% over the last 12 months.You look at Microsoft, you look at Google, they're doing a heck of a lot better.JOSH LIPTON: Dan Howley, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/iphone-shipments-declined-33-china-145145033.html

2024-03-26 13:46:52+00:00,"iPhone Shipments in China Fell 33% in February, State Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. iPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.Most Read from BloombergLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth BillionsBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll ShowsJapan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990China Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest BanksTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest PeopleThe government figures showed foreign brands shipped only about 2.4 million smartphones last month, which was affected by the later timing of the Lunar New Year. Apple accounts for the vast majority of those shipments, as the only overseas player with a meaningful market share. The February decline marks a second consecutive month of lower shipments. In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units, or about 39% fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures.The shares dropped less than 1% in New York on Tuesday morning. They have declined about 12% so far this year, making Apple an outlier among its Big Tech peers.Cupertino, California-based Apple has seen its best-selling product struggle in the world’s biggest smartphone market since the September debut of its latest generation models.

2024-03-26 12:37:33+00:00,13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best affordable tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.On January 29, Fidelity Investments issued its outlook for the technology sector for 2024 and beyond. According to Fidelity, tech's performance in 2024 will depend on the macro environment to a certain extent. The outlook report noted that in 2023, tech finished the race as the top performer among all market sectors, a position it continued to occupy till late January of 2024, when it still outperformed the S&P 500. The biggest contributor to this has been coming from artificial intelligence (AI).Despite this, some financial professionals find it difficult to hop on the tech stock wagon, believing that most tech stocks are overpriced. For instance, on February 6, Bloomberg reported that Amundi SA, Europe's biggest fund manager, believes that the optimism in tech stocks is misplaced, resulting in the fund manager refraining from joining the ""big tech stocks frenzy."" Additionally, analysts at Bank of America Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been drawing parallels between the price levels of tech stocks today and the dot-com era bubble. As is the case with any bubble, it may be the case that this AI bubble, too, will soon burst.While this skepticism is also rising, many investors are still attracted to tech. On January 29, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, appeared on Bloomberg Radio to discuss this. His reasoning for tech stocks remaining an attractive investment is based on the following factors:""They have annuity-like businesses, they have pricing power, and they have global brands... the market views them as the stocks they go to. It's the all-weather stock.""Thus, the debate on whether investors should rush to buy tech stocks or avoid them for the moment continues. For those looking to buy into tech, there are some key areas they should look out for.According to Fidelity, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and cloud computing are the main areas to look at in the tech sector for investors today. Semiconductor companies have been investing in AI with increasing fervor since the launch of ChatGPT and, in some cases, even before then. The rise of AI has actually propelled semiconductor companies to greater heights since the use of their chips in AI applications has become practically essential. In the case of cloud computing, dedicated tech investors will know that this area of tech has been around and been popular for a long time. With companies and enterprises swiftly moving their data and workloads to the cloud, companies offering cloud-based software are gaining and retaining investor attention and money.All in all, tech may be a sector with a bright future. According to Deloitte's 2024 Technology Industry Outlook, global IT investments in 2024 are expected to see double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services. Additionally, analyst estimates show that public cloud spending will grow by over 20% this year, with AI investments also significantly contributing to increased overall spending growth for tech. Deloitte's outlook noted that by 2025, AI-related investments may reach $200 billion globally, with the US leading in this area.Considering the above, big-tech companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are considered to be the best investment picks this year. However, these companies are far from affordable for many investors, including many new investors. This is especially the case considering the skepticism concerning the perceived overvaluation of tech stocks in the market today. Hence, cheaper tech stocks with immense potential in today's market may be an excellent place to start your tech investment. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best affordable tech stocks to buy now. Our list includes some of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the tech stocks to buy that are too cheap to ignore.Our MethodologyFor our list of the best affordable tech stocks to buy, we used a stock screener to identify tech stocks with share prices below $50 and P/E ratios under 25.

2024-03-26 12:00:00+00:00,Best Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas of Last Week,"Wall Street delivered an upbeat performance last week due to dovish Fed cues. The S&P 500 added 2.3%, the Dow Jones advanced 2% and the Nasdaq rose about 2.9%.  There was growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates as the U.S. central bank sticked to its previous projections of three rate cuts despite recently-released hot inflation data.On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged and projected three rate cuts this year. During the news conference, Chair Powell acknowledged that inflation had been more persistent than expected over the past two months but expressed hope that inflation was on a sustainable path back to 2%.The central bank expects solid economic growth and the unemployment rate to remain at a low level. Powell noted that a strong job market wouldn’t deter the central bank from reducing rates. Stocks soared after the press conference.While technology stocks – being high-growth in nature – continue to perform well, the rally has broadened, with a clear resurgence in mid- and small-cap stocks recently. The financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain.The Magnificent Seven - Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year, per a Reuters article.BoJ (Bank of Japan) hiked its short-term interest rates to around 0% to 0.1% from -0.1%, according to its statement at the end of its two-day March policy meeting. It marked the first rate-hike in 17 years, putting an end to the world’s only negative rates regime on signs of robust wage gains this year. Japan’s negative rates regime had been in place since 2016 (read: BoJ Ends Negative Rate Era: ETFs to Win).Apple shares fell 2% last week as the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging the iPhone giant used its power over app distribution to block innovations, resulting in higher prices for consumers.Earlier this week, Google shares surged on reports that the company was in talks with Apple to bring its Generative AI engine, Gemini, to iPhones. Apple was also reportedly in negotiations with ChatGPT parent OpenAI. Alphabet shares gained 1.4% last week.Investors have expressed concerns that Apple has fallen behind in the AI race. CEO Tim Cook announced that the iPhone maker would introduce new generative AI capabilities later this year.While the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract billions in inflows, Grayscale's GBTC has recorded outflows of more than $12 billion since it was converted into an ETF, mainly due to its high fees. Grayscale is now planning a ""mini-me"" version of GBTC, which will come with a lower expense ratio.Meanwhile, bitcoin has logged a meaningful pullback last week, falling more than 10% from its all-time high, as interest in fledgling spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) moderates. JPMorgan Chase and Co. strategists caution that the retreat may not be over yet, per Bloomberg (read: Is Bitcoin Euphoria Waning? ETFs to Gain).Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETF areas of last week.MarijuanaAdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF MSOX – Up 16.7%In a White House meeting, Vice President Kamala Harris last week urged the DEA to expedite the rescheduling of marijuana, criticizing its current Schedule 1 classification as ""absurd"" and ""patently unfair.""

The Fed also indicated about the possibility of 75 bps of rate cut in 2024, propelling the demand for rate-sensitive homebuilding sector. Moreover, despite higher rates and home prices, existing home sales surged in February.Bull NvidiaGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL – Up 14.5%One highly anticipated event of the week was Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC).

2024-03-26 11:49:09+00:00,20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees,"In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paid CEOs in the US and their college degrees. We have also discussed the relevance of college degrees with CEOs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees. In a dataset of 2,600 CEOs, 8% lacked a college degree, a surprising finding given the rising demand for academic qualifications in the job market. Currently, one-third of positions that previously mandated only a high-school diploma now require a four-year college degree, with one in four roles that once sought a bachelor’s degree now demanding a master’s. Concurrently, 75% of Americans perceive higher education as financially unattainable. CEOs without degrees get to leadership roles through different avenues. Firstly, many arose from within their respective industries or companies, possessing specialized knowledge and extensive experience in their niche domains. Secondly, they demonstrate exceptional performance, particularly prevalent in sectors like sales where achievements are quantifiable and conspicuous. Lastly, they excel in assembling talented teams, relying on their insights and expertise to drive success.The relationship between undergraduate degrees and CEO success varies across industries. While tech sectors often require specialized education, other industries show a broader range of educational backgrounds among CEOs. The significance of pursuing a BA, BS, or BBA in attaining CEO positions remains unclear beyond industry-specific norms. In analyzing the educational backgrounds of Fortune 100 CEOs, it's evident that undergraduate degrees play an important role in shaping career trajectories. The most common degrees among CEOs are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), with 53% holding one of these degrees, while 47% have Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. Notably, 45% of those with BS degrees pursued business-related fields rather than traditional science or engineering disciplines.It is also worth highlighting that among the 2023 Fortune 100 CEOs, merely 11.8% obtained undergraduate degrees from Ivy League schools, with even fewer holding Ivy League MBAs. The success stories of CEOs like Doug McMillon of Walmart, who graduated from the University of Arkansas, confirm the value of performance over prestige in the corporate world. Furthermore, the prevalence of CEOs from public universities, such as Tim Cook of Apple Inc (NASDSAQ:AAPL) and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, highlights the accessibility of success beyond Ivy League corridors.Nevertheless, tech industry CEOs predominantly hold undergraduate degrees directly related to engineering. Examples include Tim Cook's degree in industrial engineering and Larry Page's in computer engineering. However, exceptions exist, such as CEOs like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, who hold degrees in history despite leading financial institutions.Speaking of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), let’s look at their latest financial performance. In the annual report for the year 2023, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) demonstrated strong financial performance across its business segments. The firm's Global Banking & Markets segment retained its leadership, achieving milestones such as maintaining the top rank in advisory net revenues for the 21st consecutive year and securing prominent positions in equity and debt underwriting. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) excelled in Equities and FICC, achieving its second-highest net revenue year since 2010. This performance translated into tangible growth, with financing revenues across FICC and Equities witnessing a 15% compounded annual growth rate since 2019, reaching nearly $8 billion in 2023.For investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) showcased impressive returns over the past five years. Book value per share increased by approximately 50 percent, outperforming peers, while the stock price increased by around 130 percent, compared to an average of approximately 60 percent among peers. Furthermore, the quarterly dividend more than tripled during this period.  Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024 and beyond, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) remains focused on key priorities outlined by its leadership, including serving clients with excellence, being an employer of choice, and delivering strong shareholder returns. On the other hand, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) faced a downturn in profits, primarily due to $3.7 billion in one-time charges and a decline in interest income as it invested more to retain customer deposits. Despite this setback, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives remain optimistic about the US economic landscape, highlighting consumer resilience. The financial performance of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) garnered mixed reactions from analysts. While the bank managed to exceed estimates by reporting a profit of 70 cents per share, excluding one-off charges, some analysts noted its underperformance compared to peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Despite challenges in this domain, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) exhibited strength in other areas, such as trading and investment banking.Looking ahead, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) anticipates modest growth in loans, expecting a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in 2024. However, the bank foresees continued challenges in net interest income, projecting a decline in the first and second quarters before a potential recovery in the latter half of the year.A successful CEO in a modern office with a sweeping view of the financial district.To list the highest paid CEOs in the US, we relied on data compiled by the AFL-CIO Executive paywatch about annual compensation of CEOs in the US. We then looked at the individual profiles of these CEO’s through their business websites or official linkedin to identify their college degrees. Please note that we excluded two names from our list i.e, Austin Russell and Tomer Weingarten. Austin Russell was a college drop out and Tomer Weingarten didn’t attend college after high school. Please note that Elon Musk was not in the original list by AFL-CIO, probably because Musk doesn't have a traditional salary and his salary is often tied with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s financial performance. However, we have added Musk to the list, given his consistently high compensation packages which have also sparked debates recently.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

2024-03-26 11:14:00+00:00,"These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Dominate This $1.7 Trillion Annual Outlay","Companies paid their shareholders a staggering $1.7 trillion in dividends last year. That was up 5% from the prior year, setting a new record. The leading dividend payers might come as a surprise. Tech titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) led the way in dividend payments last year. They're part of the much-lauded ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which are more known for their ability to deliver outsize stock price appreciation than income. Here's a look at their dividend outlays last year and where some of their Magnificent Seven rivals stand as dividend stocks.Microsoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, leading the globe in that category. That massive outlay enabled the technology giant to reclaim the top spot among dividend payers, a title it last held in 2020. Microsoft was second in 2021 and held third place in 2022 after falling behind Australian mining giant BHP Group, which led the way in those two years. BHP Group fell to sixth last year due to the variable nature of its dividend, which ties the payout to its commodity price-driven profits. Meanwhile, Microsoft has increased its dividend per share by 10% in each of the past two years. The tech titan can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the past six months, it has generated $49.4 billion in net cash from operations. It paid $10.6 billion in dividends and repurchased another $8.8 billion of its shares. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion of cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74.2 billion of total debt. Microsoft's strong balance sheet and enormous and growing cash flows have enabled it to steadily increase its dividend. With ample growth catalysts, including massive investments in video games and AI, with its purchase of Activision and its investment in OpenAI, Microsoft should be able to continue paying more money in dividends in the coming years.Apple came in second to Microsoft in dividend payments last year at $14.9 billion, putting it right behind oil giant ExxonMobil. The company increased its dividend per share by 4% last year, its 11th straight year of increasing the payout. Like Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. It produced $39.9 billion in cash from operating activities in its fiscal first quarter of 2024. That easily covered its $3.8 billion dividend outlay in the period. Apple also repurchased a massive $20.1 billion in stock during that quarter. Meanwhile, like Microsoft, Apple has a cash-rich balance sheet. It ended 2023 with $172.6 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $108 billion of debt. Given its monster cash flows and financial strength, Apple could easily overtake Microsoft as the top dividend payer in the future. Of the companies in the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the only other member to pay dividends last year. The semiconductor giant paid $395 million in dividends, which is paltry compared to Apple and Microsoft. It plans to maintain that level in its current fiscal year. However, it's not due to a lack of free cash flow. The company is cashing in on the AI boom. Its free cash flow skyrocketed in fiscal 2024 to an eye-popping $26.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023. It's using that money to buy back stock. It repurchased $9.5 billion in fiscal 2024 and aims to tap the remaining $22.5 billion of its existing authorization by the end of its current fiscal year. The group will have at least one more dividend payer this year. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) initiated a dividend earlier this year. The social media giant will pay about $5 billion in dividends this year at its initial rate. It can easily afford that outlay. It's about 12% of its annual free cash flow, and a similar percentage of the cash currently sitting on its balance sheet. Other Magnificent Seven members could join Meta Platforms as meaningful dividend payers in the future. Search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) certainly has the financial resources to pay dividends. It produced over $100 billion in net cash from operating activities in its last fiscal year, roughly 60% of which it returned to shareholders through repurchases. Like its rivals, Alphabet could pay a dividend while repurchasing a meaningful amount of shares each year. Technology giants generate massive amounts of free cash flow. Microsoft and Apple are using a big chunk of that money to pay dividends, enabling them to lead the world in that category last year. Many of their Magnificent Seven peers also produce prodigious amounts of cash that they could pay out in dividends in the future. That could enable investors in the sector to collect even more income to go along with the stock price appreciation potential these top growth stocks offer.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-26 11:00:00+00:00,"1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club","The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) last year caught many market watchers by surprise, particularly with how quickly it changed the paradigm among some of the world's most valuable companies. Apple ceded the top spot to Microsoft, which now rules the roost with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Nvidia moved quickly up the charts to assume the No. 3 spot behind Apple with a market cap of $2.3 trillion, spurred on by its gold-standard AI chips. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with their own AI solutions -- are also members of this prestigious fraternity.With Palantir Technologies' (NYSE: PLTR) market cap of just $54 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like a longshot to suggest that it is vying for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI and the company's expertise in the field suggest the odds are likely in Palantir's favor.It wasn't very long ago that Palantir was relatively unknown outside of government agency circles. The data mining and AI specialist worked closely with the intelligence community in the U.S. to ferret out terrorists and prevent attacks before they happened. Palantir soon expanded beyond its original mandate, creating sophisticated built-to-order AI models for other government agencies and enterprises, helping discover valuable insights hidden deep within their data.Palantir sprung into action when the market for generative AI exploded early last year, putting decades of expertise to work and developing a solution that could be broadly applied. The fruit of those labors is the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), the company's home-grown generative AI system, which Palantir developed in a matter of months. However, it's the company's go-to-market strategy that is spurring the greatest demand.To capitalize on the opportunity, Palantir is holding boot camps. ""These immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations,"" management wrote in the company's fourth-quarter business update. Attendance at these sessions has been off the charts, as businesses have the opportunity to increase productivity or solve their most pressing business problems using generative AI solutions.In October, Palantir laid out plans to hold 500 boot camps over the coming year. The company has since ""blown that goal out of the water,"" completing over 560 boot camps for 465 organizations in just four months.That strong and growing demand is driving robust financial results. In the fourth quarter, Palantir's revenue of $608 million climbed 20% year over year and 9% sequentially. The biggest contributor was U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 70%, driven by demand for AIP. Palantir delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability, making it eligible to join the S&P 500 index, which some market watchers believe that will happen this year.It was management's outlook that really turned heads, as the company is forecasting at least 40% growth for the U.S. commercial segment -- which includes AIP -- over the coming year.Palantir is in a unique position among AI providers. The company has a long history of AI expertise and a solid track record of fulfilling government contracts. That gives Palantir an edge in providing AI solutions to the U.S. government and its allies, and many believe the quest for sovereign AI among nations has already begun. Add to that the vast potential within enterprise businesses and the opportunity becomes clear -- but it won't happen overnight.According to Wall Street, Palantir is poised to generate revenue of $2.71 billion in 2024 and $3.23 billion by 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 16. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to grow its revenue to roughly $60 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Revenue grew by 20% year over year in the most recent quarter. At that rate, it would take 16 years for Palantir to reach the $1 trillion threshold.However, its U.S. commercial business -- fueled by generative AI -- grew by 70% in Q4, and management is guiding for at least 40% growth for the segment, so it could soon eclipse its other sales. Palantir has a tendency to under promise and over-deliver, so that estimate could well be conservative. If the company grew its revenue closer to 40%, it could be worth $1 trillion or more within a decade.Estimates regarding generative AI are growing by leaps and bounds, but it's estimated the market will be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.If Palantir captures just a small part of that large and growing opportunity, it won't be long before it has secured membership in the $1 trillion club.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-26 10:30:29+00:00,3 ways Apple’s monopoly lawsuit could change the iPhone experience for fans,"When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face “hello” greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design – Apple’s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape.That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world.But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services.The company denied the lawsuit’s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple’s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here’s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users:If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things.One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to “super apps” that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple’s preeminence in the lives of its customers.“An offering like WeChat, dubbed China’s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,” he said. “What Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.”At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn’t been welcomed much in the US anyway.The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple’s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said.Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it’s already working on.The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple’s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same.Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple’s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem.Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives.“The net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple’s customers,” he said.The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple’s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware.The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple’s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience.David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple’s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless.“If Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,” McQueen said.Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem’s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won’t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere.“The vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,” Chatterjee said.But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by “plugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/3-ways-apple-monopoly-lawsuit-103029052.html
2024-03-26 09:47:00+00:00,Want to Get Richer? 2 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"The stock market is an excellent vehicle for generating wealth over many years. It isn't the only way to build up a large retirement nest egg, of course, but owning a diversified portfolio of stocks puts you in a great position to benefit from the long-term growth of the global economy.Besides having a long holding period, the other main ingredient necessary to produce great returns is owning the right stocks. You'll do well simply matching the wider market's roughly 15% annual appreciation. But extending that figure by even a percentage point or two can make a huge difference over several decades.With that goal in mind, let's look at a few stocks that seem destined to be a positive force in your retirement portfolio.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) business has been going through a rough patch lately, with sales declining to $383 billion from $394 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Consumers were less excited to purchase iPhone and Mac products in 2023 as demand for tech devices slowed overall following big gains in the prior two years.Apple is still an incredibly strong business. The company's $383 billion of revenue last year compares well to the $366 billion posted two years earlier. Success in its rapidly expanding services segment offset most of the weakness in the iPhone and Mac franchises in 2023, and that should help to stabilize growth going forward. Growth has returned at the start of fiscal 2025, although it will take some time before it speeds back up toward the double digits.Meanwhile, you'll struggle to find a more financially impressive company. Apple regularly generates more than $100 billion in annual operating cash flow. Those resources allow management to spend aggressively on repurchasing the stock, which in turn amplifies per-share earnings growth. Investors should benefit from that virtuous cycle, even through those inevitable periods of sluggish sales trends.Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has created many millionaires over the decades that it worked to build its dominant retailing business. That process might not be over just yet.Sure, the chain already has a massive global sales base, and a high valuation to go along with it. Walmart won't quickly double or triple its current $500 billion market capitalization.But that doesn't mean you can't get great returns from holding this retailer over the next several decades. Sales growth was robust in 2023 and was anchored by rising customer traffic. That success reflects Walmart's ability to deliver value to its core shoppers, who are increasingly looking for deals. Few of its peers can match Walmart's low prices, which flow from its massive economies of scale.Shareholders today have a good chance at capitalizing on Walmart's push to become more than just a brick-and-mortar retailer. E-commerce sales last year crossed $100 billion and jumped more than 20% compared to the prior year. Walmart is getting a lift from its growing digital advertising business as well.These wins are lifting the company's profit margin above the 3% to 4% rate that investors have seen for many years. Even a small uptick here would have a huge impact on Walmart's annual earnings potential -- if the retailer can make it a sustainable one.While they wait for progress on this score, shareholders can collect Walmart's dividend and allow those quarterly payments to automatically reinvest into more shares. That way, you'll amplify your long-term returns and speed up the process of building wealth with your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-26 08:00:00+00:00,"Despite ""Headline Risk,"" This Magnificent Seven Stock Still Has 45% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst.","There's no argument the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were among the market's best performers last year, and that trend has continued into 2024. Unfortunately, one member of this vaunted group has been in the spotlight but not in a good way. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), alleging the company engaged in questionable practices to maintain a monopoly with its iPhone.One analyst believes that while there are challenges ahead for Apple, the ""headline risk"" doesn't change the overall investing thesis.In the wake of the filing, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his outperform (buy) rating and $250 price target on Apple stock. That represents potential upside for investors of 45% compared to Friday's closing price.Ives notes that while Apple will likely be forced into compromises regarding its App Store policies and may pay a ""hefty fine,"" he doesn't view this development as a ""thesis changer"" despite the ""headline risk."" Furthermore, while the case will remain an overhang, it will take years to resolve.Despite the lawsuit, there's still plenty to like about Apple stock. In its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30), revenue of $119.6 billion climbed 2% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) climbed 16% to $2.18, an all-time high. Management cited expanding margins and record-high services revenue for the solid results. Apple also reported an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices, another record for the company.Furthermore, with inflation beginning to abate, pent-up demand for the iPhone could result in a robust upgrade cycle, which would significantly boost sales.Apple is currently selling for 27 times earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500. That discount to the broad market suggests Apple is a buy now while current headlines are weighing down the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-26 07:37:00+00:00,"AI, EVs, and Beyond: The ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock That Could Reshape the Future","As Yoda once said, ""Always in motion is the future.""And you'll usually find a few companies literally reshaping that ever-shifting future in real time. If you can sort out the makers of the long-term future in the early going, their stocks can be great wealth-building investments for you.For example, Apple defined the last decade and a half with product lines like the iPhone, iPad, and AirPods. The company hopes to write the next chapter of human innovation and game-changing design with the Vision Pro augmented reality headset, and I can only imagine what else might be going on in Apple's top-secret development labs.That said, I'm not here to talk about Apple's potentially culture-defining products. Another stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" club is even more important to the next era of technology and consumer culture, and its business plan looks poised for decades of sustained success.That's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), of course. The parent company of Google is my favorite Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now, and it's not a close call.So far, you know Alphabet for its online search and advertising operations. Most of its current hits -- from Gmail and Google Docs to YouTube and Google Maps -- are part and parcel of this business. Google's online tools help consumers and companies in many ways. There are premium versions in some cases, but the monetization largely springs from the world's largest and most effective advertising platform.But that won't always be the case.Unlike some tech titans clinging to past successes, Alphabet thrives on change. While its core advertising business remains a cash cow, Alphabet isn't afraid to shift gears and invest heavily in the technologies shaping tomorrow. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fresh example. From the deep learning algorithms powering Google Search to its Waymo self-driving car initiative, Alphabet recognizes the transformative potential of AI and is pouring heavy resources into its development.And this forward-thinking mindset extends beyond specific technologies.The creation of the Alphabet brand in 2015 was a pivotal move under CFO Ruth Porat's leadership. Separating the core Google business from ""moonshot"" ventures like Waymo and Verily Life Sciences (focused on health research) allowed Alphabet to chase disruptive innovations without being tethered to Google's existing structure. The Alphabet brand provides a broader umbrella, allowing the company to pursue ideas that might not fit neatly within the traditional ""Google"" image.This move signaled Alphabet's willingness to explore seemingly disparate fields -- medical research today, self-driving cars tomorrow, and who knows what groundbreaking venture next?I have only scratched the surface of Alphabet's audacious innovations here. It would take a book to explain them all, and many of tomorrow's best business ideas probably aren't even public knowledge yet.The company is tackling climate change with Project Loon (balloon-powered internet), exploring human longevity in the Calico operation, and reinventing electric power grids with AI analytics under the Tapestry project. These moonshots may seem like science fiction today, but they have the potential to become tomorrow's revolutionary realities.So Alphabet is writing the next generation's history books as we speak, always ready to take another sharp turn as the changing market conditions might require. Come back in a decade or more, and I'm sure Alphabet will remain an innovative business giant with a ton of operations you haven't even heard of yet. Google may be a fading name by then (but probably not yet), and Alphabet will still do just fine with a bunch of different ideas.And the other Magnificent Seven stocks might struggle to do the same.That's the foundation of my investment thesis for Alphabet. Furthermore, the stock happens to look like a great buy right now. Alphabet's stock hasn't soared to the moon in the ongoing AI boom, giving investors more time to pick up shares at a relatively modest price.An equal-weighted portfolio of the Magnificent Seven stocks gained 70% over the last 52 weeks. On average, they're trading at 7.7 times sales and 38 times trailing earnings.Alphabet's stock looks like a bargain in this company. With a milder year-over-year price gain of 46%, Alphabet's stock is worth 6.1 times the company's annual sales and 26 times earnings. It's the most affordable Magnificent Seven stock by many metrics, including its price-to-earnings and price-to-cash ratios.So Alphabet is an epic innovator with its sights set on the far horizon -- and the stock isn't even expensive.

2024-03-26 01:33:54+00:00,Tim Cook’s Love for China Helps Xi Fight Fears of Economic Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to counter the downbeat narrative about a structural slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy got a boost from enthusiastic endorsements from chief executives of top global companies.Most Read from BloombergLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth BillionsBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll ShowsJapan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990China Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest BanksTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest PeopleDays after he opened an expansive new retail store in Shanghai and pledged a fresh investment in applied research in the country, Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook on Sunday gushed, “I love it here, I love the Chinese people.”“It’s so vibrant and so dynamic here,” Cook told journalists as he entered the opening session of the China Development Forum, a top annual gathering of business leaders and Chinese officials. Apple has faced expanding restrictions on iPhone use at government agencies and state-backed companies and sales of the smartphone tumbled 24% in the first six weeks of the year.The CDF confab is one of a series this week that offer China a chance to rekindle overseas interest in the nation after an historic slump in foreign investment.For global executives, the meetings are a chance to underscore interest in participating in the giant Chinese market despite deepening geopolitical tensions and moves in China to favor local competitors. Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla called China “an extremely attractive place.” Nestle SA’s Mark Schneider lauded plans to boost Chinese consumption.Premier Li Qiang delivered an address in the Sunday session, assuring attendees at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse that China’s economic recovery has been improving, while recognizing some challenges. Later this week, Beijing hosts the Invest in China summit, followed by the annual Boao Forum for Asia on the southern resort island of Hainan.Read More: China’s Premier Says Nation Off to Good Start on 2024 GoalsThe glowing remarks by foreign CEOs featured in posts on social media by Hua Chunying, an assistant foreign minister, to her 2.4 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter.The China Development Forum, which ended Monday, attracted 81 global CEOs to attend in person, largely rebounding to pre-pandemic levels. Li’s speech marked an upgrade of sorts — it’s usually a vice premier who delivers the keynote address — marking a contrast to the premier’s cancellation of a high-profile annual press conference involving the international press earlier this month. A report that Li wouldn’t attend a closed-door meeting with the foreign CEOs also spurred questions about his influence.Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies who attended the opening session, offered a mixed review.Li’s address was “reassuring about demonstrating the Chinese government knows how serious domestic problems they face are — and the difficult geopolitical environment,” Kennedy said. But “there was still insufficient specifics and details around what changes to domestic policy they’ll make, and really no recognition that Chinese policies are generating global anxieties and increasing geostrategic tensions,” he said.President Xi Jinping may offer his own remarks to executives later this week, with a potential sit-down on Wednesday. Meantime, Vice President Han Zheng is scheduled to speak at the Invest In China summit Tuesday.For now, overseas business representatives were happy to endorse the messages received.Read More: China’s Inbound Investment Slows Again Despite Beijing’s EffortsNestle’s Schneider said Li’s remarks on access for international companies and on bringing back domestic consumption were “music to our ears.” Bourla of Pfizer praised China for having a “coherent, cohesive plan.”The People’s Daily newspaper, an official mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, touted the recent flurry of visits by foreign executives in a page-3 commentary on Monday that proclaimed the country as an indispensable market.While International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva called at the forum Sunday for more pro-market reforms, the People’s Daily characterized them as a nod to China’s “new-era of high-quality growth.”The IMF chief was joined at the forum by World Bank President Ajay Banga, helping add to an appearance of re-engagement between Washington and Beijing months after the US-China presidential summit in San Francisco. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last year said the IMF and World Bank “reflect American values.” Yellen herself is expected to return for a visit to Beijing soon.It marked a notable shift from last year, when a number of overseas corporate leaders were hesitant to attend the forum amid an escalation in US-China tensions.“It was very important to have the premier here and speaking to business directly,” said Sean Stein, chair of the American Chamber of Commerce China. “The China Development Forum was always seen as the premier’s platform to talk with businesses on what’s happening in the economy, and that exchange goes all the way back to Zhu Rongji days,” he said, referring to a pro-reform former premier.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon ValleyTesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tim-cook-love-china-helps-013354984.html
2024-03-26 00:03:00+00:00,Apple stock slips after CEO Tim Cook pitches China,"Apple  (AAPL)  shares closed lower Monday, extending a notable 2024 decline for the world's second-largest company as it balances the challenges of aggressive regulations in Europe and the U.S. and a realigning of its broader position in Asian markets.CEO Tim Cook wraps up a five-day visit to China, as part of the tech giant's renewed Asia push, early this week to revive growth in the world's biggest smartphone market — which also happens to host the most critical elements of its global supply chain.Last week, Cook opened the company's newest flagship Apple Store in Shanghai, the second-largest behind its Fifth Avenue location in New York and met with key suppliers and government officials including Commerce Minister Wang Wentao ahead of a key business development summit that ended Monday.China remains one of the most important markets for Apple, accounting for around 20% of its global sales, pegged last year at around $386 billion, although that share has fallen steadily since 2015 and has largely plateaued since the COVID pandemic of 2020.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesIncreased competition from lower-priced rivals and a drive by Beijing to bolster the fortunes of state-backed Huawei Technologies have added to Apple's China-sale challenge, as have the ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and Washington's move to limit the export of high-end technologies.Reports have suggested that Beijing has banned the use of iPhones by government employees and state-backed enterprises to support the launch of Huawei's new Mate 60 handset.Apple's fourth quarter 2023 China sales fell nearly 13% from a year earlier, the company reported in February, even as global iPhone revenue surprised to the upside at just under $70 billion.The decline prompted a rare move from Apple to cut the price of its new iPhone 15 by around $70, or 5%, as part of a Lunar New Year promotion in late January.Cook said Apple would launch its new Vision Pro headset in China later this year, telling CCTV that he remains ""very confident"" regarding domestic market prospects.“I love China, I love being here, I love the people and the culture,"" Cook said on a broadcast streamed through CCTV's Weibo social media account. ""Every time I come here, I am reminded that anything is possible here.”However, Cook needs to balance the need for a robust sales base in China and the support of officials in Beijing with its broader Asia efforts as it gingerly retools its supply chain to locations in Vietnam, Thailand, and India. The goal is to reduce its reliance on a single location — and to ease the political risk tied to tensions between Beijing and Taiwan.Related: Goldman Sachs analysts unveil a big change to Apple's outlook""There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,"" Cook reportedly told the state-controlled China Daily over the weekend, but the group's recent push into India suggests it's playing a much longer game.""The timing of this trip was important as, in essence, Apple needs China and China needs Apple despite all the noise,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. ""Apple needs to turn this headwind into a tailwind heading into the iPhone 16 release this fall and it all starts with reaffirming Apple's presence"" in the world's second-largest economy.At the same time, however, Cook is shrewdly making inroads into India, an economy boasting more than a billion citizens and a huge, largely untapped, iPhone market.Apple doesn't break out India sales separately, but Cook said revenue hit a record last quarter, and data from CounterPoint Research suggests it topped more than 10 million iPhone shipments in the Android-dominated market last year.Its overall market share, however, is only around 6.5%, well south of the 20% stake it commands in China, according to International Data Corp. figures. That provides a huge opportunity for sales growth over the coming years.India Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wants to see that nation become a major export hub for smartphones, and he has courted Apple and others in setting up new manufacturing bases, including an iPhone 15 assembly facility, run by Taiwan-based Foxconn, in Tamil Nadu.That may be why his government reversed an earlier rule earlier this month, following intense lobbying from the U.S., to require laptop makers to obtain licenses for all shipments into the estimated $8 billion a year market.Apple's Asia fortunes could be even more critical over the coming years as it grapples with a slowdown in U.S. demand, which some have tied to its lack of new product innovation, and an intensifying regulatory environment in key Western markets.EU regulators, which have long held U.S. tech giants in their crosshairs, opened an antitrust probe into Apple this week under the region's newly enforced Digital Markets Act.Related: Apple hit by massive music streaming fine (it's big)Last week in the U.S., Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled details of an antitrust suit that accused the tech giant of running a monopoly in the smartphone market that if left unchallenged ""will only continue to strengthen.""""We do see an increasing likelihood that AAPL will be forced to incrementally open up its ecosystem over time across all geographies but view monopolistic claims as a bit of a reach,"" said CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.""All eyes will be on whether recent changes in Europe and the pending U.S. litigation will impact the growth trajectory of Apple's high-margin services business.""The weakening sales, tepid innovation and long-armed regulators have combined to shave more than $300 billion from Apple's market value this year, with the shares falling more than 8% and trailing only Tesla TSLA as the worst-performing Magnificent 7 stock. More Tech Stocks:Google fined $270 million by French regulatory authorityAnalysts revamp Nvidia price targets as Blackwell tightens AI market gripAnalysts overhaul Micron stock price target ahead of earningsIves at Wedbush, however, sees the recent events as strengthening the case for Apple's renewed Asia push, noting that China's recent foreign investment slump and moribund domestic economy make the two necessary if wary, bedfellows.""Cupertino is facing regulatory battles from all directions,"" Ives said. ""And while China has been a headache for Apple over the past year, it appears to be changing its tune as the threat of Apple taking its supply chain outside China has been heard loud and clear from Beijing.""""We have seen Apple's back against the wall before and we view this period as just another chapter in the Apple growth story with AI now on the doorstep,"" he added.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-woos-000300010.html
2024-03-25 21:06:36+00:00,"Apple faces 'headline risk' from regulators, not fundamental risk","Apple (AAPL) faces regulatory pressures after reports of several investigations, from an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to the European Union's (EU) probe into Big Tech players.Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of.Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJOSH LIPTON: All right, moving on. Here, let's go to the Apple stock-- down nearly 11% so far this year as the tech giant faces several headwinds. The European Union dealing the latest blow as it launches a probe into Apple, Meta, and Alphabet under the new Digital Markets Act. Tech legislation Evercore ISI senior managing director Amit Daryanani here now with more on the uphill battle for Apple.Ahmed, it is great to see you on the show. Let's just start right there. Apple now in the crosshairs of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. We'll start with this news from the EU. They're launching this probe, Amit, into big tech including Apple. How worried should Apple investors be about that, Amit? What are you telling your clients?AMIT DARYANANI: Yeah. Josh, we think both sides of the discussion, be that in the US and Europe, at this point seems to have more noise around it and headline risk versus fundamental risk. Even if you enable things like side loading, for example, which is what the EU is trying to get to, we don't think it has a material impact to Apple at the end of the day.If you look at the entirety of EU, Apple does about 1.2 billion of services revenues-- of App Store revenues I should say, from the EU. So, even under one of scenarios that goes to 0, it really does not make a big dent to Apple. Let's say the EU App Store business is de minimis for it to have a real impact.We'll have to see, I think, elements in the US, how they play out will be more material, especially how the Google, Apple relationship is going to get worked out, and what the DOJ comes out on that. I think that's financially is going to be a much more relevant headline announcement than anything else, but a lot of the other stuff we think is more headline risk, more noise versus a fundamental impact to Apple's model.AKIKO FUJITA: So, let's hone in a bit more on what's been playing out on the US side. I mean, you talked about that partnership with Google. There's obviously concerns about the search side of things. But also as Apple looks to build out their AI capabilities-- that partnership that was reported with Gemini. I mean, how do you think this all plays out when they are under the microscope of the DOJ right now, and what does that ultimately mean on the other side?AMIT DARYANANI: Yeah, listen, I think all these companies have been under the microscope for an awfully long time, so I think they're going to do what they have to do to ensure the business continues to thrive. You know, I'll take two parts of it, right, listen. Google pays Apple $16 to $20 billion is a range out there for being the default search engine. About 40% of that business is obviously in the US, so the risk if this thing gets completely struck down is someone like Apple could lose 40% of that $16 billion number.Let's just say it's about $6 billion of revenues, which is high profit margin, could go away, right. Now, there are offsets to that, I would argue. Apple will still get some sort of attack from Google. Maybe it's not all the $6 billion, but there will be some sort of comeback out of it, right. But headline, that's a risk you have-- the Google, Apple default search option goes away.JOSH LIPTON: And let me ask you, this stock is under pressure obviously-- it was down about 10% so far this year. In part, I think investors are concerned about Tim Cook's AI strategy. What is that strategy, Amit? I mean, do you think we're going to get some big news out of Apple's big software show in June?AMIT DARYANANI: Listen, our expectation is yes, you'll get some good news around the AI stuff at WWDC. Now, the stock has underperformed, I think, very, very simplistically for the fact that for every dollar that's going into NVIDIA, it's implicitly coming from Apple. It's not quite that easy, but I think, really, it's more positioning and Apple not being an AI story, right.What we think Apple is going to talk about is almost a 2-step AI narrative, right. What they'll say is, listen, for very GPU intensive things like video editing, image creation, you should use something like Google Gemini, essentially, right. So, they'll have that partnership with Google to do that. For a lot of the simpler text based text based AI uses, if you may, I think what they'll do at WWDC is unlock local inferencing.And what that effectively would mean is you could actually run smaller LLMs, three to six million parameter LLMs on your iPhone. It's going to be faster, it's going to be cheaper, it's going to be more secure for you to do that. So, we think there's a huge value prop there. And I think that's what Apple is going to talk about. Smaller LLMs on your iPhone, which by the way, could-- we believe will trigger an iPhone supercycle. And for the more complicated stuff, they'll probably offload it to someone like Google Gemini and have a partnership with them.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-faces-headline-risk-regulators-210636899.html
2024-03-25 21:00:10+00:00,Steve Jobs Didn't Become A Billionaire Because Of Apple – It Was Actually Pixar And The Toy Story Movie,"Steve Jobs is a name synonymous with Apple, the tech giant he co-founded. However, a lesser-known chapter significantly shaped his career and wealth: Pixar Animation Studios. It was Pixar's IPO and the massive success of the movie ""Toy Story"" that made Jobs his first billion, according to reports.After being ousted from Apple in 1985 because of disagreements with the board of directors, Jobs found himself at a crossroads. This pivotal moment in his life led him to Pixar.Don't Miss:Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.In the mid-1990s, while contemplating a return to Apple, Jobs confided in Lawrence Levy, a Pixar colleague, expressing doubts about Apple’s future and his potential role in its revival. During this period, Jobs was at the helm of Pixar, having acquired the computer graphics division from Lucasfilm in 1986, and transformed it into an independent studio. Under his leadership as CEO and major shareholder, Pixar revolutionized animation and secured Jobs’s financial legacy.The turning point came with Pixar’s initial public offering (IPO) in November 1995, coinciding with the release of “Toy Story,” the studio’s first feature film. The IPO was a resounding success, catapulting Jobs into the ranks of billionaires. According to Cult Of Mac, he called his friend Google co-founder Larry Page and said ""I made it.""Trending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.It was a defining moment that underscored his ability to lead and innovate beyond the realm of personal computing into the entertainment industry. Lawrence Levy’s memoir, “To Pixar and Beyond,” chronicles this journey and the strategic decisions that propelled Pixar into a leading animation studio and, eventually, its acquisition by Disney in 2006 for over $7 billion.The success at Pixar restored Jobs’s reputation and gave him the confidence to reassume leadership at Apple. His experiences at Pixar, navigating the intricacies of the entertainment industry alongside Levy, provided lessons that Jobs would later apply to Apple’s operations. The synergy between technology and storytelling that defined Pixar’s ethos became a fundamental aspect of Apple’s product development under Jobs’s leadership.Jobs’s venture into animation showcases his multifaceted career, marked by innovation, resilience and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His legacy at Pixar is a testament to his vision of blending technology and art for compelling narratives, a philosophy he carried over to Apple. Through Pixar, Jobs not only redefined animation but set a new standard for leadership and creativity in business, leaving a permanent mark on Silicon Valley and Hollywood.Read Next: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.On a hunt for a future startup unicorn?

2024-03-25 20:48:12+00:00,Investing in Innovation: 10 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs,"In this article, we discuss 10 best tech and disruptive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the tech landscape, head over to Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs. High inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, resulting in softer consumer spending, reduced product demand, market capitalization declines, and workforce reductions made headlines in 2022. These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloitte suggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers.Ken Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented: “In 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.”Similarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad: “Notwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today’s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.”In 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forrester forecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets. Forrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth.Cathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans.According to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood. Coinbase is Wood's largest portfolio holding as of Q4 2023.Some of the top tech stocks to buy include Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.Or how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Netflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.With regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 139.09%Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) is an actively managed fund aiming for capital appreciation through investments in companies advancing automation and task enhancement technologies.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”   Click to continue reading and see Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.  Suggested articles:15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US20 Biggest Energy Companies in Australia for 2024Billionaire Steve Cohen and Insiders Are Buying These 10 Stocks Disclosure: None.

The rules require six designated ""gatekeepers"" that provide services like search engines, social media networks and chat apps to comply with a guidance to level the playing field with their rivals and to give users more choices. Violations of the law could result in fines amounting up to as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover.The European Commission's investigation focuses on Google parent Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari users, as well as Meta's ""pay or consent model.""The Commission said it ""suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.""

2024-03-25 19:00:04+00:00,Pensions Secretary defends DWP in Waspi row,"The work and pensions secretary has defended his department as he refused to commit to compensating women hit by the state pension age change.In its report last week, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) said that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had failed to adequately communicate changes to the women’s state pension age and those affected were due compensation.The ombudsman recommended a payout of up to £2,950 to the thousands of women affected whom it said had been the victim of government “injustice”. Waspi women claim to have been left tens of thousands of pounds worse off from the change.However, speaking in the Commons on Monday, Mel Stride said that the scope of the report covered “a narrow period” between 2005 and 2007, and that the ombudsman had found that the DWP had met “expected standards” of communication between 1995 and 2004.He added that information communicating the change had been available in leaflets. The Government, he said, would now consider the report’s findings “fully and properly”.He said: “Had the Government not equalised the state pension age women would have been retiring today at 60 and they could have spent on average over 40pc of their adult lives in receipt of state pension. This would have been unfair.”Mr Stride also highlighted that the ombudsman had not found “that women have directly lost out financially as a result of DWP’s actions.”From 1948 until 2010, the state pension age was 60 for women and 65 for men – but a law change in 1995 ruled the women’s pension age would increase to 65 between 2010 and 2020.The campaign Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) says as many as 3.8 million women born in the 1950s were not made aware of the age change – and were forced to delay retirement without adequate warning.An open letter urging a vote by MPs on compensation for women affected by state pension changes has been sent to House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt.The letter, signed by more than 30,000 people according to the Waspi campaign, said “the Commons must urgently have the opportunity to debate and vote” on compensation proposals.But Mr Stride refused to commit to compensation payments, which the ombudsman estimates would cost the Treasury between £3.5bn and £10.5bn.It comes after David Gauke, a former work and pension secretary, said Waspi women should be denied compensation in part because they were responsible for staying up-to-date with the state pension age rise.He said: “Yes, perhaps DWP should have done more. But there is also some responsibility on individuals to acquaint themselves with the relevant facts and plan their own finances accordingly.“The increase was not a secret. We cannot sustainably have a situation where the cost of people failing to check their assumptions over a period of decades is socialised.”Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister, said the announcement represented a “frustrating but predictable” delay for the Waspi cause, but that it laid the groundwork for a Commons vote on the issue.He added: “On the one hand it’s a complicated 100-page report – on the other the government knew exactly what it was going to say, they’ve had plenty of time.“The only calculation is ‘what’s the cheapest solution we can get through on a Commons vote?’. The Treasury will have said to Mel Stride - spend as little as you can.”Angela Madden, chair of the Waspi campaign, said: “The Secretary of State now says this matter is so complex, he needs yet more months and years of head scratching to sort it out. He has made much of the report being 100 pages long as if he were being asked to digest War and Peace.“The fact it has taken five years for the ombudsman to produce his conclusions is a pretty perverse reason to say more delay is now justified.“The report is not complicated at all. It says that 1950s-born women should be compensated and that Parliament should intervene to make a scheme happen.“Every day 111 of the affected women die waiting for justice. The Commons must get a debate and vote on compensation as soon as possible after Easter.”Chris Price will be back with the latest first thing tomorrow morning.The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions sparked angry reactions on social media when he this evening said the Government was still considering the recommendation to compensate Waspi women.While speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Stride promised there would be “no undue delay” in responding to the report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.Discussion in Parliament about #waspiwomen . All sides saying the same thing but Mel Stride giving no answers. Once again Gov delaying and not getting on with the job.— lucy (@lucypcat) March 25, 2024An hour's waffle in Parliament just for DWP to say it will be sorted out ASAP. And refuse to accept failings. Same old story. Wait and wait . But I think Mel Stride clearly got the message it's not going away.— E Nuff (Mrs) (@enuffisenuff19) March 25, 2024Spiky exchanges in the House today as Mel Stride questioned over potential for compensation for WASPI women. Lost count of how many times he's said there will be no undue delay in govt response.— Helen Morrissey (@Pension_Helen) March 25, 2024Inflation will fall below the Bank of England’s 2pc target and remain too low for the next three years, according to economists at Capital Economics.Consumer prices will grow at a far slower pace than in the US and the eurozone, they added.Analysts at the consultancy predicted inflation will fall from 3.4pc in February below 2pc in April, before plunging further to 0.5pc later this year.In a note to clients, they said:That’s why we think the Bank of England will cut interest rates from 5.25pc to 3pc by next year rather than to 3.75pc as investors expect. What’s more, a further rebound in the economy’s supply capacity means this can all happen while GDP growth is stronger than widely expected.The world’s largest central bank must take a ‘cautious’ approach to cutting interest rates to allow for more time to bring inflation down in some parts of the economy, a rate-setter at the Federal Reserve has warned.Fed Governor Lisa Cook said that even as the US economy had moved into “better balance” to achieve the central bank’s goals, “fully restoring price stability may take a cautious approach to easing monetary policy over time.”It comes after the Fed’s panel of rate-setters voted to hold interest rates at a target range of 5.25pc to 5.50pc last week.The US economy has held up surprisingly well in the face of high borrowing costs, with intense market speculation over when the first cut will come.That’s all from me today. My colleague Eir Nolsøe will keep you informed for the rest of the day.With many of you preparing for an Easter getaway (or dreaming of one) I’ll leave you with this shot from Mai Khao Beach in Phuket, Thailand.The upcoming season of “The White Lotus” is expected to have a massive impact on tourism at popular destinations in the country like Koh Samui, Phuket, and Bangkok.US new home sales ticked down surprisingly in February, according to government data, after January’s rate was revised higher.New single-family home sales were at an annual rate of 662,000 last month, which was 0.3pc down from the revised 664,000 figure for January, the Commerce Department said.The average sales price of new properties sold was $400,500 (£316,749), lower than the month prior as well.The slight decrease comes as mortgage rates remain at a much higher level than in recent years.But the situation has also made homeowners reluctant to enter the market to sell their real estate, having locked in lower rates previously, which leads to supply shortages.US single-family home sales unexpectedly eased 0.3% to a 662,000 unit pace in February. A modest gain was expected. February gains were centered in the South and West.

back today as investors await fresh US inflation figures due later this week.Sterling was up 0.4pc against the dollar at $1.2648 after hitting a low of $1.2576 on Friday.The euro was little changed against the pound at 85.71p, down from Friday’s two-month high of 86.02p.The pound dropped about 1pc against the dollar last week after the Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25pc on Thursday and Bailey said inflation is moving in the right direction for interest rate cuts.Traders now see a roughly 75pc chance that the Bank of England will cut interesty rates by June, up from about 35pc at the start of last week, according to money market pricing.However, the pound has strengthened ahead of the US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, on Friday.Novo Nordisk has agreed to buy a German biotech company developing heart disease treatments for €1bn (£856bn) as it expands into cardiovascular treatments.The Danish maker of the

lead its commercial airplanes unit.Ryanair warned in February that Airline ticket prices could rise by as much as 10pc this summer amid a looming shortage of airliners from both Boeing and its European rival Airbus.Mr O’Leary said:We welcome these much-needed management changes in Seattle.We look forward to working with Stephanie Pope to accelerate B737 aircraft deliveries to customers, including Ryanair in Europe, for summer and autumn 2024.We also look forward to continuing to work with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and CFO Brian West, and to helping Boeing recover its aircraft deliveries so that Ryanair can continue to grow strongly as Boeing’s no.1 customer here in Europe.Virgin Wines said it is “confident” of meeting targets for the year after its sales grew despite pressure on consumer spending.Shares improved 13pc today as Jay Wright, chief executive of the retail business, hailed the “positive first-half performance”, which he said included strength over the key Christmas period.The company told shareholders that revenues grew by 2pc to £34.3m for the half-year to December 29, compared with the same period a year earlier.Virgin Wines said it benefited from resilient demand and new strategic initiatives, as it seeks to bounce back from a loss in the previous financial year due to cost inflation and teething problems in its new warehouse systems.The group said earnings for the latest half-year rose by 122pc to £1.8m and have put it on track to meet profit guidance for the year.Boeing has announced that its chief executive Dave Calhoun will leave his post as the aviation giant faces increased scrutiny after a series of safety incidents and manufacturing issues.Mr Calhoun said in a letter to staff that “the eyes of the world are on us, and I know that we will come through this moment a better company,” putting “safety and quality at the forefront of everything that we do.”Chairman Larry Kellner has also told the company he does not plan to stand for re-election, while Stan Deal, the president and chief executive of its commercial airplanes unit, will retire from the company. Stephanie Pope will now lead the division.The Federal Aviation Administration has put Boeing under intense scrutiny and recently ordered an audit of assembly lines at a Boeing factory near Seattle, where the company builds planes like the Alaska Airlines 737 Max that suffered a door-panel blowout on January 5.Investigators say bolts that help keep the panel in place were missing after repair work at the Boeing factory. The incident has raised scrutiny of Boeing to its highest level since two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.Shares rose more than 2pc before the market open.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the latest.Ericsson has announced it will cut 1,200 jobs as it strives to reduce costs.The telecoms company said the losses would happen in Sweden, where it is headquartered, adding that the business will also reduce its use of consultants.Bosses said they have entered negotiations with unions.US stock indexes have fallen in premarket trading ahead of key inflation figures at the end of the week.Both the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow logged their best weekly percentage gains so far this year on Friday, with the Fed sticking to its guidance of three interest rate cuts this year.HSBC became the latest brokerage to lift its year-end target for the benchmark S&P 500, raising it to 5,400 from the 5,000 it had forecast previously.Traders now see a 75pc chance of the Fed bringing in the first cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool, up from around 55pc.However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said late on Friday he now expects just a single quarter-point cut instead of the two he had projected, citing persistent inflation and stronger-than-anticipated economic data.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had fallen 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 has dropped 0.6pc.Cocoa has surpassed $9,000 a ton for the first time as a poor harvest has left chocolate makers grappling to secure supplies of the crop.Prices have risen 50pc in this month alone and have more than doubled this year after bad weather and crop disease hit growers in West Africa where most of it is grown.Cocoa is even more expensive than industrial metal copper, which is considered a bellwether for commodities.Chocolate prices are expected to rise throughout the year, with Easter eggs already more expensive as a result of last year’s price jump.Cocoa was last up 2.8pc to $9,188.Google said that it has made “significant changes” to the way its services operate in Europe to comply with new legislation from the EU.Google’s competition director Oliver Bethell said:We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe.We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.The FTSE 100 will power to a new record high over the next year, a Wall Street bank has predicted, as falling interest rates give investors a boost.Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the UK’s blue chip stock index over the next 12 months from 7,900 to 8,200, which would smash its previous record of 8,014.31 set in February last year.The investment bank’s fresh predictions come as the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve both indicated last week that summer interest rate cuts are a real possibility.Lilia Peytavin, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs, said: “As central banks embark on a rate cutting cycle, valuations tend to rise.”She added that European stocks “trade at a historical discount to US equities,” making them potentially more attractive.The FTSE 100 climbed 1.6pc on Thursday and Friday to close at 7,930.92 after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said rate cuts are “on the way”. It was last down 0.4pc today to 7,897.56.The Abu Dhabi fund bidding for The Telegraph has been granted more time to make concessions to the Government amid concerns about the impact of the deal on press freedom.Our reporter James Warrington has the details:Redbird IMI now has until 9am on Tuesday 2 April to offer a solution to concerns that its ownership of the newspaper would harm the public interest, extended from an initial deadline of 9am today.Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer last week said she was “minded to” refer the planned takeover of the Telegraph by RedBird IMI to an in-depth investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).She gave the fund, which is majority backed by UAE vice-president Sheikh Mansour, 10 working days to respond to the plans, with the original deadline set for this morning.Read why she agreed to extend the deadline.The Government’s stake in NatWest has fallen below 30pc for the first time since the rescue of the bank during the global financial crisis.The taxpayer now owns 29.82pc of the bank, meaning the Treasury is technically no longer a “controlling shareholder” in the lender, although it has no material impact on the relationship between the two.The Government’s ownership of NatWest was 37.98pc at the end of last year.A NatWest spokesman said:We welcome the government’s continued commitment to returning NatWest Group to private ownership.With the government shareholding now below 30pc, we have been pleased with the recent momentum to achieving this shared ambition, which we believe is in the best interests of the bank and our shareholders.Apple, Meta and Google face the risk of fines worth billions of euros as the European Union launched its first major investigations into compliance of new Big Tech laws.Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton, the EU’s competition and digital markets chiefs, announced five investigations into the three companies today.They concern areas including the companies’ smartphone app stores and Meta charging a monthly fee to users in Europe who do not want to see adverts on Facebook and Instagram.It comes less than three weeks after the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force. The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers - Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft - which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.In Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn). It comes just weeks after it was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.The investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.The European Commission said the fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.Mr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”Energy regulator Ofgem has launched a consultation on a range of options for the future of the price cap, including a “more dynamic cap” with “time-of-use dependent unit rates to encourage consumer flexibility”.It is also introducing a targeted cap which could be based on a variety of factors such as vulnerability, and more flexible, market-based price protections such as setting a limit between a supplier’s default tariff and tariffs available in the market, capping the margin suppliers are able to make, or replacing the cap with a ban on acquisition-only tariffs.Ofgem said the price cap, along with the temporary ban on acquisition-only tariffs, had worked well to protect customers from the “loyalty penalty” where customers on default tariffs paid higher prices, and from the worst of the recent volatile markets and wholesale price surges as a result of the energy crisis.But it said energy retail markets were changing as increasing numbers of consumers changed their energy consumption and began using electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels.Oil prices have risen following the terrorist attack in Russia and drone strikes on refineries in the country.Brent crude rose towards $86 a barrel after losing more than 2pc in the final three days of last week, while West Texas Intermediate rose 0.6pc to more than $81.A terrorist attack in Moscow over the weekend left more than 130 people dead.The assault was claimed by Islamic State, although President Vladimir Putin hinted at Ukrainian involvement.In addition, continued drone strikes by Ukraine are also crimping Russia’s crude-refining capabilities.Oil is headed for a third monthly gain as the Opec+ cartel presses on with reductions in output and the US tightens sanctions on Russian crude.The boss of Legoland operator Merlin has warned higher taxes are making it harder to make big investments in Britain.Scott O’Neil said “tourist dollars seem to be moving elsewhere” as the Government refuses to reinstate VAT-free shopping for foreign visitors after axing the policy in 2021.He was speaking after the company launched a new rollercoaster at Alton Towers and is poised to launch a Woodland Village attraction at Legoland in Windsor in the spring.He told Bloomberg: “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to place those bets in the UK.”He added: “We want to make sure this is the greatest place in the world to invest our pounds. We want to be here. But some things have to move for that to happen.”The company, which was taken private by Blackstone in 2019, revealed revenues rose 8pc to a record £2.1bn last year after it welcomed 62.1m visitors.Merlin has more than 7,500 staff in the UK and has more than 30 attractions including the London Eye and Chessington World of Adventures.Shares in Direct Line plummeted as markets opened for the first time after potential suitor Ageas said it would not bid to buy the company.The insurance company was trading down as much as 15.8pc as investors reacted to the news, which was released on Friday evening.Ageas, a Belgian insurer which is headquartered in Brussels, said that after being unable to “engage with” Direct Line’s board despite two attempts, it “will not make an offer” to buy the business.Shares in Direct Line soared last month as it revealed it had rejected a takeover approach from its Belgian rival.Ageas said it had sent an initial proposal to Direct Line on January 19, then improved its bid on March 13. It said:Throughout the entire process, Ageas has always sought engagement with Direct Line’s board. Ageas regrets that it has not been able to work collaboratively together with the board of directors of Direct Line towards a recommended firm offer.Ageas was not able to identify additional elements based on publicly-available information that would justify significant adjustments to the terms of its possible offer.Therefore, consistent with its financial discipline, Ageas has decided not to make a firm offer.Gas prices have risen after attacks on underground storage sites in Ukraine raised concerns about supplies.Europe’s benchmark contract rose as much as 4.2pc as it continues on its longest-weekly run of gains in more than a year.Its latest move higher comes as Russia struck an underground gas storage facility in western Ukraine during a missile and drone attack on Sunday.Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said:With both countries attacking energy infrastructure, the supply of gas and fuel is once again being called into question.For gas, not least the latest attempt by Russia to hit an underground storage site in Ukraine has raised the temperature today.Dutch front-month futures were last up 2.6pc to more than €28 per megawatt hour. The UK equivalent was up 2.3pc to more than 73p per therm.The FTSE 100 kicked off the short week flat ahead of more key US inflation data due later in the week.The blue-chip index was little changed after it notched its highest close in a year on Friday as investors cheered signals of impending interest rate cuts from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve.Focus will now shift to the US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, on Friday to further gauge the trajectory of inflation and interest rates.Energy shares gained as much as 0.8pc as crude prices climbed amid concerns over tighter global supply brought about by escalating conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine.Shares of Kingfisher slipped 2.4pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 as the B&Q owner warned that current-year profit would fall short of analysts’ expectations.The mid-cap FTSE 250 was down as much as 0.8pc. Mobico slumped as much as 10pc to a four-month low after the transport company cut its profit guidance and delayed its full-year results.Direct Line plunged as much as 16pc after Belgium rival Ageas said on Friday that it would not make a further takeover offer for the insurer.Sir Keir Starmer will set out Labour’s plans for a publicly owned clean energy company during a visit to North Wales.Jo Stevens, the shadow secretary of state for Wales, said Labour intended to create a “more patriotic economy”.She told GB News:We will set out our plans today for secure homegrown British energy.That will mean we will invest in clean energy generation that will cut bills for businesses and households across the country, create good well-paid jobs for people across the country as well, and at the same time take back control of our energy security so we are not relying on tyrants like Vladimir Putin.Ms Stevens outlined Labour’s plan to double onshore wind power, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind, and confirmed no intention to introduce fracking.She added: “Labour is committed to taking back control of our national energy security and we’re going to do that through Great British Energy - a publicly owned clean energy company.”Energy costs in the UK rose sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Nissan will expand its electric vehicle lineup, develop more powerful batteries and cut production costs as it pushes for higher sales.Chief executive Makoto Uchida said the Japanese car maker would also speed up production in what he called “The Arc” pathway to higher revenues by 2030.He said:The auto industry is now being forced to reshape its values so we can say continuous change is the new normal.Nissan must change. We cannot succeed if we continue along the same path.Costs will come down for electric models so they’ll be about the same as gasoline-engine models by fiscal 2030, while global sales will grow by a million vehicles during that period, he added.Last year, Nissan sold nearly 3.4m vehicles around the world, up about 5pc from the previous year.The company is planning 30 new models over the next three years, 16 of them EVs.Nissan plans to launch 34 EV models from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2030, so that EVs will account for 40pc of its global offerings by fiscal 2026, and 60pc by the end of the decade.The FTSE 100 was subdued as markets opened after a surge at the end of last week pushed it close towards its record high.The UK’s blue chip index was flat at 7,933.12, while the midcap FTSE 250 dropped 0.8pc to 19,572.47.Nuclear minister Andrew Bowie acknowledged that plans for the future of the industry should have been set out “years ago”.The Tories have been in power since 2010 but Mr Bowie said the Government was now “running to catch up”.Firms including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock are partnering with the Government to invest around £763m in skills, jobs and education for defence and civil nuclear industries.But Mr Bowie told Times Radio:I make no bones about it, we should have done this years ago. We are running to catch up.But we have just this year delivered our civil nuclear road map, we have announced our intention to build a third gigawatt project, we are investing £350m in new nuclear power to ease Vladimir Putin out of the nuclear fuels market, we are actually committed to delivering small modular reactors through our competition which will conclude this year.But of course this should have been done years ago, which is why we are having to take the action in the way that we are right now.The owner of South West Water and Bristol Water thinks it will take another year for it to reach a four-star environmental performance rating, it revealed.Pennon Group said that “current operating conditions” mean that it will not achieve the result in the annual Environment Agency performance review.It expects to score two stars, which means that the “company requires improvement” in the year to the end of March 31.Pennon had originally targeted a four-star rating in the year to March 2025.It said in a trading update:Annual rainfall in the South West has increased by 50pc in the second half of the year, when compared to long term averages, in addition to the 10 named storms since September 2023 and 12 yellow weather warnings for rain in the region.The significantly increased wastewater flows have impacted our headline performance for wastewater pollutions and use of storm overflows.B&Q owner Kingfisher insisted it is “strongly positioned for growth” as its business was held back by weaker sales in France and Poland.Bosses blamed a “more challenging consumer backdrop” in its overseas businesses as sales were down 1.8pc on a constant currency basis to just shy of £13bn.Adjusted pre-tax profits fell by more than a quarter to £568m and it predicted earnings of £490m to £550m, which was below analyst estimates of £565.1m.However, the company kept its total dividend at 12.4p and began a new £300m share buyback programme as it said it is aiming for free cash flow of about £450m in 2025 to 2026 and more than £500m the following year.Free cash flow surge to £514m, compared to negative £40m last year but it is predicted to fall to £350m to £410m next year.Its Screwfix brand opened 51 stores in the UK & Ireland to take its overall total to 922 sites, with up to 40 new stores planned this year.It also opened 15 stores in France, taking its overall total to 20 stores, and plans to open another 15 this year, with an overall target of more than 600.Chief executive Thierry Garnier saidIn the UK & Ireland, B&Q, TradePoint and Screwfix each delivered resilient sales and market share growth - in particular very strong gains at Screwfix.In France, where the market has been impacted by low consumer confidence, we have made significant adjustments to the cost base and started to embed e-commerce marketplace and trade customer initiatives similar to those successfully implemented in the UK.Thanks for joining me. Rishi Sunak will today declare that Britain’s nuclear industry is a “critical national endeavour” as he announces a package of investment aimed at boosting skills and jobs amid concerns about defence spending.The Prime Minister will tout a new fund backed by £20m in public money to support growth in Barrow-in-Furness, the Cumbrian town that is home to Britain’s Astute class submarines and Dreadnought programme.He will commit to a further £180m a year over the next decade, which Downing Street says would provide grants to local organisations and improvements to transport and health outcomes in the area.Industry leaders including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock are partnering with the Government to help create more than 8,000 career opportunities in the nuclear industry.They will invest around £763m in skills, jobs and education, which Number 10 hopes will help the sector fill 40,000 new roles by the end of the decade.Ahead of a visit to Barrow-in-Furness later, the Prime Minister said: “Safeguarding the future of our nuclear deterrent and nuclear energy industry is a critical national endeavour.“In a more dangerous and contested world, the UK’s continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent is more vital than ever. And nuclear delivers cheaper, cleaner home-grown energy for consumers.“That’s why we are investing in Barrow, the home of UK submarines, and in the jobs and skills of the future in the thriving British nuclear industry.“Today we usher in the next generation of our nuclear enterprise, which will keep us safe, keep our energy secure, and keep our bills down for good.”1) Wind farms investigated after ‘overcharging customers by £100m’ | Industry faces market manipulation review for allegedly inflating compensation payments when forced to switch off turbines2) Get ready for 3pc interest rates, says KPMG | Economists predict sharp fall in borrowing costs as inflation falls below Bank of England target3) Taxpayer spends £4m on Government lawyers’ home working equipment | Figures emerge amid scrutiny over the productivity of civil servants working remotely4) Stowell: Foreign state ownership of newspapers should be capped at 5pc | Peer urges strict limit on maximum passive investment5) Subpostmaster calls for investigation into legal fees paid by £58m Horizon fund | Regulator is urged to look into how much money went to lawyers and litigation fundersAsian shares were trading mixed, as investors awaited further indications the Federal Reserve might begin cutting interest rates.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.5pc to 16,584.22, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.4pc to 3,061.36.The Chinese yuan, or renminbi, fell to a four-month low against the US dollar.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6pc to 7,813.70.

2024-03-25 18:59:47+00:00,"Apple must secure China as it embarks on legal battles in the U.S. and Europe, Wedbush analyst says: ‘Grab the olive branch from Beijing and don’t look back’","There’s troubled waters under the Apple-China bridge. After the company reported weaker sales in the region, its shares dropped 2.9%, wiping $84 billion off its market valuation. In response, CEO Tim Cook doubled down on Apple’s investments in China: He flew to Shanghai last week to be present for its grand opening for a flagship store in Shanghai, and announced plans to launch Apple’s Vision Pro headset in China later this year.It might take more than a new store to calm the waters. Chinese consumers have been shifting their love from the iPhone to domestic smartphone makers—most notably Shenzhen-based Huawei, whose new high-quality line of Mate 60 smartphones has proved to be fierce competition. Now Apple faces falling sales in the region, its third biggest market—and antitrust actions from the U.S and Europe add salt to the wound.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush, told Fortune “the timing is ironic that Cook is in China while the antitrust issues come from both the US and EU.”“This is a critical time for Apple to grab the olive branch from Beijing and don't look back,” Ives said, adding that “China is key for Apple,” and that the company has struggled to grow there. True enough, Apple’s iPhone sales plummeted 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a Counterpoint Research report. Over that same period, sales for its competitor Huawei surged by 64%.Cook spent several days in China last week—in part to help open the new store, which is Apple’s 57th store in China and the world’s second largest after the one on Fifth Avenue in New York, but he also met with key suppliers, which, according to a note by Wedbush, “was important with worries around a manufacturing supply chain shift out of China into India, Vietnam, and other countries” over the next few years.Ives leaned hopeful: “This trip could start to turn around things in China after a turbulent year.”Turbulent, indeed. Earlier this month, Apple was fined nearly $2 billion by the European Union for anticompetitive music-streaming practices. Apple now faces antitrust actions in the U.S. and Europe—and it’s one of the first to be investigated by the European Union after it passed the Digital Marketing Act, a law implemented in November 2022 that’s aimed at dismantling monopolies and reducing anticompetitive behavior by some of the world’s biggest tech companies.In America, Apple is also at the center of an antitrust lawsuit, filed by the U.S Department of Justice, which alleges Apple’s control of app distribution and programming interfaces suppress technologies like cloud streaming games and cross-platform messaging apps that could otherwise work equally well across different smartphones. Apple said it will defend the claims.The new headwinds, in the form of lawsuit probes, add to the pressure Apple was already facing in China before. Its performance in the region—which accounts for about 20% of its sales, according to the Wedbush note—has been slipping for years. Part of it is because the U.S. and China have been reducing their economic reliance on each other, as seen through a 2019 Trump administration order preventing U.S. tech firms from dealing with Huawei less than two weeks after the Chinese smartphone maker unveiled its trademark Mate 60 Pro phone.In turn, China has invested in its own chips and smartphone parts, while its consumers have used their purchasing power to show solidarity for its domestic smartphone maker. Huawei claimed the second-largest share of the country’s smartphone phone market at 17%, compared to 9% of the share last year, the New York Times reported.To turn things around, Wedbush analysts said Apple will “need to turn around this headwind into a tailwind heading into the iPhone 16 release this Fall and it all starts with reaffirming Apple's presence in China.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-must-secure-china-embarks-185947435.html
2024-03-25 17:35:19+00:00,Top 20 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US,"In this article, we will list the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US. If you want to skip our discussion about the tech industry, visit the Top 7 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US. The worldwide expenditure on technology is projected to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. This depicts an expected 7.75% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years starting in 2022 when the yearly spending on technology was $8,51 trillion. Although the tech industry faced some challenges in 2023, it forged forward and came out strong. The year was also marked by considerable anticipation regarding the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, in the year 2024, companies are looking to prioritize AI in their strategies to surpass competitors. This is the year of AI deals and partnerships which could shape the future. It is already being reported that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Gemini-powered features on iPhones. Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google. Moving forward, spending on software and IT services backed by cloud computing and cyber security is expected to dominate the market. Tech companies will continue to experiment with different AI-related applications. In a survey by Deloitte, 52% of tech leaders stated that AI will be the primary technology in 2024. At 47%, an overwhelming proportion of tech leaders also vouched for could computing. In addition, 27% of the respondents were confident that AI will be a game changer for companies in 2024. The United States is at the forefront of global technology and innovation. It sets the pace for advancements in various sectors. The country also has a whopping 36% share of the global information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In addition, the Consumer Technology Association anticipates that retail revenues for the US consumer technology industry will increase by 2.8% in 2024, reaching $512 billion. While the year 2023 came with challenges for the tech sector, there were big gains for leading tech stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), fueled by the AI boom. Analysts believe that tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation. A new era of gains that started with the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 will continue to reap positive results for the tech sector way beyond 2024.AI is also helping small and mid-cap tech companies make their mark by disrupting larger companies. Theia Insights is one of the examples of small companies with the potential to disrupt entire industries with the help of AI. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of information through AI, and help investors make better decisions. Theia Insights recently also raised $6.5 million. Another AI-related trend in the tech industry is forming partnerships, both within and outside the sector. We have already seen how Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are reported to be in negotiation to integrate generative AI in iPhones. Interestingly, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares went up by 4% following these reports. AI is also compelling tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to partner outside their industry, particularly in the form of vendor and end-user industries collaboration. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India, to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India. Photo by Campaign Creators on UnsplashTo curate our list of the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US, we first proceeded to define Mid-Cap.

2024-03-25 17:28:59+00:00,"Apple, Google, Meta targeted under new European law meant to prevent cornering of digital markets","LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets.The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.The Digital Markets Act that took full effect earlier this month is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services.” Those companies must comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable"" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.The commission has heard complaints that tech companies' measures to comply have fallen short, European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief, said at a press briefing in Brussels.“Today, we decided to investigate a number of these suspected non-compliance issues. And as we unearth other problems, we will tackle those too.""The decision was met with immediate pushback from industry groups like the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a not-for-profit trade group in Washington that represents tech and communications companies.“The timing of these announcements, while the DMA compliance workshops are still ongoing, makes it look like the Commission could be jumping the gun,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""Possible outcomes aside, this move risks confirming industry fears that the DMA compliance process might end up being politicized.”The companies have been ordered to hold on to certain documents that the commission can access in current and future investigations, she said.Regulators are looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to cheaper options available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging recurring fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.Google is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”Google said that it has made “significant changes” to the way its services operate in Europe to comply with the DMA.“We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months,” Google's director of competition, Oliver Bethell, said.The commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers.Apple said it's confident that its plan complies with the DMA, and it will “continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.” The company said it has created a wide range of new developer capabilities, features, and tools to comply with the regulation.The commission is also looking into Meta's option for European users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram, so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.Meta said it will “engage constructively” with the Commission.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,” it said in a prepared statement.The commission said it aims to wrap up its investigations within 12 months.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/european-regulators-investigate-apple-google-100850938.html
2024-03-25 17:05:31+00:00,Apple at risk of £30bn fine after EU launches investigation,"Apple, Meta and Google face fines of billions of euros after the European Union opened the first investigations under new laws designed to rein in Big Tech.Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton, the EU’s competition and digital markets chiefs, announced five investigations into the three companies on Monday.They concern areas including the companies’ smartphone app stores and Meta charging a monthly fee to users in Europe who do not want to see adverts on Facebook and Instagram.It comes less than three weeks after the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force. The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers – Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.In Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn), for Google $30.7bn and for Meta $13.4bn.Earlier this month Apple was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.The investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.The European Commission said the fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.It could mean Meta being forced to offer a version of Instagram and Facebook without personalised adverts for free, which would mark a major challenge to its business model.Mr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”He added that the EU was considering further investigations into Amazon for favouring its own brands in search results, and Apple for rules it imposes on rival iPhone app stores.The investigations show that the EU is seeking to move quickly in enforcing its new laws, after criticism that regulators struggle to keep up with technological changes.Apple said: “We’re confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we’ll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.” Google said: “We have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe,” adding: ”We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.”Meta defended charging users as an alternative to advertising, saying: “We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.”Daniel Friedlaender, the European head of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a lobby group that represents the tech industry, criticised opening the investigations while companies are still going through early “workshops” to work out how to comply with the laws.“The timing of these announcements, while the DMA compliance workshops are still ongoing, makes it look like the Commission could be jumping the gun,” he said. “Possible outcomes aside, this move risks confirming industry fears that the DMA compliance process might end up being politicised.”",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-meta-google-under-investigation-123211653.html
2024-03-25 16:36:42+00:00,Explainer-Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act?,"By Martin CoulterLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.Last year, Brussels designated six companies as ""gatekeepers"" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.They were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.Below is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:ANTI-STEERING:Two of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around ""anti-steering"" behaviour.Whenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.To get around this, app developers sometimes ""steer"" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.Apple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.The EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify, which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.Beyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.SELF-PREFERENCING:In bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.That becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.Another of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking.com or Skyscanner.The EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.WHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?Under the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.The EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.The law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram.In an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a ""pay or be tracked"" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.Following questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.On Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?Google, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.A Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" Meta said.($1 = 0.9233 euros)(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Catherine Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/explainer-why-eu-probing-big-163642500.html

2024-03-25 15:50:16+00:00,"Breaking down the EU’s one-two-three antitrust punch against Apple, Alphabet, and Meta","Hooboy—the European Commission fired an antitrust broadside against some of the biggest tech firms today that could put a major crimp on their businesses. First, let’s quickly break down these three investigations under the new EU Digital Markets Act, then consider the bigger picture.For Apple, I'll begin with what this is not: an investigation into the “core technology fee” that Apple levies on app installations from developers who dare to use the third-party app stores that, under the DMA, must be allowed on iOS in Europe. The Commission is still looking into that matter using “investigatory steps” that fall short of a formal investigation, for now.What was announced today was a two-pronged probe into Apple’s suspected disrespecting of users’ choices—making it too difficult for them to change default iOS settings, search engines, and browsers, and making it impossible to uninstall core apps like Photos—along with failing to let developers freely steer their users to off-platform offers.If those anti-steering tactics sound familiar, that’s because they’re essentially the same reason the Commission just hit Apple with a $2 billion fine under pre-DMA antitrust law and the same reason why Epic Games (aided by Meta, Microsoft, and others) is trying to get a California court to force Cupertino to honor a 2021 injunction about directing users to alternative payment methods. In case you’re wondering, these are among the few Apple tactics that don’t form part of the huge new antitrust case that hit the firm in the U.S. last week.Apple can at least console itself with the knowledge that the Commission isn’t only interested in its potential anti-steering tactics—Android proprietor and Google-parent Alphabet is now being probed over the same thing. What’s more, the Commission wants to find out if Google is “self-preferencing” its own vertical search services like Shopping, Flights, and Hotels in its search results.“Didn’t Google get a $2.7 billion fine over this in 2017?” I hear you ask. Yes, it did, specifically regarding the shopping vertical. Now basically the same issue is back, with a new law in play, and with other industry-specific services joining the party.As for Meta, this one is the logical conclusion of how antitrust and privacy law have been bleeding into each other over the last few years. In order to comply with EU data protection laws, Meta last year started charging European Facebook and Instagram users a monthly fee if they didn’t agree to be tracked for ad-targeting purposes. This “pay or consent” strategy attracted a wave of privacy complaints across the EU, and now it’s being investigated under the bloc’s new antitrust law, which is supposed to stop companies like Meta from abusing their dominant market positions to gather personal data.A Meta spokesperson claimed today that the Subscription for No Ads option had been designed to “address overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA.” Apple also said it was “confident” that it was DMA-compliant. Both companies promised to constructively engage with the Commission during the investigations. No comment from Alphabet just yet.Don’t get me wrong, each one of these cases is fascinating in its own right. But the really interesting thing overall is the urgency with which the Commission has decided to brandish its brand new club, the DMA.When the General Data Protection Regulation came into effect in 2018, the enforcers were national privacy authorities who were under-resourced and understandably wary of getting into expensive legal battles with some of the world’s biggest companies. As a result, those regulators took their sweet time building their cases, and it was more than three years before meaningful GDPR enforcement began.So, with the DMA and its companion law—the Digital Services Act, which tackles illegal content on platforms—the Commission has made itself the enforcer. The true extent of the Commission's capacity in terms of both staff and funding is still an open question, but it has clearly opted to hit hard and early. In a press conference today, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager pointed out that the aim of the law was to get compliance rather than fines (though the DMA does allow fines as high as 10% of global annual revenue)—and the sooner this happens, the better for consumers, she added. The investigations could even wrap up within a year, which is lightning speed for such things.Of course, Big Tech’s lobbyists are appalled. “Launching the first preliminary investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) just days after the compliance deadline throws a wrench into the idea of companies and the European Commission working together to implement the DMA successfully,” spluttered Daniel Friedlaender, the Europe chief of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, in a statement—as though these companies hadn’t had a year and a half to prepare for the compliance date, after the DMA was signed into law in September 2022.Everyone knew this moment was coming. The Big Tech firms carefully crafted their DMA compliance measures to try to get away with as much as they could. The Commission is now pushing back in spectacular fashion.

2024-03-25 15:45:14+00:00,Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer in his latest program took a jab at the Department of Justice and Washington authorities in general, calling regulators “anti-innovation” who have “contempt” against those who became rich in the technology sector. Cramer was referring to the DoJ’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accused the iPhone maker of  throttling competitive alternatives from other companies and trying to maintain a monopoly in the smartphone market. Cramer said that the regulators hate and “abhor” big businesses because the bigger they are the more successful they become. Jim Cramer, who has been repeatedly recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) during his programs, uring investors to “hold it, not trade it,” said that Washington’s “anti-business bias” was evident when it brought the lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on what Cramer called a “shameful day.”Cramer then highlighted the reasons why he’s been so bullish on Apple, and these thoughts provide an interesting sneak peek into what goes on in Cramer’s mind when he’s choosing stocks for the long-term. Cramer said he did not ask his viewers to hold Apple stock for the long term because it’s a stock with a relatively low P/E ratio or because it has “got the hottest technology out there?” These were not the reasons behind Cramer’s bullish outlook on Apple. Cramer said he recommended holding onto Apple shares because it’s the “most innovative consumer products technology company ever.”In a blunt move, Cramer grabbed a copy of the DoJ’s case against Apple and threw it away, calling it a “loser” case which does not hold any merit. Cramer said that he isn’t worried at all about the DoJ’s case against Apple because he knows a “loser case” when he “sees it.” According to Cramer, Apple pays the “most taxes” and creates the “most jobs.”Cramer said the pullback in Apple shares after the case was expected, but he sees it as a buying opportunity which long-term investors would look back to and thank the Department of Justice for.While Jim Cramer is recommending investors to pile into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in addition to other tech names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), he is bearish on some stocks. In this article we will take a look at the stocks he's recommending investors to stay away from.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 5Jim Cramer was recently asked about midstream energy infrastructure company Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA). Cramer said:“I see you, and I raise you with Enterprise Products Partners.”Cramer also said that Enterprise Products Partners is a “better” company than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA).Last month, during its earnings call, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA) management talked about guidance and expectations:""Looking at 2024 compared to 2023 and as illustrated by the EBITDA walk on Slide 9, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.625 billion to $2.725 billion with year-over-year growth in our Crude Oil segment, partially offsetting commodity price headwinds in our NGL segment. Growth in our Crude Oil segment is primarily driven by anticipated tariff volume increases, higher fees from tariff escalators and full year contributions from bolt-on acquisitions. This is partially offset by our assumption of fewer market-based opportunities. We expect lower year-over-year NGL segment adjusted EBITDA, driven by lower forecasted frac spreads, partially offset by higher C3 plus spec product sales in 2024. I would note that our C3 plus spec product sales volumes are approximately 90% hedged for the year in the mid $0.60 per gallon level.We remain disciplined with our capital investments with approximately $375 million of growth capital and approximately $230 million of maintenance capital expected for the year, net to PAA. This includes capital for POP JV well connections and intra-basin improvement as well as an increase in our capital related to our previously announced Fort Sask debottleneck project. As illustrated on Slide 10 and in addition to a capital discipline, we remain committed to significant returns of capital and maintaining financial ability. For 2024, we expect to generate $1.65 billion of adjusted free cash flow excluding changes in assets and liabilities with approximately $1.15 billion to be allocated to common and preferred distributions inclusive of the respective increases resulting in $500 million of adjusted free cash flow after distributions available for value-creating opportunities, including potential bolt-on acquisitions or net debt reduction.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 13AI-based voice technology solutions company Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another stock Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from for now. While Cramer has expressed excitement about the stock in the past because of Soundhound AI Inc's (NASDAQ:SOUN) partnership with Nvidia, the CNBC host recently said that he won’t buy the stock even at $6 (the stock was trading at around $6.14 as of March 25).Out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 13 hedge funds had stakes in Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18Texas-based energy company Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently avoiding.

2024-03-25 15:10:36+00:00,"Consumers sue Apple, taking page from US Justice Department lawsuit","By Mike Scarcella(Reuters) - Apple has been hit with a flurry of new consumer lawsuits accusing the iPhone maker of monopolizing the smartphone market, piggybacking on a sweeping antitrust case lodged by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states last week.At least three proposed class actions have been filed since Friday in California and New Jersey federal courts by iPhone owners who claim Apple inflated the cost of its products through anticompetitive conduct.The lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets and other items that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones.Apple has denied the government's allegations. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consumer lawsuits.Attorney Steve Berman, whose law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro filed one of the new cases, noted that his firm had earlier sued Apple for allegedly thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.""We are pleased that the DOJ (Department of Justice) agrees with our approach,"" Berman said.Attorneys behind the other new cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Apple is already fighting private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive. A judge in February ruled that Apple must face a class action on behalf of millions of consumers claiming it monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple denies the claims.Hagens Berman previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases related to its ebook pricing and app store policies.A 2022 study by a University of Buffalo law school professor found that private antitrust class actions can sometimes go farther than government cases, expanding ""the scope of wrongdoing, the amount of recovery, or the number of defendants involved.""(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Will Dunham and David Bario)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/consumers-sue-apple-taking-page-151036526.html

I know the street consensus for this year is for slightly down earnings, but if you look at the reality of the first half of this year, you see that mac sales are up slightly, and you'll see that iPhone sales are up a few percentage points, and they're doing well in every region, excluding greater China.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Another crackdown on big tech. This time, coming from the EU. The commission going after Meta, Alphabet, and Apple. The statement saying that the EU has, quote, ""opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act into Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice for screen for Safari, and Meta's pay or consent models.""Let's talk about what this means for the big tech giant. For Apple, specifically for that, I want to bring in Jim Kelleher. He is Argus director of research here to weigh in.Jim, it's good to see you. So I know you have a buy rating on Apple. You had that buy reading, reiterated that buy rating following the legal update that we got from the DOJ lawsuit against Apple last week. How are you looking at the fact that-- or what does this potentially mean to Apple's bottom line, the fact that now you also potentially have more pressure coming from the EU as well?JIM KELLEHER: So good morning, Seana and Madison. What I would, generally, say is we've followed a lot of companies that have spent a lot of time in the courts over the years, such as Qualcomm. And these things do tend to drag on for a long time, when the government feels that there are unfair practices.What I would say is, I expect over the long term, when I do expect this to take a while to play out, Apple will negotiate and grant some degree of openness to its ecosystem. At the same time, the immense core of Apple and iOS users is going to stay loyal to the company.That's what I'm thinking right now. The impacts on the bottom line are a little hard to quantify. Just looking at Apple's response to the DOJ complaint, they, basically, didn't say, we didn't do it, nor did they say, we're not going to do it in the future.They stood on their principles of how they operate their ecosystem. And said, we're always interested in the security of our devices, first and foremost. So I would look really at the Apple fundamentals. And I'd be willing to discuss those in a moment as being more indicative of the near-- I should say long-term stock drivers.MADISON MILLS: Well, I want to stay on the investigations for a second, because I'm curious if this EU investigation to you felt like a bigger deal than what we saw here in the US.JIM KELLEHER: All right. Well, on a preliminary basis, it looks as if they're also going after the fact that the App Store seems too inclusive, that developers are under compensated, that there's an effective firewall preventing the apps from working as well or working outside the App Store.So I think there will be negotiations all down the line, as this thing unfolds. And Apple will give a little. And EU will give a little. And DOJ will give a little. And, ultimately, the Apple-- the velvet rope will be let down a little bit. The Apple ecosystem will be a little bit more open. But, ultimately, I think Apple will do everything in its power. And I think it does have some power to preserve most of its ecosystem.SEANA SMITH: Jim, I'm curious, at least, with the antitrust case here in the DOJ. There has been some worry starting to trickle through what Apple might be potentially forced to reveal in terms of their business offerings, because we know they're tight lipped. And we don't really get a good look at that.Do you think they are going to be able to maintain some of those confidential arrangements? Or how do you see that potentially playing out?JIM KELLEHER: Again, I think these are things that are a little more on the sidelines. Apple, I don't think there's enormous smoking guns in there. I don't think Apple is behaving unethically. I think they've been operating in the same way they've always been operating.So I'm not expecting big revelations. The confidentiality is going to unmask some horrendous goings on. What I'm focused on right now is the fact that Apple seems to be turning around its operations. If you look at 2023, the stock was up 48%. And yet, at this time a year, ago, in other words, at the fiscal half year mark, Mac sales were down in double digits in revenue. IPhone sales were down about 5%. Overall revenue was down.Now, I know the Street consensus for this year is for slightly down earnings. But if you look at the reality of the first half of this year, you see that Mac sales are up slightly. And you'll see that iPhone sales are up a few percentage points. And they're doing well in every region, excluding greater China. And that's as expected.So I think we're going to see a couple surprise quarters coming forward. And I think we'll do well from here. And devaluation-wise, the stock's trading in line with its five-year historical multiple at a time when big tech names are trading at huge premiums to where they've traded in the past five years.MADISON MILLS: Right. But it's interesting to note that Apple's stock is down about 8% year-to-date still, though, Jim.Thank you so much for joining us. We know we've got to let you go. Really appreciate it.

2024-03-25 15:00:00+00:00,"Like the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks? You'll Love This Vanguard ETF.","The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks have dominated the stock market narrative over the last year, and it's easy to see why.This group of elite tech stocks, which includes Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), returned more than 100% in 2023, and it's off to a good start in 2024, up 17% on average through March 21.However, the Magnificent Seven might not be as magnificent going forward. First, the group of tech stocks has already attracted a lot of attention on Wall Street and among retail investors, arguably lifting valuations beyond where they should be. Second, some members of the group don't look as solid as they once did.Tesla stock, for example, is down 30% this year as electric vehicle sales growth is plateauing, prices in the industry have come down, and the company's production growth is slowing. Apple has also been a stock market loser this year as the iPhone maker has faced headwinds in China, its revenue growth is flatlining, and the Department of Justice just sued Apple, claiming it has a monopoly.Meanwhile, even the Magnificent Seven's top performers like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are likely to slow down as much of their future growth is already baked into their current stock prices.Nvidia has been the leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but with its market cap already at $2.3 billion, it would be difficult for the stock to post eye-popping gains from here. Similarly, Meta Platforms has also been a big winner, but much of the surge in profits that came from its cost-cutting has already taken place and won't be repeated.In other words, it looks like the best days of the Magnificent Seven are behind it. If you're looking to move beyond the Magnificent Seven, there's one Vanguard exchange-traded fund (ETF) that looks like a perfect match for investors looking for growth potential in a new bull market. That's the Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF (NYSEMKT: VFMO). Here's why it looks like a winner.The Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in stocks with the potential to generate higher returns and stocks with a strong recent performance as measured by their performance at multiple intervals over the last year.The fund chooses from the 3,000 largest stocks, represented by the Russell 3000, and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, the Vanguard Momentum ETF is diversified across multiple sectors with 29% of the fund in technology, 19% in industrials, 17% in consumer discretionary, and 15% in healthcare, with the remainder spread across the stock market.The Vanguard Momentum ETF's top two holdings are actually Meta Platforms and Nvidia, but they make up less than 4% of the fund's total value. The rest of the top five includes General Electric, Arista Networks, and Broadcom.The VFMO ETF has 574 stocks, showing that it's well diversified, and the ETF is growing faster and is cheaper than the benchmark Russell 3000. Over the last five years, the portfolio stocks have grown 19.2% and the fund has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.3, making it cheaper than the S&P 500.The fund has also performed well so far this year, up 15.4%, just shy of the average of the Magnificent Seven, though that is distorted by the success of Nvidia, which is up 84% this year.Momentum stocks tend to do well in bull markets as investors recognize them and jump on as they climb. That helps explain the soaring returns of stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.With a new bull market that could just be starting, finding a diversified growth stock fund makes sense, and the Vanguard Momentum ETF is just that. Look for the VRMO ETF to continue to outperform the S&P 500 no matter what happens moving forward.Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Wellington Fund - Vanguard U.s.

That’s considerably more than the $10,000+ RR Auction had expected it to sell for.The card was a rarity and one of the earliest business cards bearing Jobs’ signature. To date, there are fewer than five Jobs-signed Apple Computer business cards that have been authenticated.“The sale of the Steve Jobs-signed Apple business card for over $180,000 sets a new standard in autographed business cards,” said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction, in a statement. “It’s a testament to the enduring legacy of Jobs and the profound impact of Apple on our modern world.”Fetching just a bit less was a check signed by Jobs. In 1976, that check was worth $13.86 to Elmar Electronics. It sold for $176,850. The check pre-dated the official founding of Apple Computer. It was likely used to purchase electronic components that were used in the construction of the first Apple-1 prototypes. Because the company did not yet officially exist, Jobs wrote “Apple Computer” as well as the address of his Palo Alto garage in the top left corner.The pre-auction estimate for the check was $50,000+.Jobs typically did not sign autographs, but made an exception for a random fan in 2003 who swapped his seat during a showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl so Jobs and his family could all sit together.“I was seated at the back of the room patiently waiting for the movie to begin when a man accompanied by some children tapped on my shoulder and kindly asked me if I could move by one seat so that they could all comfortably sit together. I gladly accepted and while I was moving, I suddenly realized that I had just spoken to Steve Jobs,” read a letter from the original recipient that accompanied the item. “I did not want to potentially upset him before he could happily enjoy the movie, so I chose to wait until we were leaving the room to address him. … His response was ‘Sure’ and as I had no paper on me, the only thing I could hand him was a pen and my movie ticket that he signed in the palm of his hand.”That ticket stub sold for $14,653.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-145741410.html

MeijerBRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies.The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover.U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.Tech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six ""gatekeepers"" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices.But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.Asked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.""The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,"" he told a press conference.APPLE COMPLIANCEAt issue is whether Apple complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.Another concern for regulators is ""steering"": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes.Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.FEES OR NO FEESThe Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's ""free of charge"" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.Breton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.A Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" the spokesperson said.Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.The Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon's ranking practices on its marketplace.Amazon is another DMA ""gatekeeper"", along with Microsoft and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.""Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. ""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.""The EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.The EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bart Meijer; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Catherine Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/1-eu-target-apple-google-103119823.html

The commission going after Meta, Alphabet, and Apple. The statement says the EU has opened noncompliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act into Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search. Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta's is for pay or consent models.So let's just break that down a little bit further here. So for Alphabet and Apple steering rules, what they say is that the commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures that have been implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the Digital Markets Act requiring gatekeepers to allow app developers to steer consumers to offers outside of the app stores free of charge there.And that's something that's come up time and time again. And really, has been kicked off by some of the companies who were calling about this for years and saying, hey, can you guys look into this? They're taking revenues from us or just barring us from the opportunity to realize revenue because of that steering that's taken place.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And the impact that this could potentially have on the bottom line, just putting this in perspective in terms of what this means for Apple's business, the EU accounts for about 7% of App Store revenues. So it is a significant part of their business. And then, of course, the question is, if this happens over in the EU, what exactly will more of that pressure look like here in the US?We had the DOJ lawsuit separate issue, obviously. But the DOJ lawsuit, yes, last week-- excuse me-- pertaining to Apple and some of the concerns there over the monopoly. But then if you move that aside and move also the issues with Alphabet aside, similar sort of scenario there just in terms of their questions about Google Play. But then focus on Meta and what the argument is there.Because that's something that also stuck out to me. You have this pay and consent model, which is looking at the ad subscription model versus whether or not you're going to opt in and let meta share your data. So very separate issues here, but there is pressure across the board on these stocks here in the premarket. You've got Apple down another 1% potentially.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/european-union-opens-investigations-top-140222399.html

To skip the detailed analysis of financial markets and analysts’ outlook, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren.The world held its breath for almost three years as the global financial markets and economy suffered from one shock after another. The bears were sure that the US economy would be hit by a recession in 2023 or 2024, but the market proved all their predictions wrong and made an impressive comeback on the back of artificial intelligence (AI).While the bulls are quite optimistic about the future, there are still concerns regarding a soft landing or a mild recession. A JPMorgan report points out that there are indications of slowing growth in the current year but not a total collapse and still holds the belief that a mild recession could take place in the next year. The report states:“The challenge for investors: the damage to public sector finances from mega-deficits, markets that already price in a very soft landing and the concentrated contribution of megacap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings were flat; they were up 33% for the 7 megacap stocks and down 5% across the rest of the S&P 500. All things considered, 2024 looks like a year of slowing GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth and single-digit returns on the median S&P 500 stock.”On a global scale, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report also contains revisions regarding the IMF’s October 2023 predictions and states that the global growth is expected to be 3.1% in 2024, up 0.2% from the IMF's October predictions. The IMF predicts a 3.2% growth in 2025. Furthermore, it is believed that global headline inflation is expected to fall by 5.8% in the current year and 4.4% in 2025.In this economic environment and volatility, millions of American families would wonder how they could help their children and grandchildren secure their financial future. One of the best ways to do that would be to teach them money management. According to the Wall Street legend, Warren Buffett, sometimes parents start teaching financial literacy to their children later than they should. He said:“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”Buying stocks for your children or grandchildren is also a good way to secure their financial future. Value stocks are some of the best options when looking at long-term investments. They are stocks of companies that are considered to be undervalued compared to their intrinsic value or potential for growth. Value stocks have also been endorsed by Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel for the current year. In a CNBC interview, he mentioned the abnormal gap between the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value. Based on that, he predicts a 15% gain in value stocks in 2024. Additionally, the best stocks to buy for grandchildren could include stocks with healthy long-term dividends.A close-up of the NASDAQ ticker board displaying the stock increase of a Dallas-based company.Our MethodologyFor this article, we took a look at our article, 12 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child, and checked the portfolio composition of all the ETFs and index funds mentioned in it.

2024-03-25 13:54:25+00:00,"Apple, Google and Meta at risk of ‘heavy’ fines as Europe launches new probes","The European Union has launched investigations into Apple, Google and Facebook parent Meta on suspicion that they are failing to comply with a new landmark European law designed to promote competition in digital services.The European Commission said it “suspects” that various practices by all three companies “fall short of effective compliance” with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect earlier this month. If the probes find a “lack of full compliance,” they could face “heavy fines,” said European Commissioner Thierry Breton.The DMA requires dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. It currently applies to the three tech giants under investigation, as well as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.By mid-May, the list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the EU has said.Violations of the new law can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.The practices the European Commission is investigating include what it calls Meta’s “pay or consent” approach. Last October, Meta (META) launched a subscription service, called “Subscription for no ads,” allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to €12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions.“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by (large companies),” the body said in a statement.A Meta spokesperson responded: “Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed ‘Subscription for no ads’ to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.”The EU is also looking into app stores operated by Apple (AAPL) and Google. The DMA states that large digital platforms — so-called gatekeepers — must allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the two dominant stores, free of charge.Among other concerns, the EU suspects that Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) constrain developers’ ability “to freely communicate (with end-users) and promote offers and directly conclude contracts, including by imposing various charges,” the Commission said.“We are concerned Alphabet, Apple & Meta & are not meeting their obligations, e.g.: Apple & Alphabet still charge recurring fees to app developers,” European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager wrote on X Monday.Apple’s “choice screen” for Safari is also under scrutiny, the European Commission said. Under the DMA, Apple must prompt users with “choice screens which must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones,” it noted.Apple told CNN in a statement: “We’re confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we’ll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.”Another of the Commission’s concerns pertains to Google Search. Alphabet may not have done enough to ensure that third-party services appearing in search results are treated in “a fair and non-discriminatory manner” compared with Alphabet’s own services, such as Google Shopping and Google Flights.Oliver Bethell, a competition executive at Google, said in a statement: “To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe.“We have engaged with the European Commission, stakeholders and third parties in dozens of events over the past year to receive and respond to feedback, and to balance conflicting needs within the ecosystem. We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.”This story has been updated with additional information.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-google-meta-risk-heavy-114530507.html

The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers – Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.In Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn). It comes just weeks after it was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.The investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.The European Commission said Meta’s fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.Mr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses.

2024-03-25 12:00:00+00:00,Best ETF Areas of Last Week,"Wall Street delivered an upbeat performance last week due to dovish Fed cues. The S&P 500 added 2.3%, the Dow Jones advanced 2% and the Nasdaq rose about 2.9%.  There was growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates as the U.S. central bank sticked to its previous projections of three rate cuts despite recently-released hot inflation data.On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged and projected three rate cuts this year. During the news conference, Chair Powell acknowledged that inflation had been more persistent than expected over the past two months but expressed hope that inflation was on a sustainable path back to 2%.The central bank expects solid economic growth and the unemployment rate to remain at a low level. Powell noted that a strong job market wouldn’t deter the central bank from reducing rates. Stocks soared after the press conference.While technology stocks – being high-growth in nature – continue to perform well, the rally has broadened, with a clear resurgence in mid- and small-cap stocks recently. The financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain.The Magnificent Seven - Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year, per a Reuters article.BoJ (Bank of Japan) hiked its short-term interest rates to around 0% to 0.1% from -0.1%, according to its statement at the end of its two-day March policy meeting. It marked the first rate-hike in 17 years, putting an end to the world’s only negative rates regime on signs of robust wage gains this year.

2024-03-25 11:44:01+00:00,"Apple, Google, Meta targeted under new European law to prevent cornering of digital markets","LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets.The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.The Digital Markets Act that took full effect earlier this month is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services.” Those companies must comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable"" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.The commission has heard complaints that tech companies' measures to comply have fallen short, European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief, said at a press briefing in Brussels.“Today, we decided to investigate a number of these suspected non-compliance issues. And as we unearth other problems, we will tackle those too.""The companies have been ordered to hold on to certain documents that the commission can access in current and future investigations, she said.Regulators are looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to cheaper options available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging recurring fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.Google is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”Google said that it has made “significant changes” to the way its services operate in Europe to comply with the DMA.“We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months,” Google's director of competition, Oliver Bethell, said.The commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers.Apple said it's confident that its plan complies with the DMA, and it will “continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.” The company said it has created a wide range of new developer capabilities, features, and tools to comply with the regulation.The commission is also looking into Meta's option for European users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram, so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.Meta said it will “engage constructively” with the Commission.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,” it said in a prepared statement.The commission said it aims to wrap up its investigations within 12 months.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/european-regulators-investigate-apple-google-100850938.html

2024-03-25 09:29:02+00:00,"Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech","By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha MukherjeeBRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DOIt is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, additional reporting by Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Ken Li and Anna Driver)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/analysis-google-apple-breakups-agenda-010424313.html
2024-03-25 09:06:00+00:00,Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead,"It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.The wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat.One company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.Whereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the ""Magnificent Seven,"" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.Super Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.But not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares soldKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares soldIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares soldWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.Furthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.But while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks.Billionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchasedDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchasedMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).Amazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.Selling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.A second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:Nvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchasedAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchasedNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.At the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.Griffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.Don't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.The final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchasedApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchasedBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.Alphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.But Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.Meanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.However, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution. Artificial intelligence products like automated assistants, chatbots, robotics, and even self-driving vehicles have become all the rage in the media over the past few years, propelling the cutting edge tech industry to the forefront of global growth. According to a report by professional services firm PwC, the global AI market will contribute more than $15.7 trillion to the world economy by the end of this decade. This number is more than the economic output of powerhouses like China and India combined. In the next few years, per an analysis by research firm Grand View Research, the AI market is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of a scary 37%. China and the United States are expected to lead this boom in the AI world. AI will contribute to a nearly 30% increase in total GDP output from China by 2030, with North America following behind at around 15%. AI growth trends can be seen in context of the ChatGPT craze. The application became the fastest-growing in history by hitting 100 million active users within a month of launch.Some of the most promising applications for AI include uses in wearable technology, chip market solutions, self-driving cars, and automated medical procedures, among a host of other applications in the business world. Global Market Insights estimates that the wearable AI market will reach close to $200 billion in value by the end of next year. Similarly, more than 8 billion digital voice assistants could be in use worldwide by the end of this year. The global AI chip market will reach close to $100 billion in value within the next three years. Big companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing heavily in AI products to take advantage of this AI evolution. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), recently highlighted some of the efforts his company was making in this regard during the first quarter earnings call at the beginning of February. “Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.”Our MethodologyThe companies that stand to benefit from the increased adoption of AI products and related services were selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment.

2024-03-24 13:31:11+00:00,Apple’s Cook Tells China Forum AI Is Key for Climate Battle,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said artificial intelligence is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog Sunday at the China Development Forum.Most Read from BloombergTrump Bond Cut By 68% to $175 Million as He Appeals NY FineTrump Facing Moment of Truth for Finances in Manhattan CourtBoeing CEO to Step Down in Overhaul Sparked by Safety CrisisAfter Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest DeductionCook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company’s commitment to China. He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple’s supply chain, stores and research in the country.Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint — with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon neutral product. Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.“We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,” Cook said of the company’s environmental goals. Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.AI “provides an enormous toolkit for every company that’s wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,” the 63-year-old CEO said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person’s carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.Like Apple, China’s leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest, however US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.The Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year’s list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China Premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li’s opening speech.Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because “it’s so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming.” His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.Read More: Apple CEO Arrives in China Touting Its Role as iPhone Base“To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,” Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co., Lens Technology Co. and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.The environmental theme to Cook’s trip — which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai on Thursday — may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the US and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner doesn’t divest.Apple has been on the receiving end of China’s riposte, as it’s had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.The company’s global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.Apple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 metric tons of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network. It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly in China.(Updates with details of Cook’s visit from second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-24 12:00:00+00:00,Meet the 4 Worst-Performing Dow Stocks in 2024 (and It Could Get Worse Before It Gets Better),"The broader stock market continues to roar higher. But 11 of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down this year.The worst performers, in order, are Boeing (NYSE: BA), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nike (NYSE: NKE), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- which may come as a surprise, since the broader semiconductor industry and many big tech growth stocks are flying high.Here's what's dragging down each blue-chip stock, and why it could get worse before it gets better.Boeing has not had a good 2024. On Jan. 5, a Boeing 737-9 MAX door plug came off mid-flight. Since then, Boeing has been scrambling to restore confidence and ensure safety.On Jan. 24, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that it would halt Boeing MAX's production expansion and investigate Boeing's maintenance and quality control.On March 4, the FAA ""...found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. The FAA identified non-compliance issues in Boeing's manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.""On March 20, Boeing said that it would slow production and burn more cash in an effort to improve quality.Cases like this are never good, especially when they have to do with safety. As for the company, Boeing's 2025/2026 medium-term targets are in jeopardy. Boeing was guiding for $10 billion in annual free cash flow during that time frame, but it will probably miss that goal now.Boeing continues to hit speed bumps along an increasingly uncertain runway. The stock got crushed during the COVID-19 pandemic as travel ground to a halt. It largely missed out on the broader market rally, and remains down over 57% from its all-time high.Boeing used to be the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow. But now it is closer to the median. Investor patience is running out, and the stock could struggle before staging a turnaround.Intel had a fantastic year in 2023, surging 90%. The recovery was mainly due to investor optimism that Intel is finally on track. But that doesn't mean its precious wasted opportunities are completely forgotten.Intel is an excellent example of why the top dog in a dynamic industry can lose its throne in a relatively short period of time. Intel lost market share in the CPU market and missed out on the AI-driven GPU boom. Intel believes it can unlock growth in the foundry business and become the second-largest foundry by 2030.Size isn't the only differencing factor. Supported by government funding, Intel is building foundries across the United States to onshore semiconductor production. This presents an opportunity for American chip makers to reduce the geopolitical risks of relying too much on Taiwan. Granted, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also investing in U.S. fabs.Intel stock was left for dead but now has hope. After last year's run-up, it's understandable why the stock would pull back given that much of its potential growth is years away.Nike is facing two key threats. The first is slowing growth out of China. On its Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call, Nike revised its full-year revenue guidance to just 1% growth compared to fiscal 2023. Softness out of China, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa was largely responsible for the revision.Nike has always dealt with competition, but it seems to be ramping up in recent years. Lululemon sustained breakneck growth and is now worth nearly 40% as much as Nike. Smaller footwear and apparel brands like On Holding and Hoka have taken the market by storm. Hoka is owned by Deckers Outdoor, which also owns UGG and Teva.Nike is a bigger company, so moving the needle is harder. But still, trailing 12-month revenue is up just 15.8% over the last three years, which is a bad look compared to Lululemon, On, and Deckers.Nike relies heavily on massive marketing expenses and its brand. Perception is everything when it comes to charging a premium price for what is ultimately just a commodity.The good news is that the valuation has come down. Nike's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now just 29.3, which is far lower than the five-year median of 34.6.Nike is too good of a company to trade at a discount to the market. Value investors will eventually step in and swoop up shares, but the bulk of Nike's sell-off thus far is justified.Apple's sell-off also makes sense. The growth rate of the stock price has far exceeded profit growth, which has made the stock more expensive.Apple is dealing with slowing growth out of China and decent growth elsewhere. However, optimistic investors hope that Apple has a hidden backlog in the form of customers who have older iPhone models and are overdue for an upgrade. This pent-up demand could help Apple get back on track. But the fact remains that iPhone sales growth slowed dramatically, and Apple's business model still greatly depends on the iPhone. And a recent development demands attention -- the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Apple accusing it of illegally stifling competition and violating antitrust laws to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and less likely to switch to another device.To its credit, Apple's high-margin services segment is thriving and continues to put up record results. Apple also bought back a considerable amount of stock, which has helped its earnings per share (EPS) growth outpace net income growth. The impact of stock buybacks doesn't always appear in the short term. But given the pace at which Apple repurchases shares, you can begin to see the divergence over the medium term.Referring back to the chart, consider that Apple's net income is up 76.5% over the last five years but EPS is up 116% thanks to buybacks. Apple's steadfast buybacks make the stock a better value even when growth is slow.Out of all the companies on this list, Apple stands out as the best long-term investment because parts of the business are doing well, it has a rock-solid balance sheet and plenty of cash to make an acquisition to fuel growth if needed, and it remains a market leader. In the meantime, Apple could continue underperforming the broader market until its fundamentals improve.Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-24 11:30:00+00:00,A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Warren Buffett Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Keep an Eye On,"Warren Buffett, despite long avoiding the technology sector, has made Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) the largest holding at the conglomerate he heads, Berkshire Hathaway. No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-24 11:15:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"One of the best investments you can make is to buy shares of a financially strong company that makes products millions of people use every day.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two such companies that come first to mind. These are hugely successful businesses that churn out billions of dollars in free cash flow, an important measure of profitability, and they each have made shareholders a lot of money over the years. Here's why these two stocks are ideal buy-and-hold investments.There are not many businesses as entrenched and positioned for above-average growth over the long term as Amazon. Last year, it controlled a 37% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, according to Statista. Walmart was a distant second with only a 6% share. This puts Amazon in a great position to capture more retail spending that will shift online. E-commerce made up just 15% of U.S. retail sales in 2023.When you're going to invest in a company with the intention of holding it forever, it's ideal to choose a business with a large customer base. Amazon checks that box, with more than 200 million Prime members and counting.It's also important to invest in companies that generate growing free cash flow. Amazon's free cash flow dipped in 2022 as the company accelerated investment in its delivery speed and transportation network. With those investments behind it, Amazon generated $32 billion in free cash flow on $574 billion of revenue last year.Amazon continues to expand its inventory selection and same-day delivery. It's also investing heavily to increase streaming content for Prime Video. These are important advantages that attract new Prime members and ultimately deliver returns to shareholders.Amazon is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which management sees as an opportunity to reinvent its customer experiences in retail and its cloud business. Investors like the company's progress, which is why the stock is up 77% over the last 12 months and close to a new all-time high. But there's still a huge opportunity in e-commerce for new investors to do well with Amazon over the long term.Apple is another top brand that will make a rewarding buy-and-hold investment. The number of active Apple devices hit another all-time high last quarter at more than 2.2 billion.It might be difficult to see how Apple can continue growing with so many users already, but the smartphone market is expected to increase by $75 billion by 2028 to be worth $542 billion. This gives the tech titan a tailwind to gradually grow its iPhone revenue, which is its largest business. iPhone revenue rose 6% year over year last quarter, driven by a record number of people upgrading.Where Apple really makes its money is selling users additional services, such as subscriptions to Apple Music and iCloud plans. Apple services generate twice the gross profit margin as devices, which is a long-term catalyst to continue growing the company's tremendous $106 billion in annual free cash flow.Apple won't rest on its laurels. Like Amazon, it is investing in AI that could transform the user experience on the iPhone and may even win over new converts from other brands. Apple is reportedly in discussions with Google to bring generative AI features to iPhones.New product releases will also keep its installed base of devices growing. Its new Vision Pro headset may take a few years to catch on with the public, but Apple has major ambitions to influence how people interact with apps and computing tasks for decades to come, much like it did with the first iPhone in 2007.After climbing 48% in 2023, the shares have pulled back this year, providing a good buying opportunity for new investors. Apple's strong brand and growing free cash flow are reasons the stock will remain a rewarding investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-24 11:15:00+00:00,"If the ""Magnificent Seven"" Is So Great, Then Why Is Tesla the Worst-Performing S&P 500 Stock in 2024?","All the Magnificent Seven stocks beat the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 last year. That quality, paired with each company's size, led Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to coin the phrase ""Magnificent Seven"" to refer to Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). But 2024 has been entirely different.Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla are underperforming both benchmarks, with Apple losing over 8% of its value year to date. Tesla has been the most contentious component of the Magnificent Seven because it is the worst-performing S&P stock YTD, down over 30% in less than three months. Even Boeing, whose stock tumbled following a series of high-profile maintenance issues, is doing slightly better than Tesla stock.Nvidia is the single best-performing stock in the S&P 500, and Meta Platforms is third.Here's why some Magnificent Seven stocks are out of favor, what you can learn from the Magnificent Seven, and whether investing in the Magnificent Seven is right for you.In 2022, the Nasdaq Composite and many big tech stocks suffered brutal inflation-driven sell-offs as recession fears spread like wildfire. The market breathed a sigh of relief in 2023 when inflation started coming down, and there was a path toward the Federal Reserve cutting rates.Widespread adoption of ChatGPT gave the market a new theme to get excited about: artificial intelligence (AI). AI is nothing new, but the proliferation of AI tools in the workplace and for everyday tasks is.Wall Street can get enamored by a hot trend, creating tunnel vision and ignoring opportunities that fall outside the construct. The Magnificent Seven components that are leveraging AI and have a clear roadmap for using AI to fuel earnings growth have been rewarded. Those that don't, namely Apple and Tesla, have been punished.In my opinion, the companies with the best AI potential focus on business-to-business sales more than business-to-consumer sales.Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft mainly sell software and digital ads. Meta Platforms' social media platforms Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp primarily cater to consumers, but the revenue comes from ads sold to companies. Nvidia sells a physical product (the computing power necessary to support complex AI models) to companies.Amazon's e-commerce arm depends on consumers, but Amazon Web Services is the cloud infrastructure leader and arguably the most valuable part of the business.Meanwhile, Apple and Tesla depend on selling physical products, mainly iPhones for Apple and electric vehicles (EVs) for Tesla. Selling physical products to consumers is the hardest way to monetize AI. Yes, there are exceptions, but this has so far been the case with the AI boom.Tesla doesn't have a clear way to monetize AI in the near term. Its best bets are long-term, fully autonomous driving and robotaxis, but that industry remains unproven.Apple also doesn't have a clear AI roadmap. Sure, Apple will probably integrate AI into its future devices, and the company is doing an excellent job of growing its high-margin services segment. But overall, Apple and Tesla haven't been able to capitalize on AI meaningfully, which may not change anytime soon simply because of the nature of their business models.In fact, analysts are forecasting next-to-no growth for Apple in the short term, which is why its price-to-earnings ratio is nearly the same as its forward P/E. Tesla's forward P/E ratio is lower, implying negative growth.Tesla stock had a lot in common with its other big-tech-focused peers. But the business is totally different.Investors who piled into Tesla all because it was part of the Magnificent Seven have been burned. The sell-off is a good lesson on why chasing a hot trend or assuming a stock will stay correlated when the underlying companies are so different is never a good idea.Tesla's sell-off has been severe not only because it has been left out of the AI theme but also because it is facing growing competition from pure-play EV companies and legacy automakers alike. It has been battling a price war for a while now, with further price cuts expected to fend off slowing demand and low-cost offerings in China, namely from BYD. At this stage, Tesla has lost its first-mover advantage, so its supply chain, manufacturing expertise, unique product features, and brand will be more important than ever. Consumers interested in EVs have more choices -- a reality that Tesla has to accept.Even after the sell-off, Tesla remains the most expensive Magnificent Seven stock on a forward P/E ratio basis.With the growth story falling apart, at least in the short term, it is understandable why some investors are running for the exits. But as bad as it looks, the long-term investment thesis for Tesla hasn't changed.Tesla is focused on rapidly scaling production to meet the needs of sustained EV adoption. The adoption rate depends on consumer interest and government mandates/subsidies for EVs. For Tesla to unlock long-term growth, it must play a central role in the energy transition through EVs, EV charging, renewable energy, energy storage, and more.Right now, EV demand has slowed. And the renewable energy industry been crushed due to high interest rates and lower investor enthusiasm.When you add it all up, this is a perfect storm of negativity hammering virtually every aspect of Tesla's business. Now more than ever, it's important to only invest in Tesla if you believe in the profitability of the energy transition and that Tesla's competitive advantages will endure.There have been plenty of acronyms used to describe exciting tech companies.In 2013, Jim Cramer coined FANG for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.Then came FAANG, which was those four companies plus Apple.Next was MAMAA, which replaced Netflix with Microsoft and updated Google to Alphabet and Facebook to Meta Platforms to adjust to the name changes.In 2023, Nvidia kicked into a new growth gear, and Tesla became more accepted by the market, so the market needed a new group that included them. But now, there's talk of kicking Tesla out of the Magnificent Seven.It's important to remember that these groupings are merely a representation of what is hot in the market at a given time. For example, Netflix may not be included in the Magnificent Seven, but it quietly doubled over the past year.When FANG was created, Microsoft was a low-growth, stodgy tech company. Today, it is the most valuable company in the world and a leader in AI and cloud infrastructure.Therefore, investors must understand what's driving market sentiment in the short term and separate it from an investment thesis.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-24 10:25:56+00:00,WRAPUP 3-China told it faces 'fork in the road' as officials meet CEOs,"(Adds remarks from Apple CEO in paragraph 11)By Colleen Howe and Jing XuBEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - China needs to ""reinvent itself"" with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity, the International Monetary Fund's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday. ""China faces a fork in the road — rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,"" Georgieva said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.Officials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5% this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed ""new productive forces.""But those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centered policy mix could add $3.5 trillion to China's economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.To do that China would need to take ""decisive"" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.""A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,"" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. ""Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.""Other economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message China is open for business.Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the first two months of the year, data released Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to ""de-risk"" supply chains and operations away from China.In 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8%, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.Apple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an ""outstanding"" meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang.Cook was quoted in state-run CCTV Finance saying that Apple's Vision Pro will hit the mainland China market this year and that the company will continue to ramp up research and development investment in China.""I think China is really opening up,"" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals like aluminum and cobalt.Stephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.""Any wording and hype about an exodus in the supply chain is not what we follow,"" he said in remarks published by CGTN. ""We're invested. We're here to stay.""Over 100 overseas executives and investors were attending the China Development Forum and a series of smaller closed-door sessions with Chinese officials on Friday and Saturday.China's cabinet last week unveiled steps intended to win investment, including expanded market access and pilot programmes to encourage investment in science and technology.On Sunday, Li said China's previously announced $140-billion plan to issue ultra-long bonds would create a fund to spur investment and stabilise growth.Other officials highlighted Xi's commitment to drive investment in ""new productive forces,"" industries that officials have said includes networked electric vehicles, spaceflight and cutting-edge drug development.

2024-03-24 10:00:00+00:00,"This Is the Next ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock to Pay a Dividend (and It Could Be the Biggest of the Bunch)","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks aren't exactly know for their dividends but rather for their growth. But if a company's payout can grow by double digits for a large number of years, investing in leading tech growth stocks today could yield some impressive retirement income decades down the road.What could be even more lucrative? If you own a high-growth stock that begins to start paying a dividend after you've owned it for a number of years. When this fortunate event happens, one has probably already seen a large appreciation in the stock, so even a small nominal yield can amount to a substantial payout relative to one's initial investment.Of the three remaining Mag Seven stocks that don't pay a dividend, I'd say it's a pretty solid bet which one will be next. Not only that, but its potential payout could offer the highest yield of the group when it begins.With exception of perhaps Apple and Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet is the Magnificent Seven stock with the greatest capacity to pay a dividend -- and yet it doesn't.In 2023, Alphabet generated a massive $74 billion in net income, which is the third highest profit figure of the Mag Seven. And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet's ""other bets"" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft's $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.Looking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.CompanyNet Income (TTM)Dividend Yield Payout RatioApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)$100.9 billion0.55%14.8%Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)$82.5 billion0.71%25.2%Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)$73.8 billion0%0%Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)$39.1 billion0.40%13.4%Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)$29.8 billion0.16%1.3%Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Not only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion.To its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.But all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out.Some may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares.That being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds.Of course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.I think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones.Yet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time.Still, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments.Alphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various ""moonshot"" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.Once Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.While it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-24 09:02:00+00:00,Forget Costco: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys,"Retail is one of the best markets for long-term investment, known for its consistent growth. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. In fact, the global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.Costco (NASDAQ: COST) has enjoyed immense success, with its shares up 213% since 2019. The company's wholesale business model has won over consumers in more than a dozen countries and has an exciting outlook as it continues to expand.However, it's hard to consider Costco's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) also exist. These companies lead their respective areas of retail and hold the first and third biggest market shares in e-commerce.This chart shows that Amazon and Apple have significantly outperformed Costco's stock over the last decade, suggesting they could be better long-term buys. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple are investing heavily in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI), which could keep them on their current growth trajectories.So, forget Costco and buy these unstoppable stocks instead.One of the best reasons to invest in Amazon is its proven reliability under strain.An economic downturn in 2022 caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% during the year. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.However, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.A range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and has seen its free cash flow skyrocket 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.Amazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then.Moreover, this chart shows that Amazon's earnings could hit about $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Costco's may achieve $19 per share. On the surface, it looks like Costco is the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 43 and Costco's 47) yields stock prices of $296 for Amazon and $902 for Costco.Considering their current positions, these projections will see Amazon's stock rise 66% and Costco's 21% by fiscal 2026. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and growing prospects in AI, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer right now.Apple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. Apple's free cash flow hit $107 billion last year, significantly higher than Costco's $6 billion. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing the company to continue investing in its business.Apple has hit some roadblocks over the last year as it had to contend with reductions in consumer spending, restrictions on its products in China, and issues with Apple Watch patents. However, the company's outlook remains strong, with considerable cash reserves and expansions into lucrative sectors like AI and virtual reality.The table above shows that Apple's stock is a bargain compared to Costco's shares. Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow are considerably less than Costco's, indicating Apple is trading at a far better value.These are two helpful valuation metrics. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.As a result, Apple's stock is worth considering right now, especially over Costco.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-24 01:04:24+00:00,"Analysis-Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech","By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha MukherjeeBRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.That in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.Google has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.In 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called ""Baby Bells"" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.Regulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.The U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.Even so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.The U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.Big Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.She said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.Vestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.""If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,"" he said on Friday.BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DOIt is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.""In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,"" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Apple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.""It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,"" he said.He said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.""What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,"" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.""I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,"" he said.Apple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.Structural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.""I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,"" he said.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, additional reporting by Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Ken Li and Anna Driver)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/analysis-google-apple-breakups-agenda-010424313.html
2024-03-23 15:22:56+00:00,"UPDATE 2-China woos foreign investors in meetings with Apple CEO, global executives","(Adds more details from ministry statements)SHANGHAI, March 23 (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has met top executives of global companies including Apple Inc and SK Hynix Inc ahead of a major business conference as Beijing woos foreign investors amid geopolitical and trade tensions.In the meetings with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and other global chiefs on Friday and Saturday, Wang said China was committed to opening up its economy and offered growth opportunities for multinationals, according to ministry statements.The meetings took place ahead of the China Development Forum, which will be held in Beijing on Sunday and Monday. It is a high-level annual event where foreign business leaders can interact with senior Chinese government officials.China, grappling with a slowing economy, is stepping up efforts to attract foreign companies amid heightened Sino-U.S. tensions and Western ""de-risking"" efforts to diversify supply chains away from China.Foreign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period from a year earlier, commerce ministry data showed on Friday.Cook opened Apple's newest store in Shanghai on Thursday, as the phone maker battles falling iPhone sales in China and rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei. The smartphone maker is now facing a major antitrust action in the United States.Wang told Cook that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is a stabilising force for bilateral relations and that China was willing to work with the United States to create a ""fair, stable and predictable environment"" for businesses, the ministry said.In a separate meeting, Wang and CEO Kwak of semiconductor maker Hynix discussed supply chain cooperation between China and South Korea, the ministry said.Wang said he hoped that Hynix can continue to invest in China, and share growth opportunities from the country's huge electronics consumer market.The U.S. government has been pressing its allies including South Korea, the Netherlands and Japan to curb China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.In a meeting with BNP Paribas chairman Jean Lemierre, Wang said China hoped to resolve Sino-Europe trade disputes through dialogue and cooperation, and that the French lender could play an active role in the process.Trade disputes between China and Europe have been mounting over the past year. The European Union has launched an investigation into Chinese electric vehicle imports over state subsidies, while China has opened an anti-dumping investigation on brandy imported from the EU.Wang also held a roundtable on Saturday with executives of global drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb, GSK and Pfizer, the ministry said.

2024-03-23 08:00:00+00:00,"43.5% of Warren Buffett's $372 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks","Warren Buffett is considered one of the best investors in history. Since 1965, he has steered the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company to a mind-boggling 4,384,748% increase in value. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up just 31,223% over the same period.Buffett's investing strategy is simple. He likes companies with steady growth, strong profitability, and high-performing management teams. He's especially fond of those that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. That strict criteria is why so few technology stocks have made their way into Berkshire's portfolio.A group of companies dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" have captivated investors over the past year with their strong performance and whopping $13.5 trillion in combined valuation. The seven stocks include:Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Nvidia Microsoft Alphabet (parent company of Google)Meta PlatformsTesla Berkshire owns just two of the above names, but they account for 43.5% of the conglomerate's $372 billion publicly traded stocks and securities portfolio.Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, but it also dominates the cloud computing industry with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, and it has a fast-growing presence in both streaming and digital advertising. Berkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, and while it only accounts for a small fraction of the conglomerate's portfolio, Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying more.Investors are firmly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) right now, and Amazon is quickly becoming a leader in that field, too. As the largest cloud platform, AWS is well-positioned to distribute every layer of AI to thousands of businesses worldwide.Amazon developed its own data center chips called Trainium and Inferentia, which help set its AI infrastructure apart from many other operators who rely solely on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company also created its own large language models (LLMs) under its Titan program, which developers can use to build their own AI applications.Finally, AWS offers businesses some ready-made AI applications. They include CodeWhisperer, which helps programmers write code more quickly, and Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered virtual assistant. Businesses can feed their data into Q, at which point it can answer complex questions, create content, and help employees solve problems.Amazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023. That was more than Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla combined during their equivalent reporting periods. Yet, on a price-to-sales basis, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than all three of them.Amazon is a huge organization, so why have I focused mostly on AI? While e-commerce created most of the company's value in the early days -- and still accounts for 41% of its total revenue -- AI will likely help Amazon close that valuation gap in the future thanks to the substantial growth it could deliver.Buffett might regret not owning more Amazon stock, but Berkshire's position is worth $1.7 billion, which is still a nice chunk of change.Apple produces some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, from the iPhone to the Mac computer. Berkshire started buying Apple stock in 2016, and it has spent approximately $38 billion building its position since then. That's more money than the conglomerate has invested in any other stock except one.Thanks to Apple's strong growth, Berkshire's position is now worth a whopping $160.2 billion, representing 43% of its $372 billion portfolio.The iPhone is Apple's most successful product. It accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue, and it led to multibillion-dollar offshoot products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, with more than 2.2 billion iPhones currently active around the world, Apple is struggling to generate growth. The company's total revenue actually shrank during fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), and it grew by a modest 2.1% year over year in the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30).Apple's services segment remains a bright spot, though. It includes subscription-based platforms like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV, in addition to other services like Apple Pay. The services segment generated 11.3% in revenue growth during Q1, offsetting the flat hardware sales.Like Amazon, Apple is turning to AI to unlock its next growth phase. The latest iPhone 15 Pro is fitted with the A17 Pro chip, which is capable of efficiently processing AI workloads on-device. To utilize that computing power, Apple is developing its own LLMs and AI applications in-house, but it's reportedly in talks with leading developers like OpenAI and Alphabet, too.Advanced AI will make existing features like the Siri voice assistant far more competent and streamline tasks like writing messages and emails. Plus, a virtual chatbot might reduce the amount of time users spend trawling the internet for information.Given the iPhone's enormous installed base, whichever AI platform Apple chooses could instantly become the most widely adopted in the world. I would expect a company like Alphabet to pay billions of dollars to have Apple use its Gemini AI model, the same way it pays Apple to set Google as the default search engine on the iPhone.Buffett might have to be patient for AI to reignite Apple's growth. However, considering the company paid $3.8 billion in dividends to shareholders and spent $20.1 billion on stock buybacks in the recent quarter alone, he is being paid handsomely while he waits.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-23 02:07:08+00:00,China Loosens Cross-Border Data Rules on Business Pressure,"(Bloomberg) -- China relaxed rules governing cross-border data flows, addressing a key concern of foreign businesses that had complained previous regulations were disrupting their operations.Most Read from BloombergPutin Rejected Terror Alert Before Deadliest Attack in DecadesPutin Says Moscow Attack Suspects Detained on Way to UkraineCatherine, Princess of Wales, Says She’s Being Treated for CancerNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is UnpaidBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 EachData collected in international trade, cross-border travel, manufacturing, academic research, and marketing that don’t contain either personal information or “important” information will be exempt from security evaluations when transfered out of the country, China’s top internet regulator said in a statement Friday.While authorities have yet to detail what constitutes “important” data, the rules feature a number of carve-outs, and go far to alleviate the burden on smaller-sized companies in particular, analysts said. Larger firms will benefit from exemptions for personal data collected for human resources purposes or classified as “non-sensitive,” under rules effective immediately, the Cyberspace Administration of China said.The relaxation comes as China tries to reverse a decline in foreign investment. The statement was released on the eve of a high-profile business forum in Beijing, where attendance is expected by chief executives from foreign corporations including Apple Inc., Pfizer Inc. and FedEx Corp.“The relaxations are meaningful. This is the government’s response to foreign companies’ complaints,” said Tom Nunlist, an analyst at consultancy Trivium.Finance, DrugsThe new rules were largely in line with a draft released last year, which stated that what counts as “important” data must be specified by regulators and can otherwise be treated as non important. In theory, that will reduce uncertainty about what kinds of data can be transferred freely.“The draft promised to make compliance easier, and these regulations deliver on that. For cross-border transfers for everyday business activities, it’s business-as-usual now,” Nunlist said.While most regulatory burdens on small and medium-sized firms will be removed, large multinationals in finance, pharmaceuticals and automobile manufacturing could still face difficulties with data transfers, according to Nunlist.Sensitive data includes information which, if leaked, can be used to identify a specific person or endanger their safety, the internet regulator said.European LobbyingBeijing’s rules on data transfers, introduced in 2021, were widely seen to be more onerous than even the European Union’s strict data protection regime. International firms, from hoteliers to banks, were faced with slow approvals to transmit data beyond China’s mainland. Companies worried that mundane transfers, such as providing overseas headquarters with updates on new hires, could fall afoul of Beijing’s rules.Foreign business lobby groups have been urging Beijing to relax the rules, and EU and Chinese leaders discussed them at a summit in December.“Previously, the standards for cross-border data flow were notably vague. However, the latest regulation has effectively addressed the regulatory uncertainties surrounding specific business scenarios for better implementation,” John Dong, lawyer at Shanghai-based Joint-win Partners, said. “The crucial aspect lies in its ability to relatively alleviate concerns among both Chinese and foreign enterprises regarding cross-border data export compliance, ultimately leading to a reduction in associated compliance costs.”Organizations dealing with “critical infrastructure” or handling personal data of more than 1 million people still will need to pass security assessments in order to transfer data, the regulator said.Still, “far fewer organizations will need to apply for export security reviews,” said Rogier Creemers, a researcher on Chinese internet regulation at Leiden University in the Netherlands. This is particularly important for sectors such as aviation and e-commerce, he said.Ambiguities RemainSome ambiguities remain, according to analysts. The government has yet to fully specify what it considers as “important data” or which organizations could be counted as part of “critical infrastructure.”The new rules include carve-out for “free trade zones” within China to enforce more relaxed data transfer standards. That could allow local governments to provide more room for companies whose data is classified as important, analysts said.--With assistance from Debby Wu.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in 12th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-23 01:24:39+00:00,The DOJ's case against Apple adds to a growing pile of antitrust problems for Cupertino,"On home turf, Apple has enjoyed many years of relatively light regulatory scrutiny compared to Big Tech peers. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) opened a monopoly case against Google back in October 2020, for instance. It followed with a second antitrust case at the start of last year, targeting Google's adtech. While the FTC has been pursuing an antitrust case against Meta over a similar timeframe. And who could forget Microsoft's Windows era tango with U.S. antitrust enforcers?Thursday's DOJ antitrust suit, accusing Apple of being a monopolist in the high-end and U.S. smartphone markets, where the iPhone maker is charged with anti-competitive exclusion in relation to a slew of restrictions it applies to iOS developers and users, shows the company's honeymoon period with local law enforcers is well and truly over.But it's important to note Apple has already faced competition scrutiny and interventions in a number of other markets. More international trouble also looks to be brewing for the smartphone giant in the coming weeks and months ahead, especially as the European Union revs the engines of recently rebooted competition rules.Read on for our analysis of what's shaping up to be a tough year for Apple, with a range of antitrust activity bearing down on its mobile business.…Earlier this month, European Union enforcers hit Apple with a fine of close to $2 billion in a case linked to long-running complaints made by music streaming platform Spotify, dating back to at least 2019.The decision followed several years of investigation -- and some revisions to the EU's theory of harm. Most notably, last year the bloc dropped an earlier concern related to Apple mandating use of its in-app payment tech, to concentrate on so-called anti-steering rules.Under its revised complaint, the Commission found Apple had breached the bloc's competition laws for music streaming services on its mobile platform, iOS, by applying anti-steering provisions to these apps, meaning they were unable to inform their users of cheaper offers elsewhere.The EU framed Apple's actions in this case as harmful to consumers -- who they contend lost out on potentially cheaper and/or more innovative music services, as a result of restrictions the iPhone maker imposed on the App Store. So the case ended up not being about classically exclusionist business conduct -- but ""unfair trading conditions"" -- as the bloc applied a broader theory of consumer harm and essentially sanctioned Apple for exploiting iOS users.Announcing the decision earlier this month, EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager summed up its conclusions: ""Apple's rules ended up in harming consumers. Critical information was withheld so that consumers could not effectively use or make informed choices. Some consumers may have paid more because they were unaware that they could pay less if they subscribed outside of the app. And other consumers may not have managed at all to subscribe to their preferred music streaming provider because they simply couldn't find it.""The Commission found that Apple's rules result in withholding key information on prices and features of services from consumers. As such, they are neither necessary nor proportionate for the provision of the App Store on Apple's mobile devices. We therefore consider them to be unfair trading conditions as they were unilaterally imposed by a dominant company capable of harming consumers' interest.""The penalty the EU imposed on Apple is notable, as the lion's share of the fine was not based on direct sales -- music streaming on iOS is a pretty tiny market, relatively speaking. Rather, enforcers added what Vestager referred to as a ""lump sum"" (a full €1.8 million!) explicitly to have a deterrent effect. The level of the basic fine (i.e., calculated on revenues) was just €40 million. But she argued a penalty of few millions of euros would have amounted to a ""parking ticket"" for a company as wealthy as Apple. So the EU found a way to impose a more substantial sanction.The bloc's rules for calculating antitrust fines allow for adjustments to the basic amount, based on factors like the gravity and length of the infringement, or aggravating circumstances. EU enforcers also have leeway to impose symbolic fines in some cases.Exactly which of these rules the Commission relied upon to ratchet up the penalty on Apple isn't clear. But what is clear is the EU is sending an unequivocal message to the iPhone maker -- a deliberate shot across the bow -- that the era of relatively light touch antitrust enforcement is over.This same message is essentially what the DOJ came to tell the world this week.During a March 4 press conference on the EU Apple decision, Vestager conceded such a deterrent penalty is rare in this type of competition abuse case -- noting it's more often used in cartel cases. But, asked during a Q&A with journalists whether the sanction for user exploitation marks a policy shift for the bloc's competition enforcers, she responded by saying: ""I think we have an obligation to keep developing how we see our legal basis.""By way of example, she pointed to discussion about the need for merger reviews to factor in harm to innovation and choice — that is, not just look narrowly at impact on prices. ""If you look at our antitrust cases, I think it's also very important that we see the world as it is,"" she added, going on to acknowledge competition enforcers must ensure their actions are lawful, of course, but stressing their duty is also to be ""relevant for customers in Europe.""Vestager's remarks make it clear the EU's competition machinery is in the process of shifting modus operandi -- moving to a place where it's not afraid to make broader and more creative assessments of complaints in order to adapt to changed times. The EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) is, in one sense, a big driver here. Although the ex ante competition reform, proposed by the Commission at the end of 2020, was drafted in response to complaints that classic competition enforcements couldn't move quickly enough to prevent Big Tech abusing its market power. So the underlying impetus is -- exactly -- the problem of tipped digital markets and what to do about them. Which brings us right back to Apple.It's no accident whole sections of the DMA read as if they're explicitly targeted at the iPhone maker. Because, essentially, large portions of the regulation absolutely are. Spotify and other app developers' gripes about rent gouging app stores have clearly bent ears in Brussels and found their way into what's -- since just a few weeks -- a legally enforceable text across the EU. Hence the requirements on designated mobile gatekeepers to allow things like app sideloading; to not block alternative app stores or browsers; to deal fairly with business users; and let consumers delete default apps, among other highly specific behavioral requirements.The anti-steering restrictions Apple applied to music streaming apps were prohibited in the EU on March 4, when Vestager issued her enforcement decision on that case. But literally a few days later -- by March 8 -- Apple was banned from applying anti-steering restrictions to any iOS apps in the EU as the DMA compliance deadline expired.This is the New World order being imposed on Cupertino in Europe. And it's far more significant than any one fine (even a penalty of nearly $2 billion).The bloc has taken other actions against Apple, too. It was already investigating Apple Pay back in 2020 -- one obvious area of overlap with the DOJ case, as colleagues noted yesterday.In January, Apple offered concessions aimed at resolving EU enforcers' concerns about how it operates NFC payments and mobile wallet tech on iOS. These included proposing letting third party mobile wallet and payment service providers gain the necessary access to iOS tech to be able to offer rival payment services on Apple's mobiles free of charge (and without being forced to use its own payment and wallet tech). Apple also pledged to provide access to additional features which help make payments on iOS more seamless (such as access to its Face ID authentication method). The company also pledged to play fair in the criteria applied for granting NFC access to third parties.U.S. competition enforcers have a lot of similar concerns about Apple's behavior in this area. And it's notable that their filing makes mention of how Apple is opening up Apple Pay in Europe. (""There is no technical limitation on providing NFC access to developers seeking to offer third-party wallets,"" runs para 115 of the DOJ complaint. ""For example, Apple allows merchants to use the iPhone's NFC antenna to accept tap-to-pay payments from consumers. Apple also acknowledges it is technically feasible to enable an iPhone user to set another app (e.g. a bank's app) as the default payment app, and Apple intends to allow this functionality in Europe."")The obvious subtext here is: Why should iOS developers and users in Europe be getting something iOS developers and users in the U.S. are not?Remember that, as we dive into other regulatory action targeting Apple overseas. Because as the EU enforces its shiny new behavioral rulebook on Apple, forcing the company to unlock and (regionally) open up different aspects of its ecosystem -- from allowing non-WebKit-based browsers to letting iOS users sideload apps -- U.S. government lawyers may well find other reasons to nitpick the iPhone maker's more locked down playbook on home turf.What the bloc likes to refer to as the ""Brussels effect"", where an EU priority on law-making gives it a chance to set the global weather on regulation in strategic areas -- such as digital technologies like AI or, indeed, platform power -- could exert a growing influence on antitrust enforcements over the pond. Especially if there's increasing divergence of opportunity being made available on major tech platforms as the DMA drives greater interoperability on Big Tech, and uses data portability mandates as a flywheel for encouraging service switching and multi-homing. (The EU missed a trick on driving messaging interoperability on Apple's iMessage though, after last month deciding against designating it a DMA core platform service.)It's hardly a stretch to say the U.S. is unlikely to be happy to watch its citizens and developers getting less freedom on iPhones than people in Europe. The land of the free won't like that second class feeling one bit.EU enforcers have yet to confirm whether Apple's offer, on Apple Pay, settles their concerns. But they are now engaged in a wider review of its entire DMA compliance plan. Last fall, Apple was designated under the DMA as a so-called ""gatekeeper"" for iOS, the App Store and its Safari browser. So multiple aspects of how it operates these platforms is under review. Formal investigations may soon follow -- with some predicting DMA probes are likely, especially where criticisms persist. (And Apple appears to be the leading contender among the six designated gatekeepers for attracting claims of ""malicious compliance"" so far, followed by Meta and Google.)Key here will be what the EU makes of Apple's decision to respond to the new law by unbundling the fee structure it applies on iOS -- applying a new ""core tech"" fee, as it refers to the new charge it levies on apps that opt into its DMA-amended T&Cs (charged at €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold for apps distributed outside its App Store).If you look at the text of the DMA it does not explicitly regulate gatekeeper pricing. Nor are in-scope app store operators literally banned from charging fees. But they do need to comply with the regulation's requirement to apply FRAND terms (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) on business users.What that means for compliance in the case of Apple's bid to compensate for (forced) reductions in its usual platform take, i.e. as a result of being required to open up in ways that will enable developers to avoid its App Store fees, by devising a new fee it claims reflects the value developers get from access to its technologies remains to be seen.A coalition of Apple critics, including Spotify and Epic Games, are continuing to lobby loudly against Apple's gambit.In an open letter at the start of this month they suggested the new fee was designed to act as a deterrent, arguing it will prevent developers from even signing up to Apple's revised T&Cs (which they have to to tap into the DMA entitlements, per Apple's rule revisions). ""Apple’s new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,” they fumed.The EU is sounding sympathetic to this concern. In remarks to Reuters earlier this week, Vestager fired another shot across Apple's bows -- saying she was taking ""a keen interest"" in its new fee structure -- and in the risk that it ""will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA"", as she put it. She added that this is ""the kind of thing"" the Commission will be investigating.Behind the scenes Commission enforcers may well already be applying pressure on Apple to drop the fee. Although it's notable that -- so far -- it hasn't budged.Whereas it has made a bunch of concessions in other areas related to DMA compliance, sometimes under public EU pressure. This includes reversing a decision to block progressive web apps (PWAs) in Europe (albeit, this always looked like a counter/retaliatory move/temper-tantrum in response to DMA requirements to open up to non-WebKit browser engines); making a few criteria concessions following developer complaints; reversing a decision to terminate Epic Games' developer account; and announcing it will allow sideloading of apps in the coming weeks/months, after its initial proposal took a narrower interpretation of the law's requirements there.A cynic might suggest this is all part of Apple's game-plan for avoiding damage to its core iOS business model by tossing the enforcers a few bones in the hopes they'll be satisfied it's done enough.Certainly, it seems unlikely Apple will voluntarily abandon the new core fee. It's also unlikely the usual suspect developers will stop screaming about unfair Apple fees. So it will probably fall to the Commission to wade in, investigate and formally lay down the law in this area. That is, after all, the task the bloc has set itself.While the DOJ's complaint against Apple mainly focuses on a few distinct areas -- such as restrictions imposed on super apps, mobile cloud streaming, cross-platform messaging, payment tech and third party smartwatches -- it isn't silent on fees. In the filing it links Apple's ""shapeshifting rules and restrictions"" to an ability to ""extract higher fees"", in addition to a range of other competition-chilling effects. The DOJ also lists one of the aims of its case as ""reducing fees for developers"".If the EU ends up ordering Apple to ditch its unbundled core tech fee it could pass the baton back to U.S. antitrust enforcers to dial up their own focus on Apple's fees.The Commission could move quickly here, too. EU officials have talked in terms of DMA enforcement timescales being a matter of ""days, weeks and months"". So corrective action should not take years (but absolutely expect the inevitable legal appeals to grind through the courts at the slower cadence).On the opening of a non-compliance probe, the DMA allows up to 12 months for the market investigation, with up to six months for reporting preliminary conclusions. Within that time-frame in play -- and given the whole raison d'être of the regulation is about empowering EU enforcers to come with faster and more effective interventions -- it's possible that a draft verdict on the legality of Apple's core tech fee could be pronounced later this year, if the EU moves at pace to open an investigation.The DMA also furnishes the Commission with interim measures powers, giving enforcers the ability to act ahead of formal non-compliance findings -- if they believe there's “urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable damage for business users or end users of gatekeepers”. So, again, 2024 could deliver a lot more antitrust pain for Apple. (Reminder: Penalties for infringements of the DMA can scale up to 10% of global annual turnover or 20% for repeat offences.)Elsewhere in Europe, German competition authorities designed the iPhone maker as subject to their own domestic ex ante competition reform back in April 2023 -- a status that applies on its business in that market until at least 2028. And already, since mid 2022, the German authority has been examining Apple's requirement that third party apps obtain permission for tracking. So the Federal Cartel Office could force changes on Apple's practices there in the near term if they conclude it's harming competition.In recent years, the iPhone maker has also had to respond to antitrust restrictions in South Korea on its in-app payment commissions after the country passed a 2021 law targeting app store restrictions. Antitrust authorities in India have also been investigating Apple's practices in this area, since late 2021.Looking a little further ahead, antitrust trouble looks to be brewing for Apple in the U.K., too, where the competition watchdog have spent years scrutinizing how it operates its mobile app store -- concluding in a final report in mid 2022 that there are substantive concerns. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has since moved on to probes of Apple's restrictions on mobile web browsers and cloud gaming, which remain ongoing.Almost a year ago the U.K. government announced it would press ahead with its own, long-planned ex ante competition reform, too. This future law will mean the CMA's Digital Markets Unit will be able to proactively apply bespoke rules on tech giants with so called ""strategic market status"", rather than enforcers having to first undertake a long investigation to prove abuse.Apple is all but certain to fall in scope of the planned U.K. regime -- so regional restrictions on its business look sure to keep dialling up.The planned U.K. law may mirror elements of the EU's DMA, as the CMA has suggested it could be used to ban self preferencing, enforce interoperability and data access/functionality requirements, and set fairness mandates for business terms. But the U.K. regime is not a carbon copy of the EU approach and looks set to give domestic enforcers more leeway to tailor interventions per platform. Which means there's a prospect of an even tighter operational straightjacket being applied to Apple's U.K. business in the years ahead. And zero prospect of a let up in the workload for Apple's in-house lawyers.UK’s digital markets regulator gives flavor of rebooted rules coming for Big TechThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/22/apple-growing-antitrust-woes/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/dojs-case-against-apple-adds-182402632.html
2024-03-22 23:02:12+00:00,Apple vs US antitrust lawsuit: Everything we know so far on the DOJ's iPhone case,"Apple’s antitrust scrutiny has reached a fever pitch. The U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday that it filed a lawsuit accusing the company of behaving like a monopoly in locking in iPhone customers and limiting competitors building hardware and software. The lawsuit, which comes on the heels of significant antitrust cases against Apple outside the U.S., is a wide-ranging and complicated affair, but we’re covering the ins and outs of the DOJ’s case, the industry’s response and all the ongoing implications for companies and customers.We’ll be updating this page as the Apple antitrust case evolves, but keep in mind that there will be little settled in the short term. Experts estimate a three-to-five-year timeline for any resolution for the case.If you want to dive into legal docs immediately, you can read the DOJ’s lawsuit right here. But for the rest of us, there are five categories that the complaint identifies as areas in which Apple actively suppressed competition.“Super” apps: These are applications that contain numerous functions within a single app. This should ring a bell for anyone following Elon Musk’s “everything app” aspirations for X, and the DOJ claims Apple is inhibiting their success to increase dependence on the iPhone.Messaging apps: The blue bubble, green bubble effect is specifically cited by the DOJ as a factor discouraging iPhone users from adopting a competitor device. “This effect is particularly powerful for certain demographics, like teenagers — where the iPhone’s share is 85 percent, according to one survey,” the DOJ said in the lawsuit.Cloud streaming gaming apps: The DOJ lawsuit highlights Apple’s alleged opposition to cloud-based gaming, claiming its actions are to prevent consumers from playing games “without the need for users to purchase powerful, expensive hardware.”Digital wallets: Though the 0.15% fee Apple takes for all transactions made through Apple Pay is a fraction of the company’s total revenue, the DOJ alleges that the ubiquity of Apple Pay within its mobile ecosystem means it has “complete control” over users’ NFC payments and that it hinders competitors.Smartwatch cross-platform compatibility: This DOJ claim is straightforward. By limiting the functionality of Apple Watches with non-iPhone devices, the lawsuit claims “it becomes more costly for that user to purchase a different kind of smartphone.”Apple issued an extensive series of rebuttals to the DOJ’s claims Thursday, which you can check out in full detail right here. The core of Apple’s argument is that regulators are selectively picking metrics that make Apple’s strength in the smartphone market seem more dominant than it actually is, in their view. And in regulating the behaviors that the DOJ claims are monopolistic, Apple’s competitive advantage in the market would be diminished and iPhone customers negatively impacted in the process.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect,” Apple said in a statement provided to TechCrunchApp makers are less critical of the DOJ’s case, with the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF) voicing strong support for the DOJ’s regulatory action, which comes as no surprise given several of its members, like Epic Games and Spotify, have already had public disputes with Apple on its App Store practices.“The DOJ complaint details Apple’s long history of illegal conduct — abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition,” CAF Executive Director Rick VanMeter said in a statement Thursday. “The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple’s abusive behavior and are working to address it.”In the immediate term, not much. The release of the lawsuit, and the ensuing back-and-forth between Apple and the DOJ, was a flurry of activity that will take years to settle. The DOJ's antitrust case against Google, which was filed back in 2020, went to trial last year and could still take a couple more years to reach a conclusion.What you shouldn’t expect is for the present to play out like the past. Though the DOJ cites the successful antitrust prosecution against Microsoft in the 1990s, there are many distinctions between the two cases, mostly notably a gap between how easily defined Microsoft’s market dominance was compared to Apple’s current status quo.For more on Apple’s antitrust lawsuit, check here: Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsDOJ claims green bubbles are an issue in Apple iPhone antitrust lawsuitWhy Apple’s antitrust lawsuit could be a silver lining for Epic GamesApple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopoly Epic, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group and others applaud DOJ’s Apple lawsuitDOJ calls out Apple for breaking iMessage-on-Android solution, BeeperHere’s what the DOJ suit could mean for Apple WatchDOJ says Apple’s ‘complete control’ over tap-to-pay transactions stops innovationApple slams DOJ case as misguided attempt to turn iPhone into AndroidDOJ’s Apple antitrust case neatly aligns with EU on one key point: NFC and mobile paymentsThe DOJ’s case against Apple adds to a growing pile of antitrust problems for CupertinoThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/22/apple-vs-us-antitrust-lawsuit-everything-we-know-so-far-on-the-dojs-iphone-case/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphone-antitrust-lawsuit-everything-191839817.html

That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.A belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps. That view received a boost from the Fed earlier this week, when the central bank expressed confidence it would be able to tamp down inflation and cut interest rates this year, even as it raised its forecast for how much the U.S. economy will grow.“There is more confidence that the Fed is going to be able to ... get inflation approaching their longer-term targets without a recession,"" said Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, which is overweight the technology, financial and industrial sectors. “You are going to take a little bit more comfort that you can own a bank or an industrial if you think the Fed is going to lower rates at some point here.”Investors in the coming week will be watching Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index that will offer the latest read on inflation. The end of the first quarter also could prompt volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios.The broadening rally contrasts with last year, when uncertainty over the economic outlook prompted investors to seek shelter in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, drawn by their dominant industry positions and strong balance sheets. Only the sectors that housed megacaps - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - outperformed the S&P 500’s 24% gain last year.This year, the financial and industrial sectors are up 10.1% and 9.9%, respectively, while energy has gained 10.3%.More broadly, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year.The wider rally ""means that leadership isn't so concentrated and susceptible to a correction,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.After the Magnificent Seven all posted huge gains in 2023, performance among them has diverged more this year, giving investors another reason to look at the rest of the market.Enthusiasm over artificial intelligence has helped fuel a 90% gain in shares of Nvidia so far this year, while Microsoft has gained 14.5%. On the other side of the ledger, Apple and Tesla are down about 11% and 32%, respectively, for the year.The latest blow for Apple came this week when the Department of Justice alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, highlighting the regulatory risks that could make investors wary of Big Tech.In another sign of broadening, more S&P 500 stocks are outperforming the benchmark, 180 so far this year as of Thursday versus 150 last year.Some corners of the market, such as small caps, still look subdued. The Russell 2000, which is focused on smaller companies, is up just 2.2% year-to-date.Some investors believe the group could get a boost from the Fed’s outlook, which kept in place a previous forecast of three 25 basis-point interest rate cuts, despite the central bank’s upgraded growth projections.""As the Fed starts to lower interest rates, that creates liquidity and makes financing easier,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. ""Who's most advantaged? Not the megacap stocks that have unfettered access to capital no matter what rates are, but really the smaller, lesser-known names.""The broadening trend could take a hit if the economy begins floundering or runs too hot, upsetting the so-called Goldilocks narrative that has supported markets in recent months.Some investors also believe the market is due for a pullback after a run in which the S&P 500 has gained 27% since late October.Others, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.""The market is broadening out,"" he said. ""You're just seeing that there's more ways to make money this year than the Mag 7.""(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/broadening-us-market-rally-gets-224650088.html

2024-03-22 20:41:32+00:00,Top market takeaways after stocks rallied on Fed decision,"Markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) put a positive cap on the trading week, all three of the five-day moving averages closing Friday in the green. Stocks rallied around the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday.Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to highlight the biggest events impacting stocks, including economic and housing data prints and even the Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit levied against iPhone maker Apple (AAPL).For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.JULIE HYMAN: Let's get to Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey.JULIE HYMAN: So as we talked about, it was a Fed week. And so that has to do with how you were viewing the week as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, there was a lot of anticipation heading into this meeting, particularly when it came to those dot plots, right? Where are we going to see the Fed maintain its projection of three cuts this year? And I thought it was interesting because, Josh, you and I were talking to a friend of the show, Michael Antonelli, earlier this week. And he basically came at the notion it doesn't matter if the Fed cuts once, twice, or maybe even not at all because the economy is so strong.And I think what we got from the summary of economic projections really highlights that fact. Fed officials are penciling in that higher economic growth. They upwardly revised their revisions for GDP to 2.1%. That's up from the 1.4% the Fed officials expected back in their December projections.They also said that unemployment was going to fall to 4%. That's down from 4.1% in their projections. So it seemed like the Fed is increasingly confident that we're going to achieve this soft landing narrative.And it might not matter so much when it comes to when they cut, if they cut because the economy has just remained so incredibly resilient. You can even look at something like existing home sales, for example, that shot up 9.5% in February over the prior month, homes that are very interest-rate-sensitive area of the market. But they're doing well, the market's still tight, inventories up. Possible sign that maybe we've reached the low point there.So I think the story here is that the economy is performing well and stocks are at record highs. We're still at pretty high interest rates despite all of that. So as long as the economy remains resilient, that might lead us into that soft landing camp.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, it was interesting because we were just talking to a strategist today and the fundamentals, she was saying, I think she agreed economy is strong and that should drive corporate profits. The question is, how much are you willing to pay for that? And I think she was kind of skeptical about that multiple.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, definitely. Well, and speaking about skeptical of multiples, we were talking about the Mag Seven, the subject of the negative side of Good Buy or Goodbye today was interestingly NVIDIA. So clearly, people are looking at some of these multiples, but in particular in the Mag Seven. Apple had a tough one this week.ALEXANDRA CANAL: No good, very bad week is what I'm calling Apple. That DOJ antitrust lawsuit, I mean, wiped off billions of dollars off of the market cap. The stock closed down more than 4% on Thursday.We have bounced back off of those lows with the stock up about a half a percentage point today. But I think this underscores the potential cracks in the Mag Seven that we've been discussing and talking about, this broadening of the rally. Apple's not the only one in that camp. Tesla as well.We have heard from analysts that tech is a pretty crowded space and there could be room for a potential pullback this year. That's probably a point that you were discussing in your Good Buy or Goodbye play. And I think the fact that Microsoft has now surpassed Apple in market cap in that Mag Seven, the fact that Apple is going to continue to face these challenges.And as we head deeper into this antitrust competitive lawsuit, I do think that we could see further pullback in some of these tech names in these tech stocks. That being said though, I do think tech continues to show some resiliency. I mean, it was the only major index to close in the green today. And if you take a look at the sector action, communication services, tech, and utilities are--JULIE HYMAN: NVIDIA was at a record again today. There's one group that did not do well today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: And just briefly, athleisure which we talked a little bit about under some pressure.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and this all has to come from guidance and outlook. And what's interesting about Lululemon, it's a very high-end consumer. But the CEO on the earnings call said that they're seeing this shift in consumer behavior, which potentially signals some fatigue when it comes to demand there.And then on the Nike side, they have increased competition. So I just wonder if this could be the end of this athleisure boom that we've been seeing since COVID. Now, we're a few years removed, but these results certainly are disappointing.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/top-market-takeaways-stocks-rallied-204132038.html

2024-03-22 19:04:23+00:00,Analyst unveils Google stock price target after Apple rumors,"While Google is a search engine Goliath, the performance of the stock of its parent, Alphabet, has trailed that of its large-cap technology peers because of concern that artificial intelligence will reshape the search market.There's little debate that AI apps are changing how people consume and digest information — but there's also little to suggest that Alphabet's search dominance is over.Alphabet's market share remains intact despite the widespread availability of large language models for searching and creating content, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing.Nevertheless, the risk that AI could cut into Google's lead has led to analysts to revisit their opinions and update their stock-price targets.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesChatGPT became the fastest app to reach one million users after its launch in December 2022. Since then, everyone has been considering how AI could transform how businesses and people engage with information.Individuals are using generative AI apps to find and create more relevant insight, banks are using it to hedge risks, retailers are evaluating whether it can stop theft, and the military is studying how it may affect the battlefield.Related: Apple's AI plans reportedly could involve a partner like GoogleThe potential for AI to unlock better outcomes by intelligently crafting responses from previously siloed datasets has sparked a tidal wave of investment into training and running increasingly more robust AI solutions.Those solutions will likely affect the search market but might not derail Google's dominance.For example, despite ChatGPT and Microsoft's AI solutions, including Bing and Copilot, being readily available, Google appears to have insulated itself from these challengers via its solution, Gemini (formerly Bard).According to Similarweb, over the past six months, the market shares of ChatGPT and Microsoft search and AI chatbot have inched up 0.32% to 0.14% to 1.84% and 1.44%, respectively.Meanwhile, Google’s market share outside China has remained at nearly 92%.The ability to maintain share may stem largely from Google working quickly to launch Gemini and deploy AI tools for Google Cloud customers. These include many of the world's largest companies, which use Alphabet's servers and software to store and analyze data.Alphabet's  (GOOG)  year-over-year revenue growth over the past four quarters is 3%, 7%, 11%, and 13% and its earnings-per-share growth has changed by -11%, 17%, 42%, and 42%.The improving top-and-bottom-line growth rates suggest that Alphabet's business remains on solid ground, with ongoing advertising interest across its platform, including traditional search and YouTube, and increasing investments by Google Cloud customers to train and run their AI initiatives.Last quarter, Alphabet's $86.3 billion of revenue outpaced Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion, while its $1.64 a share of earnings beat forecasts by 4 cents.Importantly, revenue at Google's Search & Other business segment increased 12.7% year-over-year to $48 billion and YouTube ads jumped 15.6% to $9.2 billion.Of course, anything can happen, but Wedbush Securities analysts say that worry about a structural shift in search away from Google is misplaced.More AI Stocks:Analysts revamp C3.ai stock price targets after earningsAnalyst updates stock price target for Super Micro ComputerAnalysts unveil new Nvidia price targets ahead of 'AI Woodstock' conference ""We acknowledge the near-term uncertainty associated with a broader [Search Generative Experience] rollout but have increasing conviction that over the longer term SGE will provide ample monetization opportunity on par with, or potentially above, traditional Google search,"" Wedbush analysts Scott Devitt, Dan Ives, Michael Gerbino and Matthew Weiss recently wrote to institutional investors.The analysts conducted searches on PCs and mobile devices across Alphabet's AI and non-AI tools. They found that AI results with ads generally boasted a similar number of ads to non-AI search results.Currently, those ads are largely above or below the AI-generated results, but over time, Wedbush suspects that Google will increasingly allow ads to be embedded within results, improving their value to advertisers, and opening the door to more revenue opportunities.There's also a big possibility that Alphabet can produce meaningful revenue by licensing its AI to other companies, such as Apple.In March, reports surfaced that Apple was considering a deal to have Google's AI power the AI solutions within future Apple device upgrades. Given the more than two billion active iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple consumer electronics globally, an agreement could be worth big money.""We think Google remains a clear generative AI beneficiary,"" wrote Wedbush. ""Google’s core advertising business is well positioned with growth set to accelerate this year against a strong digital advertising backdrop. Google remains a dominant digital advertising business with healthy underlying growth and significant optionality related to AI across both its advertising and cloud segment.""The opportunity to overdeliver on AI versus expectations could mean that Google's stock heads higher, especially if investors start valuing the company as they have in the past. Over the past five years, Alphabet's shares have boasted an average price-to-earnings multiple of 22. Currently, it's about 19.If earnings rise thanks to cost-cutting, including layoffs during the bear market and increasing sales, investors could be rewarded with gains. As a result, Wedbush upped its stock price target to $175 from $160, adding Alphabet to its ""best ideas list.""",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/analyst-unveils-google-stock-price-190423251.html

2024-03-22 18:01:17+00:00,Explainer-US lawsuit against Apple could make iPhone experience more consumer-friendly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. has filed a lawsuit against Apple with the aim of increasing competition for the iPhone and giving a leg up to smaller companies whose apps work with the ubiquitous device.In the lawsuit against the $2.7 trillion company, the U.S. argues the iPhone maker hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices, and the Justice Department is asking the court ""to restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by Apple's unlawful conduct"".Apple said the lawsuit threatens the company and the principles that set its products apart in a competitive market.In Europe, consumers have already benefited after a slew of rules and regulations compelled Apple to make a number of user-friendly changes to its popular smartphone, suggesting similar changes could occur in the U.S. if the Justice Department lawsuit is successful.Below are several areas where EU competition authorities have changed the rules and Apple has altered its product.CHARGING CABLESApple's switch to USB-C chargers – the standard for Android-based devices – may be the most obvious change for users.In 2022, the EU passed a law making the charging port the compulsory standard across the 27-nation bloc by the end of 2024. This made it easier for consumers to power up their devices using chargers they already owned, or to borrow those belonging to others.APP STOREIn Europe, new rules have created alternatives to Apple’s App Store, meaning users can download applications from rival sources, including websites and rival app stores.This allows developers to avoid the tech giant's 30% commission fee which, in theory, could mean apps becoming cheaper. Once fully implemented, users should also enjoy access to a wider range of apps.PAYMENTS USING NON-APPLE WEBSITESIn both the EU and the U.S., app developers can direct users to their own websites to buy items, rather than having to use Apple’s in-app purchasing system, which also takes a 30% cut.The change was made in the EU in line with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act. In the U.S., Apple’s hand was forced following a lawsuit from Fortnite-maker Epic Games, a longstanding critic of the tech giant’s business practices.BROWSERSAnother change in Europe introduced to comply with the EU digital markets law concerns default web browsers. Safari has been the default browser on iPhones since the device was first released in 2007.While iPhone users could already change their default to a competitor like Google Chrome or Opera, they will now be automatically be given the choice to switch when opening Safari in the latest Apple software update, iOS 17.4.Pushing back against the EU changes, Apple said users would be presented with a list of options without the chance to learn about them, and warned it would interrupt their browsing experience.(Reporting by Martin Coulter in London and Chris Sanders in Washington, editing by Deepa Babington)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/explainer-us-lawsuit-against-apple-180117169.html
2024-03-22 17:07:28+00:00,"Apple Scraps In-House Effort to Make Watch Displays, Cuts Jobs","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is winding down a long-running project to design and develop its own smartwatch displays, putting an end to another pricey research and development initiative.Most Read from BloombergPutin Rejected Terror Alert Before Deadliest Attack in DecadesPutin Says Moscow Attack Suspects Detained on Way to UkraineCatherine, Princess of Wales, Says She’s Being Treated for CancerNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is UnpaidBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 EachIn recent weeks, the company has ceased an in-house effort to create screens with microLED technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The displays, which featured brighter and more vibrant visuals, would have been added to a future version of the Apple Watch — before potentially going into other products.But the cost and complexity of the effort ultimately proved too great. So Apple is now reorganizing the teams that handle display engineering and eliminating several dozen roles in the US and Asia, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.The move to shutter the project came around the same time as the company’s decision to cancel work on a self-driving car. In both cases, Apple is giving at least some affected employees the opportunity to find other roles within the company. If they can’t get new jobs — a likely scenario for some of them — the workers will be laid off and provided severance. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.The display project was part of a broader push by Apple to design more of its technology in-house. Though the company already customizes the displays in its products, they are heavily based on designs from partners like LG Display Co. and Samsung SDI Co. By bringing more of that process inside Apple, the company hoped to gain an edge over competitors.It also saw promise in microLED, which is made from millions of microscopic light-emitting diodes, and wanted to take a key role in developing it. The technology uses less power, reproduces colors more accurately and allows for thinner devices.The effort kicked off about seven years ago within Apple’s hardware engineering organization. It was later shifted to Wei Chen, who runs Apple’s display group. The project — codenamed T159 — was relocated to Apple’s hardware technologies division a few years ago.Apple even built its own screen manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, California, near its Cupertino headquarters, where hundreds of employees could test the production of microLED screens. Many of the job cuts involve people at that site — along with Apple display engineering centers in Asia near the company’s supply-chain hubs.Read More: Apple Is Developing Gadget Displays in Secret FacilityA visit to the Santa Clara facility this week showed that the building was still operational, with cars in the parking lot and a small number of employees entering and exiting the building.When Apple hatched the microLED plan years ago, it saw the technology as a successor to the current standard: organic LED screens, or OLEDs. It expected to eventually push microLEDs into all of its products, from Apple Watches to iPhones to Macs.In 2018, the company believed it was capable of bringing the screens to the Apple Watch as early as 2020. That timeline ended up getting delayed until 2024, and then 2025 and beyond. The situation was similar to Apple’s work on the electric car, whose release was postponed several times.For all their benefits, microLED screens were difficult to produce in sufficient quantities. Manufacturing them required cutting-edge technology and a complicated process called LED transfers — the placing of pixels in the display. Though Apple owned the design and manufacturing process for the microLED screens, it enlisted a number of partners to handle mass production and tasks like LED transfers.News of a shift in the project first emerged in recent weeks, when suppliers announced that they were losing microLED-related contracts. That included AMS-Osram AG, which said the cancellation would force it to cut jobs, potentially sell a manufacturing plant and record a writedown that could approach $1 billion.For now, Apple believes that OLED is the best current solution for its smartwatch. But it’s still eyeing microLED for other projects down the road, the people said. The company is identifying potential new suppliers and processes that could make the technology a reality in its devices, though that won’t likely happen anytime soon.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-22 16:57:44+00:00,Why Alphabet Stock Popped Again Today,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock, which started this week on a high note -- rising 4.6% Monday on news Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may license Google's Gemini for use on the iPhone -- is looking as if it may end the week on a similarly high note, up 2.1% through 11:55 a.m. ET.On Friday, investment banker Wedbush announced it's raising its price target on Alphabet stock to $175 a share, up from $160. The banker also said it's putting Alphabet stock on its ""best ideas list"" of stocks most likely to reward investors over the next 12 months, as StreetInsider.com reports today.Considering how the week began, you'll be unsurprised to learn that artificial intelligence is key to Wedbush's buy thesis. ""Alphabet ... has an unmatched breadth of data to develop and train AI models across text, images, and video, [and] a massive user base spanning Google Search, YouTube, Android, and other Google applications,"" argues Wedbush. And given these advantages going into AI battle, Wedbush simply believes that investor worries about Google coming late to the game are ""overstated.""Simply put, Alphabet will find a way to catch up to ChatGPT and other rivals -- an argument Apple's endorsement would appear to agree with.Beyond the AI argument, though, Wedbush reminds investors that Alphabet continues to dominate in what has always been its core business -- digital advertising. As Statista data confirm, Alphabet's Google remains No. 1 in this market with a 24.6% share in the U.S. and an even more dominant share of the mobile internet search activity that supports Google's ads market -- 95%.For all the hype around AI lately, it remains an open question whether companies will find AI tools valuable enough to pay for. But even if the AI bull argument falls apart, Alphabet still has a healthy core business to fall back on. With dominant market share and a stock valued at only 25 times earnings -- 12% cheaper than the S&P 500 index, by the way -- Alphabet stock looks like a buy to me.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Neuberger Berman Managing Director Dan Flax joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes this legal action will have little impact on Apple shares.Despite the regulatory scrutiny and softening demand Apple is currently grappling with, Flax suggests that the iPhone market remains ""pretty durable."" He expresses confidence in Apple's ability ""to continue executing well"" with the introduction of new products potentially buoying the stock's price into 2025 despite the current pressures.Flax acknowledges that tech companies earning heavy scrutiny over antitrust concerns is not new. Consequently, investors will have to patiently monitor how the fallout from the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple unfolds.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith- Well, speaking of Apple, what is next for the stock? It's still in focus this morning with the Justice Department's landmark antitrust lawsuit filed Thursday alleging a monopoly in the smartphone market and unfair practices tied to its App Store. Apple is also under investigation for potential violations of the European Union's Digital Markets Act and anti-competitive behavior in its App Store there. Now, Apple has denied these claims.But let's bring in our next guest Dan Flax, Neuberger Berman Managing Director to break down where the tech giant goes from here. Good to have you on the show here. So in terms of next steps here for Apple and the stock, given this regulatory overhang, what are the best and worst case scenarios from here?DANIEL FLAX: Good morning. Good to see you. I think from here, the DOJ lawsuit will remain a little bit of an overhang and of course, demand in the near term, China, general softness in the smartphone market will remain factors. But if we step back and think what's happening here, the iPhone franchise is pretty durable in my view.The install base is continuing to grow. You're seeing a continued mix shift towards higher ASP devices-- the Pro and the Pro Max. So I think that is healthy. I think you'll see the company continue to execute well on its product cycles. We'll have iPhone 16, of course, later this year. Services is healthy. You'll see new iPads get launched. And so I expect better growth later this year and into 2025, which can help the stock outperform, in my view, from current levels over the next 12 to 24 months.- Dan, regardless of the results of this investigation, antitrust lawsuit, this is something that's going to take a long time. And the question is, in the meantime, what does it mean for Apple's business as they try to expand, for example, on AI, that partnership with Google and the use of Gemini. You know, how do you think this reframes the way Apple thinks things knowing that they are now under the watch of antitrust regulators?DANIEL FLAX: Well, the platform companies, including Apple, have been heavily scrutinized. And obviously, that is going to continue in the months and years ahead. I think if we look at the smartphone market specifically, the majority of the units sold are Android. If we think about the App Store, actually the majority of the apps they are free. And in fact, Apple has paid out over $320 billion to developers since opening the App Store in 2008.And so we'll have to see how the proceedings and the lawsuit evolve in the coming months. We'll hear the arguments from Apple. From a fundamental standpoint, I think the company has to continue to innovate to execute on the product cycles. I do expect that to matter more to the share price over the next 12 to 24 months then the DOJ lawsuit.I think the key for the company is we think about services or wearables. Vision Pro, that was launched recently. That will take time. They're continuing to innovate. And I think that will matter most when thinking about growth over this short and medium term. And ultimately, it's the growth that, in my view, will contribute to share price outperformance.- Dan, even with that said, though, the question is whether that innovation needs to come from within or sort out through partnerships like a Google. And I mentioned AI specifically because there's been concern about whether, in fact, Apple is a little further behind at least in their internal development and whether because of that, they need to seek out partnerships. When you know that the DOJ is watching closely about Apple's dominance in the market, does that make it a little more difficult for Apple to keep pace on something like AI?DANIEL FLAX: What I think is interesting is, if we look at the iPhone today, and the watch, they've been infusing machine learning and artificial intelligence across the product line for some years. And I expect them to continue to do that. As we look ahead and think about generative AI, I would expect Apple to incorporate some of its own intellectual property and also to use that of partners.If we look at search as one example, Apple works with all the search providers. Google, which I think, is the strongest search provider, has the highest share in the market. And Apple works with them, it works with others as well. I think when we look ahead to generative AI, Apple is likely to work with partners, including Google. And there will be others as well.The key, in my view, it's really this integration of the hardware, the software, and the services to deliver a differentiated user experience that people get delighted with. The key is if they're able to grow the install base by harnessing both their own technology, technology from partners, and the developers who build on top of everything, that is really the magic of Apple and their broader ecosystem in my view.And their ability to nurture that is they have a strong track record. And I think we'll see more of that in the next two to three years.- And Dan, you mentioned a couple of names there, of course, including Google when you think about some of the partnerships that Apple has. Where else do you see opportunities in the tech space beyond Apple? I know some of the ones you're looking at-- Alphabet, Amazon, Cisco, and others. What makes them the standouts for you?DANIEL FLAX: What we look for is the core intellectual property and the ability to translate that into differentiated products and services that users, that customers value, and that drives growth. So if we look at Google, for example, we think they have tremendous intellectual property in terms of models, data, and really the infrastructure to drive growth from generative AI. So we see that as an opportunity.We see YouTube accelerating and we think the Google Cloud opportunity with enterprise customers remains underappreciated. Amazon, which you mentioned, we continue to like, I think, the e-commerce business, while sure there are consumer headwinds, they're executing well with more one-day delivery.Amazon Web Services should capitalize on the generative AI opportunity. And we think the advertising opportunity there is underappreciated. And I'll round it out with Motorola Solutions, the ticker is MSI, which is a leader in public safety. CEO Greg Brown and their management team have invested very thoughtfully in building out video and software capabilities.So for example, many 911 centers in the country aren't able to take in text or video. And so they are helping to modernize the infrastructure for the men and women on the front lines, the first responders, helping to keep communities safe. And so we see significant growth there as well over the next couple of years. So we see and continue to see selective opportunities in the market today.- Dan Flax, always good to get your insights there.

2024-03-22 15:55:10+00:00,Apple's Days of Smartphone Monopoly Are Coming To An End,"On Thursday, U.S. the US Justice Department, along with 17 states and districts, filed a blockbuster lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple has been accused of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market by violating federal antitrust law to stay ahead of its rivals. As a reminder, Apple ended 2023 by dethroning Samsung as the world’s biggest smartphone seller. Samsung led for 12 years, but Apple got the crown after releasing its iPhone 15 in the fall. Apple is well established as the largest smartphone maker in terms of revenue and profits, but this was the first time it led in terms of volume. The success of Huawei in China also contributed to the fall of Samsung, with the Android market being divided between Xiaomi, Google and Honor.How did Apple illegal monopolize the smartphone market?The Thursday’s lawsuit suggests that Apple used a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. It has used its control over the iPhone operation system iOS to keep innovative apps and cloud streaming services away, as well as to degrade the quality of Google-developed Android messages that are received on iPhones, along with restricting how competing smartwatches work with the iPhone and even forbid the offering of rival payment solutions.In simple words, Apple has been accused of making barriers that make it difficult to venture out outside its ecosystem.The largest antitrust complaint in a recent wave against Big Tech.Regulators are doing their best to crack the power Big Tech has been enjoying for quite a while as over the past few decades, its actions were largely unchecked. First, the European regulators kicked off the new year by forcing Apple to give other companies in the EU access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip which enables the creation of digital wallets other than Apple Pay.Now, the Justice Department is asking the court to forbid Apple to block innovative apps in its store. Also, it demands the court to make Apple remove the restrictions it imposed to prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other applications from integrating smoothly with the iPhone, just like Apple’s apps. It also asked demanded the court to disable Apple from using contractual terms to protect the monopoly it established.Apple finds the lawsuit unfair, stating that it compromises its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology with which it became one the world’s most valuable companies. Like its Big Tech peers, Apple has been shrugging off legal criticism for years. But this year’s suits from EU and US regulators challenge its very ID. Regulators are determined in making Big Tech accountable for its actions and ongoing antitrust cases against Apple and Google show things are getting more serious. What is certain is that long gone are the days of Steve Jobs’ era when Apple was a cultural phenomenon due to its relentless pursuit of earth-shattering innovation. Now, Apple is no longer several steps ahead of its rivals and instead of innovating, it is milking Jobs’ legacy while fighting for market share with its CEO focused on financial management. For now, it is financially healthy, but it is a lot more vulnerable than it used to be, with regulators and Chinese rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, biting off its power and dominance. Even Huawei is a competitive threat to Apple at the world's largest smartphone market, China. Meanwhile, Samsung is releasing models with AI features while Apple is lagging its rivals in that race, promising to add AI features this year with Bloomberg having recently reported that it is in talks with Google to power its new iPhone with the Gemini generative AI model.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

2024-03-22 15:18:39+00:00,DOJ calls Apple's privacy justifications an 'elastic shield' for financial gains,"The U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple Thursday over monopolistic practices. The complaint accuses Apple of molding its privacy and security practices in ways that benefit the company financially.One quote particularly jumps out where the DOJ calls Apple's privacy and security justification an ""elastic shield"":""Apple deploys privacy and security justifications as an elastic shield that can stretch or contract to serve Apple’s financial and business interests,"" it says.""Apple wraps itself in a cloak of privacy, security, and consumer preferences to justify its anticompetitive conduct. Indeed, it spends billions on marketing and branding to promote the self-serving premise that only Apple can safeguard consumers’ privacy and security interests.""That's not all -- there are several other instances where the DOJ thinks Apple is bending privacy to degrade customer experience.It also pointed out that Apple doesn't allow the creation and usage of alternative app stores. However, it allows governments and enterprise customers to install secure app stores, the complaint noted. It also said that at the moment developers can't offer a separate app store for children. Notably, some of this has changed partially with EU enforcing its Digital Markets Act (DMA). (Some of the changes are applicable only in the EU region.)The DOJ pointed out that Apple lets users easily sideload apps on the Mac. Developers can additionally distribute apps with fewer restrictions on the platform, the DOJ argues. The DOJ also made an argument about Apple restricting ""super apps,"" which could be a better alternative for the App Store to access services.The DOJ also accused Apple of restricting third-party apps from receiving carrier-based messages (SMS). It said that Apple marks SMS as ""private"" in its API documentation, so other developers can't access them. Apple lets users text anyone by typing their number in the ""to:"" field of its Messages app, but with other messaging apps it is not possible, the complaint reads.The plaintiff also argued that Apple makes iPhones less secure by not implementing encryption protection when iPhone users are sending messages to Android users.The complaint also accuses Apple of using ""vast amounts of personal and sensitive data"" to distribute the app on its own App Store. It also pointed fingers at the Cupertino-based company for utilizing user data for advertising.Additionally, the lawsuit said that Apple has entered into deals with Google to make the latter's service the default search engine for Safari, despite Apple knowing that there are better privacy-focused alternatives out there.The DOJ also made an argument about users having to share information with Apple to use a digital wallet rather than just sharing those details with a bank or a medical provider.Essentially, the DOJ argues that Apple's privacy and security practices are pretextual in nature and the company chooses ""alternative courses"" to protect its monopoly. Apple has long marketed user privacy as its strong suit, and DOJ's complaint wants to prove those claims wrong.Apple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopolyApple sent a boilerplate response to TechCrunch when we approached the company about the DOJ's accusation about Apple's privacy practice:At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love—designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering the government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.The company added that the DOJ discounted Apple's privacy and security features as pretextual. It argued that there is no iMessage version for other operating systems and devices because Apple can't guarantee user security on those devices.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/doj-calls-apples-privacy-justifications-an-elastic-shield-for-financial-gains/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/doj-calls-apples-privacy-justifications-061028401.html
2024-03-22 15:00:35+00:00,DOJ faces 'two critical issues' in Apple suit,"The Department of Justice has brought a lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) over alleged monopolistic practices concerning its Apple iPhone. University of Chicago Professor of Law Randy Picker joins Yahoo Finance Live to provide insights into Apple's legal battle.Picker highlights that the Department of Justice will face ""two critical challenges"" in its attempted suit against Apple: first, defining ""what's the market,"" which in this case is the smartphone market, and second, establishing what specific actions taken by Apple with its monopoly power are deemed ""problematic"" or illegal. The center of the matter will be determining what ""sharing obligations"" Apple has regarding its products.Picker draws a parallel to Europe's legislation, which has mandated changes to the iPhone, granting users choices for browsers, virtual assistants, and search engines. He notes that while the United States had considered legislation previously, it did not come to fruition. However, the professor suggests that such a legislative approach would be ""a cleaner"" solution, as a case of this magnitude could potentially take three to five years to navigate through the court system.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithSEANA SMITH: The Department of Justice alongside 16 attorneys general filing a lawsuit yesterday accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws. The DOJ saying that the tech giant is blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. This is the culmination of a five-year probe into one of the world's most valuable technology companies.For more on Apple's legal trouble and the next steps in this landmark lawsuit, we want to bring in Randy Picker, University of Chicago's law professor. Professor, it's great to have you here. Just talk to me about the nuts and bolts of this suit. How strong do you think the suit is here from the DOJ against Apple?RANDY PICKER: Look, they're going to face two critical issues. So in any antitrust case, we worry about market definition. What's the market? And this is an attempt to say that Apple has a monopoly in the smartphone market. They've got a couple of versions of that.We've seen litigation like that before. So Epic, the maker of Fortnite ran a lawsuit like that that was in a different court. They concluded then that Apple wasn't a monopolist. So that's one issue.Second issue then is assuming you find monopoly, then you only get in trouble. You're allowed in the United States to compete and win, and Apple has certainly done that. The question is, what have you done with your monopoly that's problematic, what's illegal? And what we're going to want to focus on here is the critical issue here and you talked about it a little bit is this question of how does Apple play with others? And what sharing obligations does Apple have with regard to the inside workings of the iPhone and devices like the Apple Watch?SEANA SMITH: Will we need to see new legislation passed in order to prove or in order to enact any meaningful change when it comes to Apple's App Store, when it comes to that third party app store policies just given what you just laid out and what we have seen play out in the past?RANDY PICKER: Yeah, so a couple of thoughts on that. So Europe is running this experiment right. Now so Europe passed a law called the Digital Markets Act.They've just turned that on. When you turn on an iPhone, you see choice screens for the browser, for the assistant, for search and that's all driven by recent new legislation that they're going to fight about. We considered legislation in this country.My law school classmate Amy Klobuchar, Senator Klobuchar tried to get bills through. Those did not succeed. That would clearly be a different path and in some ways other than the politics, and I'm not a politics expert, a cleaner path than what's going to be a long, hard slog, I think, in the court system.SEANA SMITH: And this wasn't exactly a surprise. Like I mentioned there in the intro, there have been talks about this. They've been looking into this going back to the Trump administration for the last five years. Talk to me just though, about the timeline process of this and how long a suit like this typically takes to work its way through the courts.RANDY PICKER: So I've been listening to your coverage. So the Microsoft case, there was an initial case against Microsoft in 1994, that one settled. Settling a case moves things so much faster.So we shouldn't be afraid of settlements. There have been some famous settlements with other tech firms in the past, AT&T. If we're going to litigate and litigate to the hilt, that's going to be three to five years probably.SEANA SMITH: So three to five years. I know it's very early and we just got this suit yesterday. But from what we know now, how do you see this ending? Do you see Apple prevailing in the end?RANDY PICKER: I want to take it in steps.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.RANDY PICKER: What happens at the district court, don't know, don't know the district court judge. So then the question is, what happens on appeal and then ultimately possibly to the Supreme Court. To answer your question, yes, I think Apple will prevail in the end.They may not prevail in the first instance. It may have to go up a level, maybe up two levels. But yes, if you're asking me for a guess, my guess is they will win.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/doj-faces-two-critical-issues-150035678.html
2024-03-22 14:48:13+00:00,Analysts say the DOJ suit against Apple will 'prove to be noise',"The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, alleging that the company has built a smartphone monopoly.Apple said in a statement that it disagrees with the premise and the suit and will fight it ""vigorously."" Deepwater Management's Gene Munster thanks that the suit will ""prove to be noise."" More than 20 years ago, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Microsoft  (MSFT) , alleging that the company — with a greater than 80% share of the personal computer operating system market — had engaged in anti-competitive practices in building up a monopoly in the computer business, and in attempting to build an internet-browsing monopoly as well.Microsoft lost the suit in 2001. Though it was not forced to break up, the Justice Department enforced several constraints on its operating system business.Now, Apple  (AAPL)  has claimed that the Department of Justice is attempting to recreate that landmark case — this time, with Apple as the defendant.Related: Justice Department sues Apple, charges 'smartphone monopoly'The Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple Thursday, alleging that the company has built up a smartphone monopoly. The case represents the government's latest challenge to Big Tech; it has antitrust suits in process against Amazon, Meta and Google parent Alphabet.Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Apple, with a greater than 70% share of the smartphone market, has engaged in ""exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct that hurts consumers and developers.""The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.Part of the complaint points to the massive App Store fees imposed by Apple on third-party developers, though Garland said that the complaint goes beyond the iPhone and the App Store, touching on issues of cross-platform messaging, among others.Apple, however, said that, contrary to the complaint's claims, it is not the same as Microsoft circa 1999; the company claimed that its share of the global smartphone market is around 20%, adding that its actions are all intended to improve the quality of its devices, not stifle competition.This may go unnoticed but it is a fundamental shift in understanding how privacy and competition interrelate which scares the bejesus out of big tech who have long tried to keep privacy and antitrust in separate lanes to use as defense arguments. pic.twitter.com/Dxwj5YmLfa— Jason Kint (@jason_kint) March 21, 2024Data from Statista, meanwhile, shows that Apple held an approximate 50% share of the smartphone market in the U.S. in recent quarters, though confirmed a share of around 20% globally.Apple refuted the complaint's claims regarding cross-platform messaging functionality, a closed App Store ecosystem, an anti-competitive smartwatch and an anti-competitive Apple Wallet.""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple said in a statement. ""If successful ... It would set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.""Related: Epic Games CEO explains how it fought Apple and wonDeepwater Management's Gene Munster said in a post that, while the case will likely ""weigh on Apple's multiples"" for the foreseeable future, it will ""prove to be noise.""""Consumers just want the best tech for the money, and Apple deliveries that today and will in three years,"" Munster said. ""Yes, Apple will likely be forced (to) make some small changes to 'delight' the regulators, but those tweaks won't change the loyalty the company has from its 1.4B and growing customer base.""His perspective is shared by Wedbush's Dan Ives, who said in a note that does not ""expect any business model changes for now,"" adding that he does not view the case as a ""thesis changer"" for the company.""Apple clearly has to find a way to eventually settle this case, pay a hefty fine and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store structure down the road,"" Ives added.Shares of Apple opened flat Friday morning, after closing down 4% Thursday.Contact Ian with tips and AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/analysts-doj-suit-against-apple-144813473.html
2024-03-22 14:48:06+00:00,DOJ is striking at the 'heart of Apple' in antitrust lawsuit,"Apple (AAPL) faces an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice alleging that the company engages in monopolistic practices in the smartphone and digital app markets. DA Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the implications of this lawsuit.Luria states that this lawsuit ""is a big deal,"" noting that while Apple has been under regulatory scrutiny before regarding the App Store, the difference this time is that it ""goes to the heart of Apple"" — its iPhone products. According to Luria, the DOJ is accusing Apple of ""a series of practices"" designed to ensure that consumers continue to buy iPhones and not switch to Android devices. However, he says that if Apple were to mitigate some of the concerns raised, it would inevitably weaken the company's position.Luria suggests that in the short term, investors have ""little reason to think"" the lawsuit will impact iPhone sales. However, in the long run, it could ""loosen their hold on"" the smartphone market in the US, impacting prices and promoting Android devices, which could pose ""a big headwind"" to the iPhone market.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithSEANA SMITH: Well, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general suing Apple claiming that the tech giant violated antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices.MERRICK GARLAND: We allege that Apple has consolidated its monopoly power. Not by making its own products better, but by making other products worse.SEANA SMITH: And that was enough to send Apple shares into the red yesterday. It sold off on the news wiped over $100 billion off from its market cap in just one day. And you can see it also lower once again, today, we want to bring in Gil Luria. He's DA Davidson's managing director. Gil, certainly we saw a lot of jitters play out in the market yesterday on the reaction to that news. How are you looking at it? How big of a deal this could potentially be for Apple's business?GIL LURIA: It is a big deal. So the difference between the regulatory scrutiny of Apple so far is that the scrutiny from the EU was about the App Store and access to the App Store. And mind you, that's an important part of Apple's business. It's the fastest growing business, the services business. But this goes to the heart of Apple, to the iPhone. The Department of Justice is coming after iPhone.They're pointing out a series of practices that Apple has engaged in in order to make sure that people continue to buy iPhone and not buy Android phones. And if Apple has to remedy all those measures, even if they're successful in mitigating some of these impacts, it will by definition weaken Apple's hold, especially in the US iPhone market. Handset market for iPhones.JARED BLIKRE: And how should investors be thinking about this, especially when it comes to the timeline because we think back to historical precedents like Microsoft that took over a decade to play out. Arguably two decades, I think it started in 1990. So we're talking about some very potentially long term play outs here. But and not necessarily pay outs, how should investors be thinking about the short term, the medium term, and the long term?GIL LURIA: I think that's right. And I think that's a good analogy. And if you think about what happened to Microsoft, it's not that the office windows monopoly was broken. It still hasn't been even 25 years later. It's that Microsoft was limited in its ability to move into the next wave. Let's not forget Microsoft missed the move to mobile entirely and then was late to cloud, and that was a much longer term impact.For Apple, also in the short term, there's little reason to think that it's going to impact iPhone sales this year. But if they do have to come back from and withdraw from some of those practices, it will over time in the medium to long term loosen their hold on the handset market, especially in the US. So iPhone prices may not be able to go up as much. It may make it more conducive for consumers to buy androids. Let's say for their kids. And if that happens over time, that is a pretty big headwind to that key iPhone market.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/doj-striking-heart-apple-antitrust-144806996.html

2024-03-22 13:45:00+00:00,History Says This 1 Unstoppable Warren Buffett Stock Is Too Expensive. Is It Still a Buy?,"If someone glanced at Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's colossal $371 billion portfolio, they'd notice something almost immediately. And that is the simple fact that a single company makes up some 43% of the entire portfolio.That stock is none other than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The consumer tech juggernaut has been a fantastic investment for the Oracle of Omaha, soaring 564% in the past eight years and crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite index.After this remarkable run, this ""Magnificent Seven"" constituent is pretty expensive. But is the stock still a buy?As of this writing, shares of Apple are selling at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.4. That's much more expensive than its historical 10-year average P/E multiple of 21.1 -- and significantly higher than the roughly 10.6 P/E ratio that Berkshire paid when it first invested in the business.Thanks to the dominant industry positions held by Magnificent Seven companies, investors might feel compelled to buy their stocks without hesitation, Apple included. But history has shown us that this is a mistake. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was the ""Nifty Fifty"" stocks. At the turn of the century, there were dot-com businesses. The thinking was that it didn't matter what valuation was paid. The companies in question were poised to continue growing rapidly, and this would reward investors, justifying the high share prices.However, this kind of thinking is flawed. At the end of the day, valuation always matters. All else being equal, it's better to buy stocks when expectations are lower and the market has somewhat soured on a business. This adds upside should the company outperform Wall Street forecasts.On the other hand, high valuations imply that the rosy projections analysts have about the future are a sure thing with a certain outcome. And this introduces downside risk if the business reports disappointing results or if investors' enthusiasm wanes.With the benefit of hindsight, paying under 11 times earnings for Apple in early 2016 looks like a no-brainer investment. Berkshire's portfolio managers identified a clear mispricing that the market was offering and took full advantage of it. In other words, the odds were stacked heavily in the conglomerate's favor, because investors were short-sighted and worried about waning iPhone demand.Over the next eight years, Apple reported solid growth thanks to strong iPhone upgrades, new product introductions, and a burgeoning services division. Plus, it returned hundreds of billions of dollars in cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Nowadays, the market fully appreciates this business and its quality.From today's perspective, paying more than 27 times earnings would probably only make sense if investors had conviction that Apple could grow its earnings per share well in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future. It takes imagination to believe this, though. And even then, it's still expensive.Apple saw its sales decline 2.8% in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). Wall Street analysts expect revenue to increase by only 1.3% in the current fiscal year. This subdued outlook doesn't justify paying the current valuation.Unless the business has plans to launch a truly game-changing offering that could move the needle, there isn't too much to be optimistic about. It was reported that management abandoned plans to develop an autonomous vehicle, which could've been just that sort of thing.Apple's current valuation doesn't reflect the company's limited growth opportunities today. I'd actually be surprised if shares outperformed the Nasdaq Composite over the next five years. As a result, it's a smart idea to pass on the stock unless there's a sizable pullback.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Apple was little changed on Friday.Read more: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake“Services has been the driver of growth for Apple, with huge margins, and there’s a question of where the business goes from here,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “I hope they can limit the damage as much as possible, because we don’t see any new growth drivers on the horizon and the stock still looks expensive. It could be dead money for a while.”The suit brought by the US Justice Department on Thursday adds a level of risk to Apple’s services business — home to the App Store and Apple Music — that is fed by the more than two billion Apple devices in use. Services revenue expanded 9% in fiscal 2023 while products revenue — iPhones, Macs and iPads — dropped 3%. Furthermore, despite only accounting for 22% of Apple’s sales, services generated more than a third of profit.The App Store is the biggest component of Apple’s services business. Analysts expect it to generate about $5.8 billion in second-quarter revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total revenue is expected to be $90.5 billion.Regulatory issues are just the latest headache for investors, who are also grappling with weak sales in China, concerns that Apple is behind peers with artificial intelligence, and few obvious catalysts for growth. Bloomberg News recently reported that Apple canceled a long-term effort to build an electric car, and its Vision Pro headset isn’t expected to be a major contributor to revenue in the near-term.Apple’s second-quarter results, scheduled for release in May, are expected to show revenue down 4.5%. That would represent the fifth quarter with negative growth of the past six. The consensus for Apple’s full-year revenue has dropped 2.1% over the past quarter.Even after recent declines, the shares trade at 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average, though a slight discount to the 26 multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index.“Shares already look expensive, and if we start to see a deterioration in important high-margin businesses like services and the App Store, then it will look even more expensive,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors. He sees an “air pocket” for the stock until it nears $155. It last closed at $171.37.This has become an increasingly common view on Apple — a notable deterioration in sentiment for what was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, compared with rates above 85% for Microsoft Corp, Nvidia Corp, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.To be sure, the antitrust suit is expected to play out over a long period of time with potential appeals. That would limit near-term impact for a company seen to have a rock-solid balance sheet and massive cash flow. But for some investors, the stock’s recent performance is alarming.“There’s still a lot of value in the brand, but it is underperforming, has weak growth, a lot of headline risk, and it’s not even cheap,” said Clark. “Honestly, why hold it?”Tech Chart of the DayAmazon.com Inc. shares are trading near the highest level since 2021 and inching closer toward an all time high.

2024-03-22 13:21:40+00:00,"Apple antitrust suit mirrors strategy that beat Microsoft, but tech industry has changed","By Mike Scarcella(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition.The market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said.The Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.Apple said the government is wrong on the facts and law.The government has to prove that Apple’s business practices were “exclusionary” and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts.The government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called ""super apps,"" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.One example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone — the dreaded ""green bubble"" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system.Antitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services.By comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company’s operating system.That might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences.Apple can contract with whom it wants and design products as it sees fit, legal experts said.It becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington’s law school.“The fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,"" Ross said. ""That has antitrust law backwards.""MARKET SHAREMicrosoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google's Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm.The Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market.Apple and rival Samsung Electronics each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed.Microsoft ""clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,"" Ross said. On the other hand, Android “is very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.”Ross predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case.Some of these allegations have been touched upon before in court.In 2021, in an antitrust case brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were ""locked-in"" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices.Of course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case.Legal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases.“They are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,” said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple.Litigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market.""If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,"" Maxman said. ""That's exactly what was said in Microsoft — and guess what, it was true.""(This story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 11)(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Tom Hals and Jamie Freed)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/analysis-apple-antitrust-suit-mirrors-100156140.html
2024-03-22 13:03:12+00:00,"Microsoft Deal, Apple-Google Talks Show Tech Giants Need AI Help","(Bloomberg) -- Earlier this week, Microsoft Corp. named artificial intelligence pioneer Mustafa Suleyman chief of its consumer AI business and hired most of the staff from his Inflection AI startup. A day before, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet Inc.’s Google was in talks to license its Gemini AI engine to Apple Inc.Most Read from BloombergPutin Rejected Terror Alert Before Deadliest Attack in DecadesPutin Says Moscow Attack Suspects Detained on Way to UkraineCatherine, Princess of Wales, Says She’s Being Treated for CancerNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is UnpaidBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 EachThe moves suggest that despite pouring billions of dollars into partnerships, investments and product development, Microsoft and Google are struggling to figure out how to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. Neither company is moving fast enough to field consumer products that generate revenue and grab market share, and, despite their size and power, they remain vulnerable to being disrupted.Even as engineers labor to perfect the large language models undergirding the technology, the companies are forming alliances and scouring the world for talent and promising startups.Forging a leading position in generative AI requires each of the tech giants to assemble various ingredients—computing power, top-of-the-line AI models, trustworthy and easy-to-use products and ways of getting them to people. None of the tech giants has all of the ingredients. Google, once the pioneer in large language models, keeps releasing products with worrying errors and biases. Microsoft got a head start with exclusive access to many of OpenAI’s ground-breaking models, but has never been skilled at building exciting consumer products besides video games.Apple is years behind in artificial intelligence and, to shore up its capabilities in China, the company is in exploratory talks with Baidu Inc. about using the Chinese company’s AI technology in devices sold there, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. On the plus side, Apple sells the world’s most popular smartphone, and its App Store serves as a distribution platform for millions of apps. The company plans to announce an AI comeback strategy in June.“Even large tech companies and cloud providers, with their vast resources, cannot innovate the entire generative AI ecosystem single handedly,” said Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. “Companies must constantly be on the lookout for the best talent and technology to fill gaps in their portfolios.”Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella isn’t satisfied with his team’s efforts to create consumer products, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Over the past year, the company has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products—creating various digital assistants under the new Copilot brand. Yet Bing has made few gains against search market leader Google, and the other products are works in progress. Though OpenAI has given Microsoft a first mover advantage, the startup is focused on the underlying technology not developing products for the software giant.That’s why Nadella recruited Suleyman to be executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, along with Inflection AI co-founder Karén Simonyan, who will become chief scientist of the new unit. Nadella wanted someone to unify and oversee product development and believes he found that person in Suleyman, with whom he bonded during conversations about how AI could be tailored to individual users.“Really all we’re trying to do is craft a true end-to-end product experience, so the user feels that there is a seamless, fluid, human-like conversational interaction,” Suleyman said in an interview Monday. He likened the work to sculpting and said “that art requires you to know the real sweet spot of when a piece of technology is ready and how to dress the experience so that it has an essence and a character which is familiar and accessible and trusted.”Nadella also knows that because AI will completely transform the industry, even Microsoft’s flagship products aren’t immune to disruption—whether by a peer like Google or a startup that hasn’t even been invented yet. “These businesses are big and they’re all going to get re-litigated, right?” Nadella said in an interview. “So even the incumbents can’t take it for granted.”Nadella’s faith in Suleyman isn’t universally shared. During his time at Google’s DeepMind, Suleyman wasn’t focused on consumer products. At Inflection AI, he oversaw the development of a chatbot called Pi that was designed to interact with users in a more human and supportive fashion. But despite attracting a million active daily users, the startup never found a business case. Suleyman was also accused of treating DeepMind employees poorly. He has acknowledged making mistakes and says he learned from the experience. Still, it’s unclear how well he’ll mesh with Microsoft’s existing team.The proposed partnership between Google and Apple is still being worked out so there are few details of how exactly it would work. But assuming the deal comes to fruition, it could help each company with their AI efforts.Since early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model codenamed Ajax, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees also have been trying out a basic chatbot dubbed Apple GPT. But Apple’s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option. Apple could ultimately team up with another company, including OpenAI, or several.Google has raced to weave AI into its products, but the company has been dogged by concerns that it’s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft. Last month, the company pulled an image generator amid a flurry of criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. A deal with Apple would be Google’s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date and could be a major boon for the company’s AI efforts. Apple has more than 2 billion devices in active use that could potentially become home to Google Gemini later this year.Pushing Google’s AI tools to as many devices as possible could help make them the ones users turn to reflexively, as they do with the company’s search engine, creating a virtuous cycle whereby the programs become sharper and sharper with additional user data. Earlier this year, Google struck a deal with Samsung Electronics Co. to incorporate its Gemini technology into the South Korean company’s phones, offering a glimpse of how Google could leverage its relationships with Android device manufacturers in the age of generative AI.Industry observers expect tech companies to continue collaborating and investing in startups to augment their services and avoid being disrupted. “They need each other, especially in a space like AI which requires engineering expertise and lots of computing power,” said Dan Wang, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship. “It’s a sensible way for the large tech companies to spread out the risk.” No one, he added, “has really found a killer application just yet that people are willing to pay for.”--With assistance from Mark Bergen, Mark Gurman and Julia Love.(Updates with report that Apple is in talks to use Baidu’s AI technology.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-22 12:15:36+00:00,Apple customers love Apple. The Biden administration thinks they could do better,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Apple wants to break the company’s notoriously tight grip on the iPhone, the device that’s made it one of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet.But regardless of what happens in court, the case is already shining a light on the two faces of Apple: the cool, high-end tech brand that customers adore; and the ruthless, unavoidable behemoth that developers loathe.Here’s the deal: The Feds say Apple is maintaining a monopoly that stifles competition, deprives consumers of choice and ultimately forces them to pay more.Apple’s response to the allegations is, more or less, a) no we don’t, and b) good luck proving customer harm when everybody loves us.And that’s where this Goliath versus Goliath battle gets interesting.Customers really like Apple. We love the phones, the watches, the laptops and the AirPods that ensure we never have to be alone with our thoughts (unless, heaven help you, you forgot to charge them). Heck, I’m typing this article on an Apple keyboard connected to a MacBook connected to iCloud, and I would throw a fit if I had to switch to a PC.Apple even nodded to this in its widely circulated statement to the media Thursday:“We innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.”Magical! The company added: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”And it’s true — the gods saw fit to get Steve Jobs and Jony Ive (the revered product designer behind Apple’s biggest hits) in the same room at the same time, and the world was never the same.Their products married good design and good software. They were never cheap, but they were shiny, user-friendly, simply beautiful. With help from the best marketing team in Silicon Valley history, Apple became a tech icon with a billion devotees.But on the business side, Apple is not so beloved.The company has a reputation for quashing competition and squeezing developers with exorbitant fees. Many smaller tech companies hate Apple as much as they live in fear of its lawyers.“Apple has this practice of seeing what others innovate for the phone, copying it, and then making it so that those others can’t compete,” Adam Wolfson, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Quinn Emanuel, told me. (There’s even an industry term for when Apple appropriates a third party’s tech, called “Sherlocking” — a nod to one of Apple’s search products that rendered its non-Apple rival, Watson, redundant.)“They very much have an approach to being about as sharp-elbowed as you can possibly get,” said Wolfson, who has represented clients in Apple disputes. “Apple is extraordinarily litigious, and will fight to the very last breath, because it can.”The DOJ lawsuit argues Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by blocking innovative new apps and services.If you’re an iPhone user and you’ve ever been in a text thread with someone using an Android device, you know the green-bubble problem and how annoying it is. It’s not as if Apple can’t make that experience better, according to the DOJ — it just doesn’t want to, because it’s better for Apple if its users see Android as a social faux pas. It’s tech tribalism, and Apple is a master at cultivating loyalty.The green bubble issue is just one of several ways Apple is abusing its dominant position, according to the lawsuit. (My colleague David Goldman has more on that here.)If it succeeds, the Justice Department could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach, which Apple says is meant to create a seamless experience for users and keep them relatively safe from viruses.That is a concern for investors, says Gene Muster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, because the lawsuit goes after “the juiciest part of their business.”But Muster doesn’t expect the lawsuit to be a body blow for the company, and believes “people will still gravitate to Apple products.”Indeed, customer satisfaction is, paradoxically, a tricky issue for the DOJ as well. People are pretty content with their iPhones. Could we be more content with more competition? Maybe. The DOJ will have their work cut out for them trying to prove it.Ultimately, Wolfson said, “the law wants to make sure that consumers are getting the absolute best, not just what Apple decides we want.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-customers-love-apple-biden-121536867.html
2024-03-22 12:09:16+00:00,Apple's antitrust suit is a silver lining for Epic Games,"The Department of Justice and 17 state attorneys general filed a massive lawsuit against Apple on Thursday morning, accusing the company of monopolistic smartphone practices. Meanwhile, Fortnite maker Epic Games has been accusing Apple’s iOS App Store of antitrust violations for years in an ongoing, arduous legal battle.Epic is never named explicitly in the 88-page lawsuit, but the gaming company’s complaints are echoed across extensive discussion of the App Store’s anticompetitive practices.“Apple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily,” the suit says. “And it frequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple’s monopoly power.”Epic’s core complaint about the App Store is that developers must cede 30% of in-app purchases to Apple. And unlike Android devices, iPhones do not allow for sideloading apps, meaning that Apple has control over any app in its App Store. For almost a decade, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been a staunch critic of the revenue cut, which he thinks is monopolistic and predatory toward smaller companies. In 2020, Epic made it possible for Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, rather than giving a cut to Apple — then, Apple removed Epic from the App Store, and now, four years later, we’re still watching the two companies duke it out in various legal proceedings.While a judge ruled at the time that Apple can’t prevent apps from routing users to alternative payment methods, the iPhone maker was ultimately not deemed a monopoly.Given past rulings in Apple’s favor, it’s surprising that this lawsuit is aligned with some of Epic’s grievances.“While Apple has reduced the tax it collects from a subset of developers, Apple still extracts 30 percent from many app makers,” the suit says. “Apple also generates substantial and increasing revenue by charging developers to help users find their apps in the App Store—something that, for years, Apple told developers was part of the reason they paid a 30 percent tax in the first place.”Epic isn’t the only large company that has faced off against Apple. In January, as developers prepared for the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) to take effect, Spotify also stepped into the ring, calling Apple’s compliance plan “extortion” and a “complete and total farce.” Then in March, Apple was fined €1.84 billion for breaching antitrust rules in the market for music streaming services.On Thursday, the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF) — which includes Epic Games, Spotify, Deezer, Proton and other companies — released a statement in favor of the DOJ’s action against Apple.""With today's announcement, the Department of Justice is taking a strong stand against Apple’s stranglehold over the mobile app ecosystem, which stifles competition and hurts American consumers and developers alike,” said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the CAF. ""The DOJ complaint details Apple’s long history of illegal conduct — abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition. The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple’s abusive behavior and are working to address it.""Epic Games declined TechCrunch’s request to comment. Sweeney, who is usually vocal about these issues, has also been reticent on the matter.“I’ll be off Twitter antitrust commentary between now and the end of my testimony in the Australian Epic v Apple and Google trial in Melbourne,” Sweeney posted, alongside a photo he took in Melbourne.Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsFor more on Apple’s antitrust lawsuit, check here:Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsDOJ claims green bubbles are an issue in Apple iPhone antitrust lawsuitApple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopoly Epic, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group and others applaud DOJ’s Apple lawsuitThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-antitrust-epic-games/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-antitrust-suit-silver-lining-170611780.html
2024-03-22 11:47:02+00:00,More stocks are joining the gangbusters rally. That’s good news for investors,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.The dwindling ranks of the Magnificent Seven are finally getting reinforcements.The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes notched record highs on Wednesday and Thursday after the Federal Reserve reiterated its forecast for three quarter-point rate cuts in 2024. Investors had worried that the central bank would adjust its expectations to fewer than three cuts following a slate of hot inflation data in recent months.But more stocks than just Big Tech have paved the way higher. The S&P 600 index, which tracks American small-cap stocks, just turned positive for the year. That’s good news for Wall Street, because smaller companies generate most of their revenue from US customers, making them bellwethers of the US economy. Small caps are often active in sectors like financials and industrials that tend to rise and fall with wider economic activity.“When you see small-cap industrials leading, that’s usually a sign that the market is saying things are on pretty firm footing here,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.Their participation also shows that the market’s surge is extending beyond tech giants. That’s a welcome sign for investors, since a broader rally begets a healthier rally. When the market’s gains don’t depend on just a handful of names, they’re less vulnerable to pullbacks.The rally had already begun broadening in recent weeks, before the Fed-induced euphoria. Some investors say that’s because corporate earnings beats coupled with strong economic data have renewed hopes for a soft landing, or a scenario in which the Fed brings inflation down to its 2% target without triggering a recession.About 93% of S&P 500 companies have posted fourth-quarter results, and 78% have beat earnings expectations, according to Ned Davis Research data through March 19.“Recession” was mentioned in 47 fourth-quarter earnings calls of S&P 500 companies, the lowest count since 2021, according to FactSet data through March 7. In contrast, “soft landing” was cited on 37 earnings calls, the highest number of companies mentioning the term going back at least three years.Meanwhile, jobs data in recent months shows that the labor market is staying resilient against interest rates hovering at a 23-year high.That has led stocks to continue soaring after last year’s powerful rally, even though shares of Tesla and Apple have fallen, while Alphabet has lagged the double-digit percentage gains notched by Magnificent Seven peers Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta.Still, Detrick says that a 5% to 7% selloff wouldn’t be worrisome: “Just enough to shake out those johnny-come-lately weak hands … because [the rally is] almost too easy,” he said.Wall Street could also be getting too ahead of itself by expecting such a rosy outcome for the economy, some investors say.“It’s going to be important for investors to ascertain what expectations that have been embedded are realistic and which expectations are a little bit too optimistic,” said Jeffrey Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments.The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market, report my colleagues Brian Fung, Hannah Rabinowitz and Evan Perez.It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling — and in some cases, restricting — how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower the government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.Read more here.The Swiss National Bank surprised markets Thursday by cutting interest rates, becoming the first of the world’s major central banks to do so since they began battling a post-pandemic surge in prices.The SNB announced that it would reduce the cost of borrowing by a quarter of a percentage point as it revised down its forecasts for inflation this year and next, reports my colleague Anna Cooban. “The fight against inflation over the past two and a half years has been effective,” it said in a statement.Pressure is also building for the European Central Bank to cut rates for the 20 countries that use the euro. Data released Thursday suggested the region’s economy went backward in March, bolstering the case for the ECB to break with tradition and reduce rates before the US Federal Reserve.The Purchasing Managers’ Index showed a slight increase to 49.9 in March, driven by expansion in the services sector, but remained below the 50 mark that separates contraction from growth.Europe’s manufacturers have spent the best part of the past two years grappling with steep energy costs, which surged after Russia invaded Ukraine. Manufacturing remains mired in a deep contraction, according to the latest PMI numbers.Read more here.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/more-stocks-joining-gangbusters-rally-114702637.html
2024-03-22 11:46:44+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Tech stocks are known more for their significant long-term growth than for their dividends. However, investing in a tech company with a reliable dividend can be an excellent way to expand your portfolio, benefiting from a high-growth industry and potential dividend reinvestment.Five of the six most valuable companies in the world are tech firms. The industry generates massive amounts of cash, allowing some larger firms to reward investors with more than just stock growth.While these companies' dividend yields might not compare to some non-tech stocks, they are worth considering along with their stellar share-price appreciation. So here are three dividend-paying tech stocks to buy right now.Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for AI developers worldwide. The company became the first chipmaker to hit a market cap above $1 trillion, with its stock rising 249% in the last year.The company paid its first dividend in 2013 and increased it every year until November 2018. Its dividend remained at $0.16 until May 2021. A 4-for-1 stock split the same year brought its quarterly dividend proportionally down to $0.04 per share for a 0.02% yield, where it currently stands.However, it remains an attractive dividend-paying tech stock. When companies like Amazon and Alphabet have no dividends, Nvidia's impressive stock growth, alongside even a small dividend, makes its stock worth buying.Nvidia's quarterly revenue climbed 207% over the last year, while operating income has soared 536%. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that will likely see it raise its dividend in the coming years.Data by YChartsMoreover, this chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,294, projecting stock growth of 44% over the next two fiscal years.Along with a reliable dividend, Nvidia's stock looks like a no-brainer investment right now.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, which translates to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).Consistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model. Potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox made the company a tech behemoth.The success of these products has seen Microsoft's annual revenue rise 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion last year.Along with solid financials, there are plenty of reasons to believe Microsoft will continue increasing its dividend. It pays out only about 25% of its earnings in dividends, indicating it could keep growing its dividend even if headwinds arise.Moreover, the company is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term.A forward P/E ratio of 36 makes its stock somewhat expensive. However, a dominating role in tech and consistent dividend growth means its stock has likely earned its high valuation and is worth considering right now.Rather than focusing exclusively on high yields, one of the best ways to find dividend stocks is to seek out companies with significant cash resources, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). A focus on high yields could lead you to an investment in a financially struggling business; meanwhile, a cash cow like Apple can almost guarantee dividend growth over the long term.In the last decade, its dividend yield has increased 104%. It rose to $0.24 per quarter in 2023, with a yield of 0.5%. Apple has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years, with its payout requiring only about 15% of its earnings.Apple's yield might not be as impressive as popular dividend stocks like Verizon or Coca-Cola, but sticking with its current dividend growth trajectory could see the payouts double again over the next 10 years. With a stock that has risen 840% since 2014, the company could be one of the smartest long-term investments. And it's hard to argue with Apple's powerful position in tech. The company hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year thanks to the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and iPad, as well as its many digital services.The company's forward P/E of 27 makes it slightly cheaper than Microsoft but still pricey. However, a reliable dividend and expansions into lucrative markets like AI and virtual reality make its stock a solid buy this March.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-22 09:25:00+00:00,"Meet the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Is Selling","The Magnificent Seven is a group of megacap companies collectively worth about $13 trillion. They account for roughly one-quarter of the S&P 500 and more than one-tenth of all publicly traded stocks by market capitalization.AlphabetAmazonApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Meta PlatformsMicrosoftNvidiaTeslaBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) owns just one Magnificent Seven stock. Under Warren Buffett's leadership, the company began buying Apple in the first quarter of 2016, and the stock has since become its largest holding. But Berkshire sold about 10 million shares of Apple in the fourth quarter, and Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein recently said he wouldn't be surprised to see the selling continue in 2024.Here's what investors should know.Berkshire has only trimmed its position in Apple on six occasions since it began accumulating shares. The first sale took place in the fourth quarter of 2018. The next sales took place in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, followed by the third and fourth quarters of 2020. And the latest sale occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023.That does not necessarily mean Warren Buffett has lost confidence in Apple. In fact, just last year he said Apple was a ""better business"" than any company Berkshire owned. I doubt his opinion is much different today. Despite the recent sale, Berkshire still had 43% of its $372 billion stock portfolio in Apple at the end of the fourth quarter. That signals high conviction.Of course, as Jordan Klein at Mizuho suggested, Berkshire may have continued selling shares after the quarter ended. After all, many investors are worried about weak iPhone sales in China and the recent implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe. For context, the DMA stipulates that digital platform operators must allow third-party app stores and alternative payment options on their devices, meaning it could hurt Apple's revenue.As to whether Berkshire continued selling the stock, investors will have an answer no later than May 15. That is the date by which Berkshire must disclose first-quarter trading activities in a Form 13F filed with the SEC. In the meantime, investors should ask themselves if Apple is a worthwhile investment at its current price.Apple has an important advantage in brand authority, which itself is a product of engineering prowess. The company pairs appealing hardware with proprietary software to create a unique user experience that consumers find valuable, and that experience becomes increasingly compelling with more devices. Apple derives tremendous pricing power from that strategy. For instance, the average iPhone sold for three times more than the average Android smartphone last year, according to eMarketer.Brand authority has helped Apple secure a strong presence in several consumer electronics verticals. Most notably, the company led the global smartphone market in shipments last year, but it also ranked first in tablet and smartwatch shipments, and fourth in personal computer shipments. Of course, consumers purchase hardware intermittently, so Apple has developed an ecosystem of adjacent services to more effectively monetize its installed base, which recently surpassed 2.2 billion devices.With that in mind, Apple reported lackluster financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 31, 2023. Revenue climbed 2% to $119.5 billion as solid momentum in services was offset by declining sales in the iPad and Wearables categories. Sales growth in the services segment was primarily driven by strength in advertising, streaming video, and cloud storage. Meanwhile, gross margin expanded 290 basis points and GAAP earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per diluted share due to share buybacks and the growing importance of the high-margin services business.The chart below provides more detail on first-quarter revenue growth across the five product categories.One potential problem not shown in the chart is that China sales fell 13% in the December quarter due to stiff competition. Worse yet, Counterpoint Research says that trend intensified during the first six weeks of 2024, with iPhone sales slipping 24% in China. Meanwhile, Huawei's sales surged 64%.On the December earnings call, CEO Tim Cook told analysts he remains ""very optimistic about China over the long term."" But investors should monitor the situation. China accounts for about 17% of Apple's revenue, and the company is losing market share in the region.Going forward, Grand View Research expects the consumer electronics market to grow at 6% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, mobile application sales are forecasted to increase at 14% annually, mobile wallet revenue is projected to grow at 28% annually, and digital ad spending is expected to compound at 15% annually during the same period.I mention those last three markets because they represent particularly important opportunities for Apple. The App Store accounts for about one-third of services revenue, according to The Wall Street Journal. Apple also ranks among the fastest-growing digital advertising companies in the U.S., and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers.With that in mind, Wall Street expects Apple to grow sales at 5.8% annually over the next five years, while earnings per share increase at 8.3% annually during the same period. Stronger bottom-line growth is based on two assumptions: (1) Services will continue to account for a greater portion of total revenue, and (2) Apple will continue to repurchase stock.Even so, the current valuation of 27.4 times earnings looks expensive compared to Wall Street's consensus estimate. Additionally, flagging iPhone sales in China and the possibility that the DMA could hurt App Store sales in Europe introduce more uncertainty. For those reasons, I would personally avoid this stock right now, and I would consider trimming my position if I were a shareholder.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-22 09:11:36+00:00,Apple CEO Tim Cook is on a charm offensive in China as the U.S. puts the squeeze on the iPhone maker,"On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it was filing an antitrust lawsuit on Apple, the maker of the iPhone. But as that news broke, CEO Tim Cook was on the other side of the world. The Apple chief executive is in China, one of the company's most important overseas markets where the iPhone maker faces both stiff competition and regulatory scrutiny.Cook is in China ahead of the China Development Forum, Beijing's big CEO summit featuring global executives. Cook is reportedly attending the forum.The Apple CEO, a frequent visitor to China, seems to be on a charm offensive. There's ""no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,"" Cook said on Wednesday in an interview with the media at Shanghai. China is a key manufacturing hub for Apple products, with suppliers like Foxconn operating massive iPhone assembly plants in Chinese cities like Zhengzhou.Then, on Thursday, Cook helped open a new Apple story in Shanghai. The retail outlet, Apple's 47th in mainland China, is the largest in the country and the second-largest globally, after Apple's Fifth Avenue location in New York City.Last week, Apple announced that it will expand its operations in Shanghai and Shenzhen to strengthen testing and research capabilities for products like the iPad, iPhone and Vision Pro.Cook is in China as Apple's sales in the country come under pressure.Apple reported $20.8 billion in China sales for the three months ending Dec. 31, 2023, 17% of its total quarterly revenue. Yet the figure represents a 13% year-on-year decline.The company's sales in China for the first six weeks of 2024 are down 24% year-on-year, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Apple's loss has been Huawei's gain: The latter's new Mate 60 Pro smartphone, with a locally-made advanced processor, helped boost the Chinese tech company's sales by 64% in the first six weeks of the year.A slowing Chinese economy could also be pushing more cautious consumers away from Apple's premium products. Overall smartphone sales in China fell 7% on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 according to Counterpoint’s data.Apple is also reportedly trying to move some of its production outside China. Apple suppliers like Foxconn and Luxshare are setting up facilities in Vietnam and India.Last year Beijing reportedly ordered employees at government department and state-owned enterprises to stop using Apple products.Apple is facing challenges on all fronts. European officials are scrutinizing Apple's rules for its app store, under the region's new Digital Markets Act.On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice and 16 states filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and limiting consumer choice. In particular, U.S. officials accused Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its devices, and of abusing its control of the app store to make it harder for consumers to switch phones.An Apple spokesperson told The Verge that the lawsuit sets ""a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.""Apple shares fell 4.1% in Thursday trading, following the announcement of the lawsuit.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-charm-091136460.html
2024-03-22 09:06:00+00:00,44% of Warren Buffett's $366 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Widely Owned Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,"For the better part of six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a show for Wall Street and the investing community. Despite being fallible just like every other investor, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" as he's affably known, has overseen a monstrous aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 4,995,105%, as of the closing bell on March 15.Extensive books have been written detailing the ""recipe"" Buffett has used to vastly outperform the benchmark S&P 500. Typically, this means seeking out brand-name businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams.But you might be surprised to learn that three of the 45 stocks Buffett and his investment team are currently holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $366 billion portfolio are cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. According to estimates from PwC, AI solutions -- i.e., software and systems handling tasks that would normally be assigned to humans -- can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by the end of the decade.As of March 15, 44% ($159 billion) of the $366 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was being put to work in three widely owned AI stocks -- and no, Nvidia isn't one of them.The lion's share of Buffett's ""AI holdings"" can be traced to the largest position in Berkshire's investment portfolio: tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple accounts for more than 4 times the weighting of Bank America, which is Berkshire's second-largest holding (10% of invested assets).Although Apple isn't developing the infrastructure that's made Nvidia the foundation of the AI movement, AI solutions are embedded in virtually all of its products and are critical to the company's long-term growth strategy. Apple uses AI to improve the autocorrect and word suggestion capabilities of its U.S. market-share-leading iPhone, and recently launched its mixed-reality Vision Pro headset, which incorporates eye- and hand-tracking using AI.While artificial intelligence solutions are staples in Apple's products, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, undoubtedly purchased shares of Apple for different reasons.One of the primary lures of Apple is its exceptional customer loyalty. It's one of the most well-known and valuable global brands. Sustaining a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market means consumers eagerly await the annual launch of a new iPhone.The Oracle of Omaha is likely also enamored with Apple's top-notch management team. In addition to constantly improving the functionality of iPhone and developing the Apple Watch, Apple CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a transformation that's seen his company become more services oriented. Emphasizing subscription services should steadily improve Apple's margins, smooth out the sales fluctuations observed during the tail end of major iPhone upgrade cycles, and encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services.The other reason Buffett is a big fan of Apple is the company's unmatched capital-return program. Apple returned just a hair over $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders last year, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $651 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. This means Berkshire is steadily becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to lift a finger.A second artificial intelligence stock you'll find nestled in Warren Buffett's $366 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).Amazon is utilizing AI in more ways than can be counted here. Some examples include analyzing what you're purchasing and putting in your shopping cart to recommend new products, as well as allowing its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to build applications using generative AI to tailor advertisements and improve customer interactions.Additionally, Amazon is developing its own graphics processing units (GPUs) for its in-house data centers that could complement, or even replace, the GPUs from Nvidia that have taken the AI movement by storm.While most people are familiar with Amazon because of its overwhelmingly dominant online marketplace, it's actually the company's ancillary operating segments that do a majority of the heavy lifting. Arguably no segment is more important than AWS.Last year, AWS accounted for about a sixth of Amazon's net sales, but was responsible for two-thirds of the company's operating income. Enterprise cloud spending still appears to be in its relatively early innings of expansion, which suggests AWS has many years of double-digit sales growth ahead. As of September 2023, AWS led all other cloud infrastructure service platforms with a 31% share of global spend.Interestingly enough, Amazon is fairly inexpensive, too. Shares can be scooped up right now for a greater than 40% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period. While this may not be the traditional ""value stock"" Buffett looks for, it's certainly something that has piqued the interest of one or both of his top investment aides.The third AI stock that, collectively with Apple and Amazon, accounts for approximately 44% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW). This is another Berkshire holding that was almost certainly added because of the influence of Weschler or Combs.Snowflake really put itself on the map of AI investors this past summer when it announced a collaboration with Nvidia that would allow Snowflake accounts to utilize Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. Snowflake is also making generative AI solutions available to its customers to assist with training, customizing, and deploying large language models.What's really drawn investors to Snowflake since it went public in September 2020 is its well defined competitive advantages. For instance, it can be challenging for users of competing cloud infrastructure service platforms to share information. Since Snowflake built its infrastructure atop the most popular cloud platforms, sharing and transferring data is seamless.Customers also seem to appreciate Snowflake's transparent pricing policy. Instead of utilizing subscription pricing like many of its peers, Snowflake has opted to charge users based on how much data they store and how many Snowflake Compute Credits they use.But in spite of these well-defined competitive edges, justifying Snowflake's premium valuation has been challenging. Its days of triple-digit sales growth are long gone. With businesses still cautious about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, Snowflake's annual sales growth is expected to slow to approximately 22% in the current fiscal year. At north of 160 times estimated earnings per share, investors might be wise to keep their distance and allow Snowflake to grow into its current valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-22 08:25:00+00:00,Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple and New York Community Bank,"Chicago, IL – March 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights The Apple AAPL and New York Community Bank NYCB.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.Today, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a “free market” person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.Weakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank was underperforming – a subtle clue of the damage to come.Currently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.AAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume – a bearish sign.Apple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the “wow” factor in new iPhone releases.Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire’s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.Flat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

2024-03-22 04:40:20+00:00,15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages,"In this article, we will look at the 15 US states with the highest labor shortages. We have also discussed the implications of the labor shortages for businesses. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages. The labor shortage gripping the United States is starkly evident: with 9.5 million job openings but only 6.5 million unemployed workers, a deficit of 3 million remains. Despite the addition of 4.5 million jobs in 2022, the shortage persists, exacerbated by declining labor force participation rates since before the pandemic. This shortage spans industries and states, impacting businesses of all sizes and types, hindering their ability to fill essential roles. It is worth highlighting that healthcare is one of the most affected industries due to labor shortages in the US. Several factors contribute to this crisis. Early retirements increased during the pandemic, with over 3 million adults opting for early retirement by October 2021. Simultaneously, net international migration plummeted, slowing population growth and constraining the labor pool. Moreover, shifts in economic dynamics, such as increased savings due to enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, compounded the shortage. The ""Great Reshuffle"" saw record quit rates as workers sought better opportunities or opted for entrepreneurship. While solutions are being pursued, the multifaceted nature of the shortage demands comprehensive approaches addressing retirement trends, immigration policies, childcare accessibility, and economic incentives to entice workers back into the labor force.Owing to the major labor shortages in country, several businesses across the country have been disrupted. Thousands of businesses have reduced hours or closed due to unfilled positions, causing a ripple effect in various industries. The scarcity of workers not only slows production but also leads to price pressures on goods ranging from cars to household essentials like baby formula and cleaning products. To read more about skilled labor shortages, see the countries with the highest labor shortages in the world. The situation is dire, with over 50 million US workers leaving their jobs in 2022, the highest number on record. Economists have termed it ""quiet quitting"". However, there's nothing subtle about the challenges facing America's workforce. Industries such as transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare are particularly hard-hit, struggling to find essential personnel like truck drivers, hotel staff, and healthcare technicians. It is also worth highlighting that a substantial portion of these labor shortages are essentially skill labor shortages. To address these skill shortages, many companies have been trying to bridge the gap through several initiatives. For example, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers free education and training programs to equip learners with AI skills for tomorrow’s workforce. With AI transforming various industries, including finance, IT, sales, and marketing, demand for AI-trained professionals is growing. A survey conducted in four US regions revealed that over 60% of educators believe AI skills are essential for future high-paying careers. However, despite this recognition, many educators lack resources to teach AI effectively, with 69% reporting a shortage of necessary materials and training programs. To read more about AI transformation, see industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies. The study also suggests a modest increase in AI courses in US schools, expected to rise by approximately 1.5 times in the next five years. Recognizing the need to bridge this gap, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched its AI Ready initiative, aiming to provide free AI skills training to 2 million individuals by 2025. The initiative aligns with findings that show strong demand for AI talent, with potential salary increases of up to 47% for workers with AI skills. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports educators and students through various programs, including funding STEM curriculum, offering scholarships, and providing career exploration opportunities.Looking ahead, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has partnered with industry experts to predict AI-enabled careers of the future. These roles span diverse sectors, from precision farming analysts leveraging AI to optimize agricultural processes to cosmic reality engineers visualizing distant galaxies using advanced AI systems. As AI continues to reshape industries, preparing students and professionals with foundational AI skills becomes crucial. By investing in education and training, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)  aims to empower individuals for a tech-enabled workforce, fostering innovation and addressing the evolving demands of tomorrow’s job market.On the other hand, Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched updated professional training and certifications for IT support and management, responding to the growing demand for skilled technical staff. With projections indicating faster-than-average growth in computer and information systems occupations from 2020 to 2030, the need for proficient IT professionals is evident. This demand is further fueled by the increasing use of  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac in workplaces. The redesigned training is now available online, providing self-paced learning opportunities.The training comprises two sequential courses:  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  Device Support and  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Deployment and Management. These courses equip learners with essential skills for supporting and managing  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, covering topics such as device deployment, management, and security using mobile device management solutions. Upon completion of each course, learners can take certification exams to demonstrate their competence, enhancing their job prospects in the competitive IT landscape.To ensure accessibility,  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  offers scholarships for exam fees through its Community Education Initiative (CEI) at partnering institutions. Additionally, the Mac Admins Foundation collaborates with  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  to provide vouchers to applicants with financial need, promoting inclusivity and affordability in accessing certification exams.Gts/Shutterstock.comTo list the states with the highest labor shortages, we used unemployment level for the number of workers available in each states and utilized the averaged data between September and November 2023 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We calculated the ratio of workers available for every 100 job openings. The list is presented in descending order. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Despite efforts like Operation Make Movement to expedite housing subsidies, staffing constraints persist, with a workforce survey revealing a 21% vacancy rate across organizations. To address this crisis, the D.C. Council approved a bill funding graduate degrees in social work, aiming to alleviate shortages by subsidizing education for 20 Washingtonians initially, with plans to expand to 40 annually. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50Colorado has a strong labor force with a 68.8% participation rate, 5 points above the national average, and a pre-pandemic unemployment rate of 3.2%, below the national average. Before the pandemic, there were 79 workers for every 100 open positions. As of August 2023, the labor market has largely recovered, with unemployment and participation rates back to pre-pandemic levels. However, a worsening worker shortage is evident, with only 50 workers available for every 100 open jobs.Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50As one of the states with the worst labor shortages in 2024, Tennessee is also struggling with a concerning teacher shortage, as revealed by a recent analysis from the State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE). Statewide, there are approximately 60,000 teachers in the workforce, with over 1,000 unfilled vacancies, a third of which are in the critical K-5 grade band. While nearly a third of districts reported no vacancies, the state's shortage aligns with the national average. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47As one of the states that need the most workers, Virginia was ranked in the ""more severe"" category, according to the US Chamber of Commerce. Data reveals a stark contrast from pre-pandemic times, with 245,000 job openings and only 112,959 unemployed workers, resulting in 47 available workers for every 100 open positions. Despite rebounding labor force participation rates and low unemployment figures, the state faces challenges in filling vacancies, exacerbated by factors like decreased immigration and pandemic-induced workforce shifts. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47The state of Montana is plagued with a severe labor deficit with a Worker Shortage Index at 0.47. Job openings have increased to 35,000 while only 14,691 are unemployed. The labor force participation rate stagnates at 62.7, with a mere 2.5% unemployment rate. The quit rate peaks at 3.1, confirming dissatisfaction, while the hiring rate rests at 4.8.Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43South Carolina is fighting with an alarming labor shortage, particularly evident in the agricultural sector. Titan Farms, one of the largest peach growers on the East Coast, is currently facing the challenge of filling 1,200 positions with only two U.S.-born workers willing to take on the job. The peach industry alone contributes $400 million to the state's economy, yet without the federal H-2A work visa program, crucial agricultural businesses like Titan Farms would struggle to survive. The shortage stems from a shift in the workforce as more South Carolinians pursue careers outside of farm labor, opting for professions such as electricians, bankers, and lawyers. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43Massachusetts faces a profound labor shortage with significant numbers indicating the severity. Approximately 10,000 Baby Boomers retire daily, contributing to the workforce gap. This situation is exacerbated by a national statistic showing 3.5 million more job openings than available workers. To address this, immigration reform is crucial, as immigrants significantly contribute to sectors like healthcare. Moreover, tackling housing costs and living expenses is vital for attracting and retaining talent within the state. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43Despite historically low immigrant populations, Maine's recent influx from Somalia and other African countries, particularly in cities like Portland and Lewiston, has supported the foreign-born demographic by about 1% between 2000 and 2022. The proposed Office of New Americans aims to address shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, education, and construction.Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43Alabama is facing a critical labor shortage, with only 57% of working-age adults actively seeking employment as of September 2023. This shortage amounts to nearly 100,000 more job openings than available workers. The scarcity of labor empowers workers to demand better wages and benefits, but it also poses challenges for businesses and policymakers. Unemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 40Nebraska faces a workforce challenge with only 40 available workers per 100 open jobs, resulting in a Worker Shortage Index of 0.39. Despite a low unemployment rate of 2.0%, job openings stand at 54,000 against 21,145 unemployed workers. The state's labor force participation rate is 69.2%, with a quit rate of 2.3% and a hiring rate of 3.6%. Click here to see the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.Suggested Articles:15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In Europe15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World15 Best Countries That Need English TeachersDisclosure: None. 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages is originally published on Insider Monkey.

2024-03-22 02:23:03+00:00,The DOJ’s blockbuster lawsuit against Apple boils down to long-running argument within tech,"The legal showdown between the U.S. Department of Justice and Apple, which kicked off on Thursday morning, puts the spotlight on a thorny question that’s as old as the tech industry itself: How much control should a company have over its own creation?From the early days of personal computers to later debates over open source versus proprietary software, walled garden social networks versus open platforms, and even the recent push for so-called right to repair laws, it’s an issue that has come up—in some form or another—time and time again.To hear the DOJ tell it, Apple has exercised excessive control over the iPhone, thereby limiting choices for consumers and protecting its profits. “This case is about freeing the smartphone market from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” reads the introduction to the 88-page complaint filed by the DOJ.Apple, of course, sees things differently. A spokesperson for the tech giant told the Verge that it sets “a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”Indeed, the idea that Apple’s products “just work” has long been a central pillar of the company’s branding — consumers don’t need to know what a software driver is, or spend hours on the phone with tech support, to use an Apple product; just plug it in and have fun. The tightly scripted experience is the selling point.And the tight control that Apple exerts on the platform—in terms of the third-party apps it allows in its App store and the ability for third-party apps to access some of the iPhone's key functionality—has meant greater security and privacy for users in its castle.In Apple's last fiscal year, that approach helped the company generate $383 billion in revenue, inspiring Wall Street investors to bid Apple’s stock market value to $2.65 trillion. The iPhone, a product that will celebrate its 17th birthday in June, brought in $200 billion in revenue last year.“Apple's obsession with its customer experience leads it to control the experience tightly, make decisions on its customers' behalf, and maintain an ecosystem that consistently delivers on the experience the brand promises,” Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at industry research firm Forrester, told Fortune. In essence, Chatterjee said, it’s a debate between whether users are better off with choice or curation.To show that the market is craving more choice, instead of Apple’s tightly chaperoned model, the DOJ and the 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that joined it in the lawsuit, will have to demonstrate that consumers have been harmed.That won’t be easy—not just because of the existence of an alternative, less rigidly controlled smartphone ecosystem based on Google’s Android software.“This is not timid litigation,” New York University law professor and antitrust expert Harry First said, noting that the government is “going after the heart of Apple's ecosystem and how Apple maintains control.”Among the elements of the iPhone that the government says Apple stifles consumer choice on are the cloud-based gaming apps, messaging apps, and digital wallets.Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, one of the states involved in the lawsuit, told Fortune in an interview that the Apple Wallet is a prime example of limited choice. “If consumers prefer it against other digital payment systems that’s fine, but what shouldn’t be happening is Apple preventing the use of alternatives that consumers may want to use but can’t.”Still, the idea that the government understands what consumers want better than a company like Apple is inherently tricky. And there’s no shortage of examples of government heavy handedness leading to inferior products.Steve Sinfosky, a former senior executive at Microsoft, pointed to the constraints imposed on the PC software giant following the DOJ’s antitrust case against it in the late 1990s and early 2000s.The biggest impact of the antitrust litigation, Sinosky tweeted Thursday, was to make Windows “worse for consumers.”Proving that Apple’s control harmed other companies might be easier. But here, antitrust experts like Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management professor Mark McCareins say, the government will need to come with the goods, like internal communications between Apple executives that show that the company’s conduct was exclusionary — that is, done without a legitimate business purpose such as improving the customer experience.“What documents and emails are unearthed in discovery by the DOJ will be critical,” said McCareins, who teaches courses on Antitrust and Competition.Sinofsky, the former Microsoft executive, echoed this sentiment in his tweet thread on Thursday: “If this ever goes to trial you can bet that this case will distill down to a single-digit number of emails (there were 3 memorable ones in the MS case, IMO) or worse internal chat posts or Messages.”So far, the internal emails highlighted in the complaint, while revealing, are not damning, according to many observers. As the case moves forward however and the government gets deeper access to Apple documents, it’s difficult to know what might emerge.While a “smoking gun” document would of course be a huge boon to the government’s case, the DOJ may see a benefit even if it only manages to expose a trove of less dispositive documents, according to the opinion of some observers.“They must know this case will be hard to win. Maybe they feel their best path to victory is creating a strong public atmosphere that Apple is not some noble, pro-consumer actor,” said Geoffrey Manne, president and founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a Portland-based nonprofit research center.“A lot of these cases are about changing the public perception of these companies, which in turn deters the behavior.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/doj-blockbuster-lawsuit-against-apple-022303481.html
2024-03-22 00:15:02+00:00,20 Countries with the Worst English Accents in the World,"In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the worst English accents in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Worst English Accents in the World. English is one of the most spoken languages in the world, with approximately 1.5 billion speakers around the globe. It is recognized as an international business language and is taught as a mandatory skill in most of the countries. According to a report by The University of Winnipeg, 142 countries worldwide teach English as a mandatory element of their national curriculums. Moreover, 41 countries treat it as a popular foreign language.Speaking good English brings enhanced business opportunities and attracts growth and profitability. According to a survey conducted by EF English First, business customers were willing to pay 16% extra to a supplier with a high level of English proficiency. On the other hand, 53% of the respondents view organizations without a good grasp of English as unprofessional. In addition, the subsequent research on the survey found that a high level of English proficiency could help grow your business by 31% in 5 years. According to data, the United States, the United Kingdom, and European countries have the best English accents. These highly proficient English-speaking countries are also recognized as some of the world's most advanced economies.According to the World Economic Outlook Report 2024 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth in the advanced economies is projected to slow down slightly to 1.6% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024 before rising again to 1.8% in 2025. In the United States, growth is anticipated to decline from 2.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, attributed to stringent fiscal and monetary policies and a deceleration in aggregate demand within the labor market. On the other hand, the economic growth in the euro region is expected to recover from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.9% in 2024, finally reaching 1.7% in 2025. The resilient comeback of the European economy is due to strong household consumption after a drop in inflation and oil prices and an improvement in real income growth. You can also look at the 12 Most Profitable Foreign Languages To Learn and Top 25 Most Spoken Languages In The World 2024. The economic outlook for the United Kingdom remains stable, with growth forecasted to increase from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.6% in 2024 and projected to reach 1.6% by 2025. These growth projections are moderate due to the influence of persistently high energy prices within the UK. Nevertheless, declining inflation rates and an uptick in real income are key drivers fueling this economic expansion.The United States is one of the leading economies of the world and it is also one of the countries with the highest English proficiency. Foreigners from various countries learn English and move to the United States, seeking better employment opportunities. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the immigrant share of the total workforce in the United States reached an all-time high of 18.6% in 2023. Moreover, the immigrant labor force in the United States grows by 2.3% each year.

2024-03-21 21:51:12+00:00,UPDATE 6-Apple accused of monopolizing smartphone markets in US antitrust lawsuit,"(Adds new EU probes, White House comment, closing share price, details, paragraphs 6, 9, 14, 18)By Stephen Nellis, Andrew Goudsward and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice and 15 states on Thursday sued Apple as the government cracks down on Big Tech, alleging the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices.Apple joins competitors sued by regulators, including Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""The Justice Department said that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes larger profit than any others in the industry. Officials also said Apple charges various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even its rivals such as Google - behind the scenes in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers and drive up Apple's profit.Dating back to its time as a marginal player in the personal computer market, Apple's business model has long been based on charging users a premium for technology products where the company dictates nearly all of the details of how the device works and can be used. The Justice Department seeks to unwind that business model by forcing Apple, which has a market value of $2.7 trillion, to offer users more choices around how apps can tap in to the hardware that Apple designs.Shares of the iPhone maker fell 4.1% to close at $171.37 on Thursday.CHANGES SOUGHTApple denied the allegations made by the government.""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.""White House assistant press secretary Michael Kikukawa said: ""President Biden strongly supports fair and robust enforcement of the antitrust laws.""The Justice Department, which was also joined by the District of Columbia in the lawsuit, is seeking changes at Apple. An official suggested some form of breakup or reduction of the size of Apple was a possibility when they noted ""structural relief is also a form of equitable relief.""The 88-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. federal court in Newark, New Jersey, said it was focused on “freeing smartphone markets from Apple's anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future.”In the lawsuit, the U.S. accused Apple of making it harder for consumers to block competitors and cited five examples where Apple used mechanisms to suppress technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones: so-called super apps, cloud stream game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.For example, the U.S. alleges Apple made it more difficult for competing messaging apps and smartwatches to work smoothly on its phones. It also alleges that Apple's app store policies around streaming services for games have hurt competition.The Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States, where most analysts believe Apple has slightly more than half of the market. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market, where the iPhone has only one-fifth of consumers.The Justice Department quoted an email chain from Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who died in 2011, saying that it was ""not fun to watch"" how easily consumers could switch from iPhones to Android phones and vowing to ""force"" developers to use its payment systems in an effort to lock in both developers and consumers.It is unclear what specific changes the Justice Department seeks. The complaint asks a court to prevent Apple from using its control of app distribution, contracts and use of private software interfaces to undermine rivals and to order anything else necessary ""to restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by Apple’s unlawful conduct.""Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games.On Thursday Reuters reported that Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google will be investigated for potential violations of the European Union's Digital Markets Act that could lead to hefty fines by the end of the year, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.In Europe, Apple's App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores.(Reporting by Doina Chiacu, David Shepardson and Andrew Goudsward in Washington and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco Editing by Chris Sanders, Lisa Shumaker and Matthew Lewis)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/1-us-takes-apple-antitrust-144010191.html

Shares in Nvidia were also a big boost as it added more than 1%while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rallied 2.3%.U.S. stock indexes had also boasted record closing levels on Wednesday after U.S. central bankers kept borrowing costs unchanged and indicated they still expect to ease interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of 2024.""Earnings results are keeping semiconductors as market leaders but more broadly a risk on mode has stemmed from the dovish Fed on Wednesday,"" said Matthew Miskin, Co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said told reporters after the Fed's policy meeting on Wednesday that inflation reports ""haven't really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes bumpy road to 2%.""But John Hancock's Miskin questioned whether the Fed is being overly optimistic about inflation and rate cuts.""They're opening to door to let inflation risk seep back into the market. It's not there yet but it's a risk that could come later this year,"" he said.In the meantime, however, economic data released earlier on Thursday added to investors' bullish moods.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, while sales of previously owned homes increased by the most in a year in February, signs the economy remained on solid footing in the first quarter.""This economy continues to defy expectations and markets are loving every minute of it,"" said Miskin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 269.24 points, or 0.68% , to 39,781.37, the S&P 500 gained 16.91 points, or 0.32%, to 5,241.53 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 32.43 points, or 0.20%, to 16,401.84.Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 industry sectors were higher, with industrials leading gains and finishing up 1%. The weakest sector was utilities, which ended down 0.2%, followed by a 0.17% drop in communications services , which saw its biggest drag from Alphabet, down 0.8%.Goldman Sachs closed up 4.4%, leading gains in the Dow and in the rate sensitive bank sector. The S&P 500 bank sector added 1.7%.Apple bucked the market trend by closing down 4.1% after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the iPhone maker, the first major antitrust effort against the company by the Biden administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.Shares in IT services provider Accenture tumbled 9% after it cut its fiscal-year 2024 revenue forecast, with economic uncertainty prompting its clients to cut consulting services spending.Reddit shares closed at $50.44 after it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time with at $47, which was 38% above its $34 initial public offer price.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE which showed 918 new highs and 56 new lows.On the Nasdaq Composite, 1,776 stocks rose and 1,400 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.27-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 posted 116 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq recorded 365 new highs and 59 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 11.43 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.39 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Maju Samuel and Aurora Ellis)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/us-stocks-wall-street-hits-204356194.html

And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it’s complying with the region’s Digital Markets Act.Shares of the company slid 4.1% Thursday, erasing about $113 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%. Once the world’s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024.It’s not the first time Apple is coming under regulatory scrutiny. The company and its peers have for years faced accusations of enriching themselves by suppressing competitors. But as Apple’s products have grown ever-more popular and established themselves as part of daily life around the world, authorities have also become more combative and wary of its power.Read more: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTakeThe American suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, accuses Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The potential investigations in Europe, which are also targeting some of Apple’s rivals, will focus on the firm’s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers.“There comes a point in which the downpour of cases and scrutiny that comes with them become a real drag on how these companies operate,” said Bill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School. “Even if they win, in an important way they’ve lost.”Apple fired back at the US lawsuit by calling it “wrong on the facts and the law.” It warned that the action would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment on the potential European probes.The US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.It highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”The Digital Markets Act — which lays out a series of do’s and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations into Apple — as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google — regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.Apple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) European Union fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein and Stephanie Bodoni.(Updates share reaction in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-21 21:09:44+00:00,"Apple's antitrust fallout, Reddit's debut: Thursday's market takeaways","The DOJ launched its antitrust suit against Magnificent 7 tech giant Apple (AAPL). While shares of the company fell, the remainder of the tech sector seemed relatively unscathed.Social media giant Reddit (RDDT) debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in the afternoon with shares of the company trading above its target price of $34 per share. The stock is currently trading at just under $50 per share during extended hours.Inflation risks remain noteworthy as Fed officials weighted Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) to the upside. Strong earnings could also spell trouble for the market going forward.Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins the Live show to break down Thursday's market takeaways.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- Josh Schafer is here with the takeaways from the trading day. Joshua.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, Josh. We had Apple down today in the market up. This is a trend, of course, we've been seeing for a little bit now. But it just stuck out to me. Our friend Sam Rowe actually highlighted this on Twitter. There weren't a lot of days in the past when you go back over the past couple of years really, maybe even the past decade that you see a stock like Apple, a major tech stock, a big tech stock that drives the market fall over 3%, and still everything is up. And even tech is up, right?- Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: And you have sort of a pretty big deal here coming with Apple that you could argue could span two other tech companies. You sort of wonder where that reaches out to you. And normally, that would cause some sort of-- I don't know-- I guess at least a little bit of anxiety, you would think--- Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: --amongst investors. But when you look across the NASDAQ 100 today, we just didn't really see that. And I think perhaps maybe just a sign, guys, of the overall sentiment right now, well, OK, that's an Apple problem. But the rest of tech is fine. Let's keep buying the rest of tech. And that's just an Apple issue. And I don't think that's always really kind of been the case for that stock.- No, it hasn't been. I mean, you know, also, man Reddit bankers must have been breathing a sigh of relief today that the IPO came on this day, in particular, when the overall market was up when sentiment seemed pretty decent. And they got a big pop in the stock. It took a while for it to open. But when it finally did--JOSH SCHAFER: It took a while for it to open, but it closed above where it opened, right? So we know that it was priced--- By a lot.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, it was priced at $34. And then it actually opened at $47. So it actually closed above that. You can see on your screen now at 50. And one of the other takeaways I sort of had here was, yes, it closed up by a lot but maybe not in aggressive-- I just didn't know what to expect from Reddit. I felt like we could have had maybe total meme stock mania reaction here, whether it be to the downside or the upside.And to me, maybe one of the takeaways from just this sort of market action was, OK, it was an IPO. Like, it was a normal IPO relatively-- like, we've seen this happen before with the stock going up compared to where it was priced at the night before. That's not necessarily a totally outrageous jump. Of course, we're talking about-- as you mentioned, Julie, I think it started trading at 12:30. So what--- Yes, it took a while.JOSH SCHAFER: --three hours of trading is sort of what we're overanalyzing here.- Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: We'll have to watch how the stock moves over the next couple of months. But I thought it was interesting just to see nothing necessarily too crazy.- Nothing broke.JOSH SCHAFER: Nothing broke.- Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: That's always good.- Yeah, that's a win.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.- It's such an interesting kind of company to think about too because-- I mean, you have this huge user base and really healthy top-line growth, Josh. But on the other hand, you did hear-- you know, you had questions about a company that's been around this long but still posting the kind of losses they were doing in 2023. So some puts and takes there were interesting to watch.JOSH SCHAFER: It's going to be interesting, Josh, as people sort of continue to dig into the business here and we get closer to an actual earnings report where we have the Street creating expectations here. How does that company match when you think about a lot of the companies that are in this space that are perhaps comparable when you think of a Snapchat, when you think of a Pinterest?Those companies haven't necessarily had great earnings reports going back over the last couple of years as we talk about the broader ad market and some of the slowdown we've seen there. So be interesting to see what happens with Reddit as it comes a little bit more under Wall Street's microscope and sort of the euphoria of the IPO kind of fades.- And then finally, as we continue to digest the fed, everything's all right, right? Inflation is going to come down. Everything's going to be OK.JOSH SCHAFER: No, Julie, that was my take yesterday, right? So yesterday, I was all positive. I felt too positive. When I walked off with you guys, I said, guys, I'm going to come back with some sort of bear spin. We got to calm down a little bit here.So I wanted to highlight one of the inflation risks that some people are still talking about here. Jon Hilsenrath, who used to cover the fed for ""The Wall Street Journal,"" very prominent reporter, highlighted this. And it's interesting. This was deep in the summary of economic projections, what you're looking at on your screen now.And this is risk-to-core PCE inflation. You're looking at how many fed officials saw broadly balanced risks versus weighted to the upside. Weighted to the upside is in purple. Light blue is what they saw in December. So you actually saw more officials highlighting that the risk could be to the upside on inflation, which I found rather interesting.It's just something to keep in mind like, yes, we were excited about the economic growth that the fed upgraded. We were excited that the cut stayed at 3. But that core PCE number did come up. And you wonder at what point maybe that is a risk.And then, guys, I do have one other risk that I found too that I found rather interesting when we think about the markets overall and tying it in. Earnings estimates right now are just insanely high. And if we're thinking about a market potentially being priced to perfection in some ways, it's been interesting just to think about earnings estimates.We're looking at Q4 earnings expected to grow 17% year over year. And it just seems interesting to wonder if that can hold up. We know earnings often normally come down. Those estimates usually come down.So if we're pricing-- if the market is pricing things correctly right now, maybe as those estimates come down, that's where we see a pullback. That's something that some of the strategists that are suggesting we're going to see a pullback in the near term were wondering, OK, when we start to maybe come back down to Earth with these estimates, maybe that's when the S&P comes a little bit back down to Earth and stops going up every day.- Maybe.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe. Or maybe it just goes up every day, Josh.- It could happen. We'll bring you back. Schafer, thank you.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apples-antitrust-fallout-reddits-debut-210944986.html
2024-03-21 21:00:22+00:00,"DOJ calls out Apple for breaking iMessage-on-Android solution, Beeper","The U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Apple filed on Thursday cites the iPhone maker’s battle against Beeper, the app that aimed to bring iMessage to Android users. Beeper gave up on its mission after Apple blocked the app’s efforts late last year. The DOJ referenced the dispute in its lawsuit as an example of Apple controlling ""the behavior and innovation of third parties in order to insulate itself from competition.""Beeper, a startup from Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, managed to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol to bring support for end-to-end encrypted blue bubble iMessage chats to Android users. Beeper functioned as a true iMessage client, supporting threads, replies, read receipts, direct messages and group chats, tapback emoji reactions, editing and more.As soon as Beeper launched, the companies entered into a game of cat-and-mouse, which Apple ultimately won. Each time Beeper issued workarounds and fixes to keep the service afloat, Apple knocked them down one by one. The dispute led to a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asking the DOJ to investigate Apple’s anticompetitive treatment of the app.“Recently, Apple blocked a third-party developer from fixing the broken cross-platform messaging experience in Apple Messages and providing end-to-end encryption for messages between Apple Messages and Android users,” the DOJ complaint reads. “By rejecting solutions that would allow for cross-platform encryption, Apple continues to make iPhone users’ less secure than they could otherwise be.”Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsAt the time of the dispute, Apple argued that Beeper “posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.”The battle between the two companies has also caught the eye of FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who in February asked the agency to investigate Apple’s actions through the lens of the FCC’s Part 14 rules on accessibility, usability and compatibility.The DOJ cited the battle between the two companies as part of a broader argument accusing Apple of protecting its smartphone monopoly to undermine cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones. The department argues that Apple is “knowingly and deliberately degrading quality, privacy, and security for its users.”The lawsuit also accuses Apple of suppressing smartwatch cross-platform compatibility, which is something that Migicovsky previously dealt with at Pebble, a smartwatch company that shut down in 2016. The DOJ notes that in 2013, Apple started offering users the ability to connect their iPhones with third-party smartwatches and gave third-party smartwatch developers access to various APIs related to the Apple Notification Center Service, Calendar, Contacts and geolocation. When Apple launched the Apple Watch the following year, it began limiting third-party access to new and improved APIs for smartwatch functionality.The DOJ notes that Apple prevents iPhone users from responding to notifications using a third-party smartwatch. The department says that Apple instead provides third-party smartwatches access to more limited APIs that don't allow users to do things that are available on its own Apple Watch, such as responding to a message or accepting a calendar invite.The lawsuit goes as far as accusing Apple of having ""copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers.""For more on Apple’s antitrust lawsuit, check here: Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsDOJ claims green bubbles are an issue in Apple iPhone antitrust lawsuitWhy Apple’s antitrust lawsuit could be a silver lining for Epic GamesApple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopoly Epic, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group and others applaud DOJ’s Apple lawsuitThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/doj-calls-out-apple-for-breaking-imessage-on-android-solution-beeper/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/doj-calls-apple-breaking-imessage-181731882.html
2024-03-21 20:55:39+00:00,Why China's options in response to a TikTok ban are limited,"Chinese officials decried the lack of “fairness” in the US last week following the swift passage of a House bill that called for Chinese company ByteDance to divest its popular social media app TikTok.A foreign ministry spokesperson for China accused the US of using national security as a guise to “willfully suppress other countries' superior companies,” strongly hinting that the Chinese government would block any forced sale of its most popular social media app.But beyond preventing a spin-off, Chinese options for potential retaliation against the US remain limited, given the country’s current economic standing and its own policy of censorship, experts say.“The more that they take sort of retaliatory measures, that actually turbocharges that decoupling agenda that some have in Washington,” said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at The Peterson Institute for International Economics. “[That] would encourage firms to pull out of China because they wouldn't feel safe there.”The latest congressional action marks another twist in a yearslong effort to limit the scale and influence of a social media app that has grown to more than 170 million users in the US.Since launching in 2017 as the international version of parent company ByteDance’s popular Chinese app Douyin, TikTok has become one of the most downloaded apps globally, along with Meta’s (META) Instagram.But the vast amounts of data collected on the platform, as well as concerns about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to exert control over ByteDance, has raised the alarm for US lawmakers who have deemed TikTok’s ties to China a national security risk.In congressional testimony, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has insisted that the company stores Americans' data in Virginia and Singapore, not China. However, the company later acknowledged there are some exceptions for creator data, as Forbes reported.“The Chinese government does have broad legal authorities to compel corporations in matters of national security,” said Colin Costello, a CFIUS and national security adviser at the Freshfields law firm. “So from the perspective of someone who views the Chinese government as an adversary and as a very capable adversary, the question is not has it been used, but can it be used? And the answer to that, ... from the perspective of the people who wrote this bill, is yes.”This isn't the first time Beijing has responded to threats of a US TikTok ban.In 2020, after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively calling for the ban of TikTok and WeChat in the US, ByteDance immediately moved to update its export control rules. The changes restricted the export of “technology based on data analysis for personalized information recommendation service.”Reva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, expects Beijing to intervene similarly if the Senate passes the House bill and President Joe Biden signs it into law to “demonstrate its own resistance to the US.”But China’s own economic reality and a broad slowdown in foreign investments may also influence Beijing’s calculation in the scale of its response. Foreign direct investments in China fell to a 30-year low in 2023, weighed down in part by concerns over geopolitical tensions and an unpredictable business environment.“Beijing needs to weigh the risk of further alienating foreign investors when China’s economic challenges are already on full display,” Goujon said. “More defensive moves, whether on export controls, data security, or cybersecurity measures, will only drive companies deeper down the diversification path.”That hasn’t stopped Beijing from responding in the past. Major American social media and online platforms, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Meta’s Facebook, and Snapchat (SNAP), have already been banned from the world’s second-largest economy.The government also barred critical domestic infrastructure operators from purchasing Micron’s (MU) products last year, after Washington implemented export controls on key American components and chipmaking tools. Months later, China ordered employees at central government agencies to stop using Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, citing national security concerns.If passed in the Senate, the TikTok bill sets a six-month deadline for TikTok to divest from ByteDance, a challenging scenario given the complexity of separating US assets from a global app.Chorzempa said Beijing is unlikely to approve any deal, regardless of the price tag or corporate structure, in part because of what TikTok represents: a global social media success story made in China.“If Beijing is looking at a ban in the United States market compared to losing global control [over an app], it's not clear to me that it would prefer divestment and a payout for the existing shareholders over the loss of that channel,” Chorzempa said.In part, he added, that's because the “abundance of Chinese actions in the last few years makes clear that the interests of shareholders and the financial interests of shareholders just do not come in very high on the list of Chinese government priorities.”Click here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/why-chinas-options-in-response-to-a-tiktok-ban-are-limited-205539981.html

The group includes a number of key app makers, including Epic Games, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group, Proton and others.""With today's announcement, the Department of Justice is taking a strong stand against Apple’s stranglehold over the mobile app ecosystem, which stifles competition and hurts American consumers and developers alike,” said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the CAF. ""The DOJ complaint details Apple’s long history of illegal conduct – abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition. The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple’s abusive behavior and are working to address it.""Some of the CAF's members, like Epic and Spotify, have been embroiled in high-profile legal proceedings over Apple's anticompetitive practices.For years, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been vocal about his displeasure with Apple's 30% cut of in-app payments, which he thinks is monopolistic and predatory. In 2020, Epic made it possible for Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, rather than giving a cut to Apple. Then, Apple removed Epic from the App Store, which sparked a slew of legal proceedings. Though Epic has seen some victories -- now, developers are allowed to route users to alternative payment methods -- Apple has not been proven to be a monopoly in any of these lawsuits. As the Digital Markets Act (DMA) took effect in the European Union, Spotify has become more antagonistic toward Apple. The DMA was supposed to facilitate competition in the EU, but Spotify called Apple's plans for DMA compliance -- which add additional developer fees -- ""a complete and total farce.""In a thread on X, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said: ""I was skeptical of Apple’s intentions to comply after years of watching them get away with such extreme abuse with all the ways they skirt regulations around the world. Who wouldn’t be? But the law is the law, right? Not if you are Apple…""But Apple sees the CAF as the bad guy. In a briefing with journalists about the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit, Apple displayed a slide that positioned the CAF as part of a web of corporations trying to take Apple down for their own gain.In a statement, Apple said: ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.

2024-03-21 20:40:59+00:00,5 Fascinating Facets of DOJ’s Apple Monopoly Lawsuit,"The Department of Justice believes Apple is playing dirty to squash competition, so the DOJ sued the iPhone company on Thursday, in a case joined by more than 15 state attorneys general.According to the lawsuit, Apple is accused of trying to monopolize the smartphone market with practices like setting unfair rules and fees in its App Store, locking people into its ecosystem and stifling competition in multiple ways across its software, platform and devices.More from WWDStyling Workflow Tool Sève Names Fashion Director'Manhunt' Costume Designer Katie Irish Took a Bold Approach to Dressing the Victorian PeriodCart.com Launches Constellation AI for Automated and Simplified Product Merchandising and Inventory ManagementIt’s a sprawling case that has experts poring over the details. But along the way, a few other interesting tidbits have emerged. Here are five fascinating facets of the case.1) Message’s blue and green bubbles could go bye-byeThe DOJ specifically called out Message bubbles, which allows iPhone users to identify nonusers. Fellow i-people can send each other high-quality videos and pictures, but Apple degrades the quality for Android-to-iPhone cross-border multimedia messaging, it said.Few people would argue with improving quality, but some people might be sad to see the color coding go — like single people in the dating scene. Message bubbles have been a sort of vetting tool, with blue (marking a text from a fellow iPhone user) and green (denoting another platform, primarily Android) signaling a romantic partner’s likely class or financial status. Whether that’s accurate is debatable, but it doesn’t matter to the dating hordes that turned it into a social phenomenon — especially after Android smartphone makers began pumping out an enormous array of budget models.2) Some irritating things could go away — like signing up and paying online to use an account in an app, or the scourge of incompatible devicesApple’s 30 percent cut goes deep, forcing some developers into an annoying sign-up process. This can kick users to the web to sign up and pay for memberships or subscriptions online, then urge them to come back to the app to log in. Fortunately, the Apple tax doesn’t affect brands selling physical products. But virtual fashion and other digital goods are another story.If Apple is required to open up iOS, so that other apps can forego the App Store (and the hefty fee), there would be no need for this annoying sign-up process. This could also usher in a wave of unscrupulous apps, if users can just download them from anywhere. Avoiding that is precisely why some people choose Apple gadgets. Others prefer the freedom to choose. The debate affects hardware, too. The court will weigh whether Apple is deliberately sabotaging connectivity with other technologies to unfairly favor its own, and the legalities of that. The potential result: Apple Watch paired with Android device, anyone?3) More choice of apps, wallets, third-party app stores and more are on the tableIn March, the European Union ruled that Apple must allow users to download apps from other sources, not just its App Store, to comply with its Digital Markets Act. This is opening the way for people to download software directly from the internet, at least in Europe. If the latest lawsuit succeeds, U.S. users could see the same thing. At least by then, Apple will have had some experience doing that.4) In its response, Apple listed a valid reason for users to worryMost people will probably skip over the company’s press statement as corporate fluff. But it actually contains a good point. The company prides itself on “designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.” In other words, the reason why Apple has a reputation as a premium tech provider is because of its strict control over its devices, operating system and services. That doesn’t excuse monopolistic practices, but there’s a legitimate risk of the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad or Mac being a lot less magical if it opens up to anything, including cruft and bad actors.There’s a fine line between hammering a nail and taking a sledgehammer to a platform, and if Apple loses, it’s not clear if the judgment will account for that.5) Microsoft once faced similar accusations…from AppleMicrosoft faced its own DOJ monopoly suit in 1998, in a landmark case for the tech industry. People who remember it know that the Redmond, Wash., tech giant lost, but what the public may not realize is Apple’s role. The irony is that the latter is now facing the same accusations it once lobbed at its Windows rival — a detail that the DOJ would like to remind everyone about. “In 1998, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs criticized Microsoft’s monopoly and ‘dirty tactics’ in operating systems to target Apple, which prompted the company ‘to go to the Department of Justice’ in hopes of getting Microsoft ‘to play fair,’” the department said in the filing. “But even at that time, Apple did not face the same types of restrictions it imposes on third parties today … “The DOJ called out the fact that Windows computers didn’t block iPod syncing, and Microsoft didn’t demand 30 percent of every song purchased in the PC version of iTunes. Then it went on, adding that “Similarly, when Apple brought the iPhone to market in 2007, it benefited from competition among component makers and wireless carriers.”The jab paints Apple as a thin-skinned hypocrite — one that wouldn’t be where it is today, if others demanded the same hoops that it now forces others to jump through.Best of WWDRetailers Leverage First Insight for ESG AlignmentWhat Steph Curry's Sneaker NFTs Can Teach FashionYear in Review: Brands, Retailers Go Hyper-digital in a Challenging Landscape",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPLhttps://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/5-fascinating-facets-doj-apple-204059204.html
2024-03-21 20:38:32+00:00,DOJ sues Apple: Can an antitrust case hurt Apple's bottom line?,"The US Department of Justice has levied an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) claiming the company engaged in activities meant to monopolize its presence in the smartphone and digital app markets. Many on Wall Street are wondering how this may affect Apple's reputation and bottom line.Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton and New York University School Of Law Professor Eleanor Fox join Yahoo Finance to discuss the DOJ's lawsuit against Apple and how it may sway investors and consumers.Clinton affirms the effect it may have on investors and users: ""I think investors will ultimately shrug this off, not only because it's going to take years to ultimately figure what is the resolution here, but I also think that even if we do get some changes to Wallet, maybe some changes to Watch, and maybe some changes to Messaging, I don't think any of those are going to be big enough changes to crack Apple's dominance in the smartphone market. I think the iPhone will probably lose almost no share in terms of the things we're talking about as far as part of this antitrust case.""Fox elaborates on the DOJ's arguments to try and sway users: ""The complaint itself begins with a story, and it is a story of when a user of a Kindle on Apple wants to switch and switches to a Kindle on Android, and Steve Jobs finds out about it, and he says this is very bad. That's sort of the beginning of the story that the DOJ is telling, is how Apple is trying to prevent consumers from switching at zero cost. ""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoJULIE HYMAN: Joining us now, Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner, Doug Clinton. Doug, thanks for being here. So we're all trying to get our arms around here, around this here, and try to figure out what the implications will be. Although it seems certain that they won't be immediate, or imminent, or even medium term. So how are you thinking about this?DOUG CLINTON: Julie, I think investors will ultimately shrug this off. Not only because it's going to take years to ultimately figure out what is the resolution here. But I also think that even if we do get some changes to wallet, maybe some changes to watch, and maybe some changes to messaging, I don't think any of those are going to be big enough changes to crack Apple's dominance in the smartphone market.I think the iPhone will probably lose almost no share in terms of the things we're talking about as part of this antitrust case. And so, ultimately, it's a scary headline. Apple will probably have to pay a several billion dollars fine as part of this. But I don't think that it threatens the overall ecosystem that they have built.JOSH LIPTON: Also with us right now is New York University School of Law professor, Eleanor Fox. Professor Fox, it is great to have you on the show as well. I guess, I want to bring just start high level, Professor.You've had time to look over the lawsuit. I'm just curious how strong you think it is.ELEANOR FOX: Thank you. Good to be here. I think this is a very strong lawsuit. It's very, very well-pleaded.It details many incidents of Apple taking action in order to prevent the competition from occurring. And so, basically, the thrust of it is that Apple has taken many actions to prevent competition, and therefore, raising the prices to consumers and cutting out options for consumers.JULIE HYMAN: Eleanor, I wonder if you can give us any kind of insight into how exactly the Department of Justice decides which of these types of cases to bring. There are a lot of companies out there. It seems as though lately, there have been a lot of cases against large tech companies, in particular.Is it a matter of the confidence they can win a case? How does this get worked out?ELEANOR FOX: Right. So it's a combination of things. So, of course, big tech is very much in the headlines. And people think big tech is very powerful.So they have a very high profile. And the Antitrust Division, as well as the FTC has been learning a lot and doing a lot in order to pursue what they think are big tech anti-competitive practices. And, of course, Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world by market cap.So it affects all of our lives, most of our lives. And I think those considerations have caused the Justice Department to sue.JOSH LIPTON: Doug, maybe you can walk me through one confusing part for me, which is I don't understand, Doug, where the consumer harm is. You look at customer satisfaction rates for iPhones. They are off the charts.I mean, it's literally like 98%. People love their iPhones. They buy them.Every fall, they buy new ones. If you didn't want to buy an iPhone, go buy an Android device. Tell me if you agree, or am I off track here.JOSH LIPTON: You are totally on track, Josh. I'm glad you brought it up. Because when you think about all these mega cap tech companies, there is a common thread, which is they are all the best service providers for the categories that they dominate. Amazon's the best retailer you can buy from. Google's is the best search engine. Meta has the best social apps.And what you see online just in general is because it is this open platform where there's zero cost of switching for most of these products. And I would argue zero cost of switching even for a phone, although you have to set up a new account, if you move to Android from iPhone.The best products just win. And they get this dominant market share. And so I struggle with the same question, Josh. I think that the consumers have ultimately benefited and won here despite the fact that we're seeing very high market shares from all of these leading internet companies.JULIE HYMAN: Eleanor, I suspect that Apple's argument will be similar to what Doug is saying. How successful is something like that going to be in court?ELEANOR FOX: Well, of course, the Department of Justice has a very different narrative and has allegations that Apple charges excessive prices. For example, for developers that want to sell premium products on Apple charges about 30%. And this would not happen if there were competition.The complaint itself begins with a story. And it is a story of when a user of a Kindle on Apple wants to switch and switches to a Kindle on Android. And Steve Jobs finds out about it. And he says this is very bad.And that's the beginning of the story. The story that the DOJ is telling is how Apple is trying to prevent consumers from switching at zero cost. A lot of the examples are about that.JULIE HYMAN: They are. And I'm sure we're going to hear much more about them as we all try to digest this and what it means. Thank you both so much for helping us understand it.

2024-03-21 18:44:45+00:00,Bank of England faces backlash for being ‘overly cautious’ on rates,"The Bank of England has been accused of putting caution before growth as it held interest rates at 5.25pc.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left borrowing costs unchanged for a fifth consecutive meeting but for the first time since September 2021, no-one voted for an increase in rates. One member voted for a cut in an 8-1 split.Money markets have priced in three quarter of a percentage point reductions in borrowing costs by the end of the year as Governor Andrew Bailey said “things are moving in the right direction”.Traders put the chances of a first rate cut in June at about 80pc.However, economists said policymakers were being “overly cautious” after inflation fell sharply to 3.4pc last month - with many forecasting it will drop to 2pc in April.Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, said the decision was “disappointing” but welcomed hints that cuts are “coming soon”.Mr Jessop said: “The big picture is still that monetary policy is too tight and the Bank has been too slow to cut rates. Nonetheless, the shift in tone today is important.”Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, said: “The Bank of England remains overly cautious on the prospect of rate cuts given the startling inflation slowdown and an economy in recession, increasing the risk they prolong our economic struggles by keeping policy too tight for too long.”Neil Shah, director at investment researcher Edison Group, said the Bank of England has prioritised “inflation management over immediate economic stimulus”.He added: “It appears that, in the delicate balancing act between supporting recovery and curbing inflation, the Bank is choosing caution, potentially at the expense of growth opportunities.”Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. We’ll be back in the morning but here’s Ben Marlow on Unilever’s plan to sell-off its ice-cream division:At last, some bold decision-making from Unilever, a company that has become synonymous with corporate drift and turned mediocrity into an art form. Not only that, but a move that could provide a much-needed boost to London’s dwindling status as a global financial centre.The consumer goods goliath has decided to hive off its ice cream operations, paving the way for an entirely new listed company to emerge on the London Stock Exchange at a time when the City is reeling from an exodus of top names. With a predicted value of £15bn for a business that includes big brands such as Wall’s and Magnum, the FTSE 100 should get a new constituent that resonates strongly with investors.There are suggestions that the Unilever board could choose to float the division in New York or Amsterdam instead but that shouldn’t even be a consideration.Read the full column...The competition watchdog has cleared plans by the publishers of The Sun and the Daily Mail to combine their printing operations.Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and Lord Rothermere’s DMG Media announced plans last October to combine their printing operations amid declining print sales.But the Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the deal last month.It said on Thursday that after an initial review, it had decided not to refer the deal for a further in-depth investigation.The new business is expected to start operations in June.The deal will result in the closure of DMG Media’s sites in Thurrock, Essex, and Dinnington, Sheffield.The group will retain three current Newsprinters sites owned by News UK in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire; Knowsley, Merseyside; and Glasgow.European competition regulators are expected to launch investigations into Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet’s Google, using newly introduced powers under the Digital Markets Act, reports say.The European Commission is expected to announce the investigations in the coming days, with decisions made before EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager’s term ends in November, Reuters said.Apple and Google’s fees and terms for app store developers are to be scrutinised, sources told Bloomberg.The Commission declined to comment. Apple, Google and Meta were approached for comment.The FTSE 100 closed up 1.88pc. The biggest riser was 3i, up 8.70pc, followed by Next, up 6.67pc. The biggest faller was Hikma Pharmaceuticals, down 4.82pc, followed by British American Tobacco, down 1.36pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 1.32pc. The biggest riser was mining company Hochschild, up 8.06pc, followed by magazine publisher Future, up 5.78pc. The biggest faller was industrial group Dowlais, down 9.72pc, followed by insurance firm Lancashire Holdings, down 4.76pc.International share indexes rallied further today after the Swiss National Bank became the first major central bank cut rates this morning. The Bank of England meanwhile said that “things are moving in the right direction”.Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve recommited to its outlook for 2024 rate cuts.The S&P 500 is up 0.6pc, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.8pc, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.8pc. In Europe, Germany’s DAX index is up 0.8pc, while France’s CAC 40 is up 0.2pc.UBS boss Sergio Ermotti said today that governments and regulators should not expect banks to act as the “climate police” in remarks that also cut against the demands of activists who say banks should vow never lend to fossil fuel industries.Bloomberg reported that he told a meeting of Swiss bankers that financial services “is an attractive target for policymakers” who wish to “divert at least some of the blame of unpopular decisions to banks”.He said:Banks should not be forced to take decisions on behalf of policymakers: we are part of the private sector and we need to represent and protect the interest of our diversified clients.While we are not comfortable taking on the role of standard setters for all economic actors or the climate police on behalf of authorities, we are confident in our duties as financial risk managers.Waitrose has revealed plans to shut a delivery warehouse in north London later this year, putting 545 jobs at risk.The supermarket chain has launched a consultation process over potentially shutting the site in Enfield, which only opened in 2020.The Enfield Customer Fulfilment Centre is a warehouse used to pick and deliver online orders for customers in some parts of North London, which was launched amid a boom in online grocery demand at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.A Waitrose spokesman said:With rental costs at Enfield due to increase and capacity elsewhere in our network, we are considering the closure of the site.While not an option we’re exploring lightly, the proposal would maintain our high levels of customer service for Waitrose.com and support future growth.It’s in no way a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our team.The planned job cuts are part of cost-cutting efforts at parent group John Lewis Partnership.Last week, Sharon White, chairman of the partnership, told reporters that there is “no target” for job cuts but indicated that some roles will be impacted by its turnaround strategy.Direct Line has set aside £150m to repay customers who were overcharged when renewing their policies or underpaid when claiming money back for written-off vehicles. Adam Mawardi reports:The British insurer has set aside the funds after two reviews by the City’s financial watchdog into its past business practices.One found that Direct Line wrongly charged existing insurance customers more for renewing their home or car insurance than they would have had to pay if they had been a new customer.The second investigation found drivers were given “unfair settlements” when their cars and vans were written off between 2017 and 2022.Both groups will now get compensation. Direct Line last year agreed to pay £30m in relation to overcharging renewal customers.Adam Winslow, chief executive of Direct Line said: “[W]e have worked very hard together with the regulator to put appropriate plans, both to remediate customers and crucially learn the lessons, and apply them in our business moving forwards.”The FTSE 250 insurance company on Thursday also announced plans to slash costs by around £100m by the end of 2025.The company hopes to reduce costs by increased automation and modernising IT systems. Mr Winslow on Thursday declined to comment on whether the plans will include layoffs and said he wanted to consult employees first.Three has suffered its first loss in 13 years as the mobile network warned that its £15bn merger with Vodafone was the only way to safeguard continued investment. James Warrington reports:Three UK swung to a loss of £117m in 2023 amid surging inflation and the growing cost of running its 5G network.That compared to a profit of £147m the previous year and marked the first time it has been in the red since 2010.The company slashed its capital expenditure by 40pc last year to £454m as costs jumped by almost a quarter to more than £1bn.Three, which has more than 10m customers in the UK, warned it lacked the scale to continue investing in its mobile infrastructure as it renewed its lobbying for a merger with Vodafone.The pair have been seeking a deal for months but have faced competition concerns and scrutiny of Three’s ties to China.Three reiterated its arguments that the planned merger was needed to secure future investment and challenge BT, which owns EE, and Virgin Media O2.A merger of Vodafone and Three would create the UK’s largest mobile network and the pair have vowed to invest £11bn in their combined 5G network over the next decade if the deal goes ahead.The competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the tie-up between Vodafone and Three amid concerns that reducing the number of UK mobile networks from four to three will push up prices for consumers.Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has said that inflation does not have to come down all the way to the UK target of 2pc before the Bank will cut rates.He told broadcasters:What we have to do is be convinced that it is going to go there.We should act ahead of time in that sense because we have to be forward looking.Asked about markets pricing in two or three interest rate cuts this year, he said:I’m not going to endorse the market here, but I think it’s reasonable that markets are taking that view given the way inflation has performed.But it’s not a prediction for me as to what’s going to happen, either on timing or amount, but I am encouraged.The Governor of the Bank of England has said “we’re on the way” towards cutting interest rates as inflation comes down to sustainable levels.He told broadcasters:We’ve had good news. Inflation has come down. It has come down as we have expected but we have still got some way to go, particularly with what I call the more persistent bits of inflation.That is particularly the services element, which is about half the total basket of prices. That is still at 6pc.Now, we don’t need to see it come all the way down to a sustainable level that is consistent with the target but we do need to see further progress.But I do want to give this message very strongly. We have had very encouraging, good news, so I think we can say ‘we’re on the way’.Here is a video the Governor released on X, formerly known as Twitter. I’m off now, but Alex Singleton will keep you up to speed from here.Governor Andrew Bailey explains today's decision to hold interest rates at 5.25%. pic.twitter.com/64ls7oS1OU— Bank of England (@bankofengland) March 21, 2024The US has filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that blocks competitors and stifles innovation.The Justice Department alleges that Apple has dominant power in the smartphone market and uses its control over the iPhone to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.”The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey and with 16 state attorneys general, is the first major competition action against the smartphone maker by the Biden administration.Apple called the lawsuit “wrong on the facts and the law” and said it “will vigorously defend against it.”President Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce competition laws.Apple shares have fallen 3.5pc today, wiping $86.8bn (£68.4bn) off the value of the world’s second largest company.The boss of Ryanair compared France’s finance minister to Donald Trump after he gave a “silly and ill-advised” criticism of plane maker Boeing.Michael O’Leary branded Bruno Le Maire a “stupid politician” after he said he hesitates to travel on Boeing aircraft because he values his life.Mr Le Maire drew laughter and applause from a conference audience this week when he said he preferred “the situation of Airbus to Boeing’s” following the midair blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight.He told the Europe 2024 conference in Berlin: “I now prefer flying in Airbus over Boeing — my family too, they care about me.”Mr O’Leary told Politico that Mr Le Maire’s words were “silly and ill-judged” but “we live in a world where we encourage free speech and Donald Trump is talking rubbish. So is Bruno Le Maire.”He said that his message to “some stupid politician going: ‘My family don’t feel safe on a [Boeing] 737,’ I say: ‘Well, then try flying on an Airbus with a problem with the engine that hasn’t been repaired.’”BAE Systems has won a multi-billion pound contract to build Australia’s next-generation nuclear-powered submarines in a major boost for British industry and jobs.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the details:As part of the Aukus defence pact with the UK and the US, the Australian government has chosen BAE alongside domestic defence company ASC Pty to deliver the vessels in the early 2040s.The SSN-Aukus subs will be used by both the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy and will be the “largest, most powerful and advanced” attack submarines Britain has ever deployed.They will be designed by BAE and feature British technology such as reactors developed by Rolls-Royce.Read what the investment means for UK industry.Wall Street stocks have extended their rally after the Federal Reserve indicated it aims to cut interest rates three times this year.Major indices added to records set Wednesday after the Fed issued its guidance as it held interest rates at two decade highs of 5.25pc to 5.5pc.The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 39,754.46, up 0.6 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6pc to 5,258.04.The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1pc to 16,527.13.Micron surged more than 15pc after reporting earnings that exceeded company projections and touting its future prospects.The company’s chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said.“We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI.”Social media company Reddit is poised to make its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange later after pricing at the high end of its range in an initial public offering.The Bank of England risks putting caution ahead of growth opportunities after keeping interest rates at their 16-year highs, according to analysts.Neil Shah, director at Edison Group, said the decision to keep rates at 5.25pc was “expected but nonetheless disappointing”. He said:Today’s decision underscores the Bank of England’s prioritisation of inflation management over immediate economic stimulus.It appears that, in the delicate balancing act between supporting recovery and curbing inflation, the Bank is choosing caution, potentially at the expense of growth opportunities.Looking ahead, it’s anticipated that the Bank of England will continue to tread cautiously, likely following the Fed’s lead, with expectations mounting for rate adjustments as early as June.The Bank of England “effectively signed off the Spring Budget” after saying it would have a minimal impact on inflation, economists have said.In the minutes of the MPC meeting, the Bank of England said Jeremy Hunt’s fiscal announcements earlier this month would add about a quarter of a percentage point to GDP “over the coming years”.It added: “As the measures will probably also boost potential supply to some extent, the implications for the output gap, and hence inflationary pressures in the economy, are likely to be smaller.”Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said: “The committee effectively signed off the Spring Budget by saying it would have a minimal impact on inflation since the measures boosted supply and demand.”Looking ahead, he added:On our forecasts, we think it will be clear by May that the economy is easing by enough to allow rates to start to come down.That suggests the first rate cut will come in May, or more likely June, and we think rates will eventually settle around 3.5pc in 2025.Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, accused the Bank of England of being “overly cautious” in the face of falling inflation. He said:While interest rates staying on hold again was expected, the more dovish vote split and meeting minutes suggest that rate setters are opening the door for rate cuts later this year.Though this interest rate hiking cycle is firmly in the rear-view mirror, the long delay between tightening policy and its impact on the wider economy means that the heavy toll of 14 rate rises has yet to fully crystalise.The Bank of England remains overly cautious on the prospect of rate cuts given the startling inflation slowdown and an economy in recession, increasing the risk they prolong our economic struggles by keeping policy too tight for too long.With inflation on track to drop back to the Bank’s 2% target in April, an interest rate cut by August looks a distinct possibility.Some commentators agree:The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged, despite the growing expectation that inflation will fall below target. First they failed to put up interest rates fast enough, now they're leaving them higher than necessary for longer than necessary.— Matthew Lesh (@matthewlesh) March 21, 2024Policymakers appear more open minded about the prospect of interest rate cuts, economists have said.The minutes from the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee said members would “consider the degree of restrictiveness of policy at each meeting”.The minutes said there “was a range of views... on the extent to which the risks from persistent inflationary pressures had receded”.The document went on:For all of these members, a further accumulation of evidence on inflation persistence would be required to warrant a shift in the monetary policy stance, with members differing on the extent of evidence that was likely to be needed.They would continue to consider the degree of restrictiveness of policy at each meeting.Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, said he considered this section a “key passage” about the committee’s intentions:Key passage in the BoE minutes. Explicitly stating that every upcoming meeting is live, and a range of views on weight of data needed to join Dhingra in voting for a cut. June now slightly more likely on my reading than August for the first cut. pic.twitter.com/XoGUZboiDh— Simon French (@Frencheconomics) March 21, 2024Analysts are lining up to declare that interest rates will be cut over the summer after the Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25pc - but some signalled policymakers will remain cautious amid high services inflation.Rob Clarry, investment strategist at Evelyn Partners said today’s change in voting patterns on the MPC “signals that we are getting closer to a first interest rate cut”.He added: “We continue to expect this will materialise around the middle of the year as inflation decelerates to the 2pc.”Andrew Jones of Janus Henderson Investors said: “As it seems very likely that inflation will continue to move downwards over the next few months, we would still expect to see interest rate cuts in the middle of the year.”Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, signalled caution. He said:Where inflation ultimately settles depends on services inflation. At 6.1pc, that’s too high for the Bank to cut rates now, even if headline CPI is down to 3.4pc.Wages will be a key driver of services inflation - but the Bank has itself flagged the difficulty of assessing labour market conditions without more reliable data, so we think it will be extremely cautious before declaring victory in its inflation fight.We do think it will start to cut later this year, but expect policy to remain tight in 2024.Money markets are putting the chance of a first interest rate cut by the Bank of England in June at more than 50pc.It comes after no members of its Monetary Policy Committee voted for an increase in interest rates.The FTSE 100 has surged after the Bank of England pivoted towards interest rate cuts as it held borrowing costs at 5.25pc.Britain’s flagship stock market jumped 1.5pc after the latest decision by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave borrowing costs unchanged for a fifth consecutive meeting.For the first time since September 2021, no-one on the nine-member committee voted for an increase in borrowing costs. One member voted for a cut in an 8-1 split.Meanwhile, the Governor Andrew Bailey signalled cuts could be on the way as he said “things are moving in the right direction”.The pound dropped as much as 0.4pc against the dollar and UK bonds rallied as traders pounced on the signal that the MPC is shifting towards rate cuts.Money markets have priced in three quarter of a percentage point reductions in borrowing costs by the end of the year and put the chances of a first rate cut in June at about 80pc.The Bank of England maintained borrowing costs at 16-year highs despite inflation falling last month to 3.4pc following its steepest drop since 1978.Some economists think inflation will have fallen to the Bank of England’s 2pc target by April.In its statement alongside its decision to hold interest rates steady, the Bank of England said:Monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2pc target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC’s remit.The committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2pc target dissipates.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said:In recent weeks we’ve seen further encouraging signs that inflation is coming down.We’ve held rates again today at 5.25pc because we need to be sure that inflation will fall back to our 2pc target and stay there.We’re not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction.The pound fell a little further after the Bank of England held interest rates steady.Sterling was last down 0.4pc against the dollar at $1.27 and down 0.3pc against the euro at 85p.For the first time since September 2021, no member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rate rise.Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann both voted for holds, having been the last members to keep pushing for a rate rise to 5.5pc.Swati Dhingra voted for a cut, leaving the MPC in a three-way split for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008.The Bank of England has kept interest rates steady at 5.25pc for a fifth time in a row as it battles to bring down inflation.Policymakers maintained borrowing costs at 16-year highs despite inflation falling last month to 3.4pc following its steepest drop since 1978.Some economists think inflation will have fallen to the Bank of England’s 2pc target by April.The US Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged at two-decade highs on Wednesday but triggered a surge in stock markets after reaffirming its aim to cut borrowing costs three times this year.Earlier today the Swiss National Bank shocked markets after announcing a surprise interest rate cut to 1.5pc - becoming the first major central bank to cut rates since the pandemic.Not long now... a quick reminder of where we are:The Bank of England is expected to announce it will hold interest rates steady at 5.25pc for a fifth time in a row.Policymakers will announce at noon the result of their meeting, at which they are likely to maintain borrowing costs at 16-year highs as they battle to bring down inflation.However, the Bank is coming under growing scrutiny over its stance after the consumer prices index - which measures the rate that prices are rising - fell at its sharpest pace since 1978 last month to 3.4pc.Some economists think inflation will have fallen to the Bank of England’s 2pc target by April.The pound has slipped ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate announcement, which is due at noon.Sterling has dropped 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.27 and has fallen 0.2pc against the euro to 85p.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, which decides interest rates, was divided the last time it met.Two MPC members, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann, continued to vote for rates to rise to 5.5pc, while Swati Dhingra voted for a cut, leaving the MPC in a three-way split for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008.Economists are divided on whether that will be the case this timeI am not sure data over the last six weeks is sufficient to change the view of 3-way split committee. There is something for everyone (hawks point to oil/ GDP & retail sales rebound; doves to further gas declines/becalmed trade/housing). I'd expect voting split to remain the same— Simon French (@Frencheconomics) March 21, 2024The Bank of England will surely leave rates on hold at noon today, but still some hopes of...1. a shift in the voting split (it's hard to see how there could still be two votes for a hike, and only one for a cut!)and2. a more dovish statement (any hint at an easing bias?)— Julian Jessop (@julianHjessop) March 21, 2024While the UK, US and eurozone are focused on when the first interest rate cuts will take place, Turkey is at an altogether different stage in its fight against inflation.Its central bank has ramped up interest rates by five full percentage points from 45pc to 50pc in a surprise move ahead of local elections.It comes as inflation in the country is on track to exceed 70pc.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that central banks around the world face growing political pressure to cut interest rates but policymakers need to maintain their independence.IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that central banks with stronger independence scores are more successful in controlling inflation and keeping inflation expectations in check.Her warnings come ahead of a likely general election in Britain this year, as well as the US presidential elections and several others in major economies.In a blog on the IMF website, she said:Calls are growing for interest rate cuts, even if premature, and are likely to intensify as half the world’s population votes this year.Risks of political interference in banks’ decision-making and personnel appointments are rising. Governments and central bankers must resist these pressures.She said that central bankers’ success in preventing a global financial meltdown during the pandemic was quickly followed by monetary tightening to bring down inflation. Both efforts were a function of their independence and the credibility that goes along with that.By contrast, Georgieva said that during the high inflation period of the 1970s, central banks did not have clear mandates to prioritise price stability, nor clear laws protecting their autonomy, and as a result, they were often pressured by politicians to cut interest rates.UK bonds rallied after the private sector grew for a fifth month in a row in a sign that Britain is pulling out of its recession.The yield on 10-year gilts - which moves inversely to its price - has fallen more than four basis points to 3.97pc.It comes after PMI data showed more solid growth in Britain’s services sector, while the debt market was also boosted by the US Federal Reserve’s forecast that it will cut interest rates three times this year.Ben & Jerry’s has vowed to continue with its controversial social activism under new ownership, as parent company Unilever prepares to spin off the ice cream business.Our employment editor Lucy Burton has the details:The brand’s independent board insisted that it would not stop campaigning on issues such as social justice and climate change, regardless of who controls it.Directors said that their independence is protected by a merger agreement dating back to its takeover by Unilever in 2000.In a statement to the Telegraph, the board said that this agreement exists “in perpetuity regardless of ownership structure”.Read how the vow to continue activism is likely to pose a headache to Unilever.Money markets think the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold today for a fifth consecutive meeting but the timing of its first reduction in borrowing costs has become the subject of debate.Traders have fully priced in a quarter of a percentage point rate reduction from 5.25pc to 5pc by August.However, the possibility of a June cut has been brought into play after the sharp decline of inflation to 3.4pc last month and the Fed’s forecast that it will reduce rates three times this year.Traders think there is a roughly 60pc chance of a quarter of a percentage point drop in UK interest rates in June.Henk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said:The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to be laser-focused on the incoming inflation prints, labour market reports and growth figures for the first quarter.These could pave the way for a pivot to an easing stance by the May meeting, with the first 25bp rate cut pencilled in for June.With more to follow, we anticipate that the Bank Rate will finish the year at 4pc.The FTSE 100 has led a rally in European stock today following indications from the Federal Reserve that it expects to deliver three interest rate cuts later this year.France’s CAC 40 rose as much as 0.8pc, while Germany’s DAX gained as much as 0.9pc to 18,159.77.The FTSE 100 was last up 0.9pc having gained as much as 1.3pc.US shares are expected to drift higher when markets open later, having hit record highs on Wednesday.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2pcto finish at a record high 40,815.66 after the government reported exports grew nearly 8pc in February from a year earlier, in the third straight month of increase.Britain’s private sector expanded for a fifth month in a row in a further sign that the economy is moving out of recession, according to a key survey.The S&P Global Flash UK PMI registered 52.9 in March, down fractionally from 53 in February but above the crucial 50 mark which separates contraction from growth.Service sector growth was quicker than that seen in the manufacturing sector. However, it lost some momentum in March, coming in at a three-month low of 53.4.The sector is a key focus for policymakers at the Bank of England, who fear it could keep inflation persistent. Services inflation remained strong at 6.1pc in February, according to the Office for National Statistics.Meanwhile, manufacturing production increased for the first time since February last year, albeit only fractionally. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global said:Further signs of the UK economy having pulled out of last year’s brief recession are provided by the provisional PMI data for March.A further robust expansion of business activity ended the economy’s best quarter since the second quarter of last year.The survey data are indicative of first quarter GDP rising 0.25pc to thereby signal a reassuringly solid rebound from the technical recession seen in the second half of 2023.Flash #PMI signals a solid end to the first quarter for the UK economy, indicates 0.25% Q1 #GDP rise. But price pressures have remained elevated, especially in the service sector., which will worry the #BoE.

The figure still indicates a contraction but was a whisker away from the 50 mark which would have indicated growth.New orders fell at the slowest rate for ten months and backlogs of work were depleted at the weakest rate for ninemonths. Meanwhile, order books fell at a reduced rate and business confidence about the year ahead improved to a 13-month high.However, manufacturing output fell across the eurozone for a twelfth successive month in MarchDr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:If you were hoping for a recovery in the manufacturing sector in the first quarter, it’s time to throw in the towel.The March PMI confirmed the clear weakness of this sector, which seems to be dominated by the heavyweight Germany.Output fell at more or less the same pace as in the first two months of the year, and new orders continued their downward trend unabated.Interest rates have remained unchanged in Norway, as expected, but policymakers said borrowing costs could be reduced “earlier than envisaged”.Norges Bank left its benchmark rate at 4.5pc but said it thinks it will be “gradually moving down” by the autumn.The Norwegian krone gained 0.3pc against the euro following the decision.The Swiss National Bank has announced a surprise interest rate cut in a sign the global economy is turning a corner.In a decision which wrongfooted markets, the central bank reduced borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.5pc.It is the first reduction for one of the G10 group of the world’s most traded currencies since the end of the pandemic.The Swiss franc tumbled 1.1pc against the pound and as much as 1.2pc against the dollar.UK stock markets opened higher as investors welcomed the Federal Reserve sticking to its outlook that it will cut interest rates three times this year.The internationally-focused FTSE 100 was up 1.3pc to its highest since May. The domestically-oriented FTSE 250 was up 1.1pc.The Fed kept borrowing costs unchanged on Wednesday and projected as many as three interest rate cuts this year, soothing investors’ nerves about high interest rates and sending US stocks to close higher.Interest rate-sensitive real estate investment trusts and precious metal miners were among the biggest gainers this morning, up 1.6pc and 3.3pc respectively.The Bank of England will announce its next interest rate decision at noon.Among stocks, M&G added 3.5pc after the British insurer and asset manager reported profit ahead of analyst forecasts for 2023.Next surged to the top of the FTSE 100 as its shares hit an all-time high as it gave an optimistic outlook for the year ahead and reported record profits.Next shares have surged to a record high as the retailer predicted profits would hit £960m this year.The high street giant’s share price rose 5.2pc to 8,950p, valuing the company at £11.3bn.Charlie Huggins of Wealth Club said Next had revealed “another excellent set of results” as profits increased by 5pc to a record £918m.He said: “Shrewd acquisitions and investments have improved its growth prospects, while moderating inflation has significantly reduced pressure on costs. And while the UK economy isn’t out of the woods, the economic tea leaves don’t read as grimly as at this stage last year.”Adam Vettese, analyst at investment platform eToro, said:We’ve heard of many retailers having to contend with disruption to shipping due to geopolitical tension but Next has said this will not be a significant factor.This is good news for shareholders but more importantly Next will continue to funnel cash back to them in the form of dividends and share buybacks as they have done consistently in recent years.The pound has steadied against the dollar ahead of the Bank of England’s meeting where it is expected to keep interest rates on hold.Sterling was last unchanged on the day at $1.2788.

The company also has control over UK fashion house Reiss.Gora Suri, economist at PwC UK, said the latest borrowing figures show the Chancellor remains on track to meet his fiscal rule of getting debt falling as a percentage of GDP within five years.He said:We expect disinflationary pressures to build in the next few months.This bodes well for further reductions in government interest payments, which are heavily influenced by the impact of RPI movements on lagged index-linked gilts.Through a selection of tax rises and tax cuts, the Chancellor has managed to remain on track to meet his main fiscal rule to get debt as a share of GDP falling in five years time, albeit marginally.The latest Budget has highlighted how a challenging economic backdrop continues to constrain the domestic policy agenda.This government and the next will face a herculean task to both stimulate a flatlining economy and keep the public finances on a sustainable footing.In corporate news, Nationwide Building Society is poised to take over smaller rival Virgin Money after the pair agreed a deal worth around £2.9bn.Nationwide has made a 220p-a-share firm offer for Virgin Money, including a planned 2p-per-share dividend payout, which will now be voted on by Virgin Money’s shareholders.Confirmation of the deal comes after the two companies reached a preliminary agreement earlier this month, with Nationwide having spent the past two weeks looking through Virgin Money’s books before making the firm offer.Nationwide said: “Nationwide’s board agreed that a binding offer to acquire Virgin Money was in the best interests of the society and its present and future members, following full consideration and the appropriate due diligence, and after taking comments from members into account.”The planned takeover will bring together Britain’s fifth and sixth largest retail lenders, creating a combined group with around 24.5m customers, more than 25,000 staff and nearly 700 branches.But the move will spell the end of the Virgin Money brand, with Nationwide planning to rebrand the Virgin Money business as Nationwide within six years, although it will keep the two brands initially.The disappointing borrowing figures mean the Treasury is likely to exceed official forecasts for total expenditure this year set by the Office for Budget Responsibility, according to economists.February’s public sector net borrowing, excluding banking groups, hit £8.4bn last month, which was above forecasts of £6bn.Total tax receipts were £7.2bn higher than in February last year but total expenditure of £89.6bn came in £2.9bn higher than a year ago.With only one month of this fiscal year still to go, cumulative borrowing hit £106.8bn.Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:This means that borrowing in March will have to come in at just £7.2bn for the OBR’s full-year forecast of £114bn to be met.Given that borrowing last March was £16.9bn, that seems very unlikely.That said, we still expect borrowing to fall more quickly beyond 2025/26 than the OBR expects.This may mean the government squeezes in another pre-election giveaway in a fiscal event later this year.But a fiscal tightening will probably still be required beyond 2024. So anything the Chancellor gives away will probably be taken away once the election is over.The chart shows how public sector net debt has risen to its highest levels in six decades following the global financial crisis and the pandemic:Debt is often presented as a % of GDP. This ratio compares debt to the value output of the whole UK economy over a 12-month period. Having peaked at 99.2% of GDP in September and October 2020, the debt ratio at the end of February 2024 was 97.1 %.https://t.co/s3hETwkuJK pic.twitter.com/06zFyjNNBl— Fraser Munro (@Fraser_ONS_PSF) March 21, 2024Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said:It was right that this Government provided billions pounds to support individuals and businesses during Covid, and pay half of people’s energy bills after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

2024-03-21 18:35:06+00:00,"DOJ says Apple's 'complete control' over tap-to-pay transactions stops innovation, cements its monopoly","In its wide-ranging antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business, the U.S. Justice Department takes specific aim against Apple's massive financial business, specifically how it uses Apple Pay to prohibit competition and make large amounts of money in the process, to the tune of billions in annual revenues.The DOJ alleges that is not only stifling competition among payment services, but it is potentially stifling innovation, since the fees that banks and others fork out to play with Apple Pay amount to them being less inclined to develop other kinds of services that might rival Apple in any way.Apple Pay is no stranger to regulatory controversy. In 2020, the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation into it. And in January 2024, perhaps with a sober regard of the other looming regulatory battles it would be facing this year, Apple finally offered some concessions, where it would allow third parties access to its NFC and related technology to build their own tap-to-pay payment services to bypass Apple Wallet and Apple Pay. (Apple's offer is still being evaluated.)Interestingly, although Europe has been a hotbed for Apple antitrust action -- just earlier this month it was fined almost $2 billion for breaching antitrust rules in music streaming -- that Apple Pay case was the only mention of European activity in the nearly 90-page DOJ complaint.PayPal -- the payments behemoth that has substantial businesses in mobile transactions and point-of-sale technology -- was apparently instrumental in the original EU complaint around Apple's payment monopoly. Contacted today about the DOJ compaint in the U.S., a spokesperson for PayPal said the company declined to comment. (It's certainly keeping a close eye on the proceedings.)Apple today takes a 0.15% fee on any transaction made via Apple Pay. In 2021, that worked out to $1 billion; by 2022, that grew to $1.9 billion, and in 2023, it's estimated that the figure more than doubled to $4 billion.These are, relatively speaking, small sums for the company considering that it made more than $383 billion in 2023 in revenues overall.But Apple's longer-term bet is that payments are central to how people exist in today's world -- ""Apple recognizes that paying for products and services with a digital wallet will eventually become 'something people do every day of their lives,'"" as the DOJ notes -- and thus central to the iPhone ecosystem, iPhone ownership and ubiquity, and the DOJ's complaint.Core to the DOJ's focus is the fact that today, Apple maintains ""complete control"" over how users make tap-to-pay payments using the NFC functionality of their iPhones in the U.S.Its contention is that this has not only prohibited other companies from building tap-to-pay functions in third-party mobile wallets, but also has hindered what is done with the technology. ""Absent Apple’s conduct, cross-platform digital wallets could also be used to manage and pay for subscriptions and in-app purchases,"" the DOJ alleges.Also of concern is the fact that Apple Wallet holds all the cards, literally and figuratively, and it can effectively become a super app that provides much more than just financial functionality (something else that Apple has prohibited from developing on iOS, the DOJ points out elsewhere in its complaint). ""Apple envisions that Apple Wallet will ultimately supplant multiple functions of physical wallets to become a single app for shopping, digital keys, transit, identification, travel, entertainment, and more.""At the heart of Apple's protection of payment functionality is its ability to ""own"" all the customer data that comes with it. That is something that the DOJ has identified and tied in with how Apple's playbook is ultimately about selling its smartphones.""If third-party developers could create cross-platform wallets, users transitioning away from the iPhone could continue to use the same wallet, with the same cards, IDs, payment histories, peer-to-peer payment contacts, and other information, making it easier to switch smartphones.""And because many users already use apps created by their preferred financial institutions, if these financial institutions offered digital wallets, then users would have access to new apps and technologies without needing to share their private financial data with additional third parties, including Apple,"" it writes. ""In the short term, these improved features would make the iPhone more attractive to users and profitable for Apple. Accordingly, the absence of cross-platform digital wallets with tap-to-pay capability on the iPhone makes it harder for iPhone users to purchase a different smartphone.""For now, it's a one-sided development direction: Apple does encourage banks, payment companies like PayPal, merchants and others that build payment-related businesses to incorporate Apple Pay functionality into their own workflow, but for these it's about encouraging transactions on Apple Pay by enabling credit cards to be added to the Wallet, or about incorporating payment facilities into payment apps to take payments -- more transaction revenue for Apple! -- but not to build their own payment features.""Apple simultaneously exerts its smartphone monopoly to block these same partners from developing better payment products and services for iPhone users,"" it notes. In the meantime, Apple has continued to develop Apple Pay, launching -- for example -- its own buy now, pay later offering last autumn (pictured above).The DOJ may have its own major beef with Google, but ironically it comes out a bit of a hero in this complaint. Both Samsung and the Android giant are called out as two examples payment app developers that are not taking fees on transactions made using their payment apps.""Apple’s fees are a significant expense for issuing banks and cut into funding for features and benefits that banks might otherwise offer smartphone users,"" it notes.Apple's counterclaim is likely to be that Apple Pay has removed a significant piece of friction in the purchasing cycle, which actually creates more transactions overall, not less.That might well be true but not as Apple would frame it. Apple Pay and Apple Wallet are both a small part of Apple's services revenues -- which were upwards of $90 billion in 2023 -- or indeed overall revenues. But the DOJ cites estimates from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that say Apple Pay enabled nearly $200 billion in transactions in the United States in 2022, with that figure expected to grow to $458 billion by 2028.That alone speaks to just how central it is and will impact the wider ecosystem, one more reason the DOJ feels it supports its case to call it out now.For more on Apple’s antitrust lawsuit, check here: Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsDOJ claims green bubbles are an issue in Apple iPhone antitrust lawsuitWhy Apple’s antitrust lawsuit could be a silver lining for Epic GamesApple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopoly Epic, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group and others applaud DOJ’s Apple lawsuitDOJ calls out Apple for breaking iMessage-on-Android solution, BeeperHere’s what the DOJ suit could mean for Apple WatchApple slams DOJ case as misguided attempt to turn iPhone into AndroidThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-pay-doj-iphone-monopoly/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/doj-says-apples-complete-control-183506492.html
2024-03-21 18:23:45+00:00,"Justice Department sues Apple, alleging it illegally monopolized the smartphone market","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors, stifles innovation and keeps prices artificially high.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone market and leverages control over the iPhone to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.”“Apple has locked its consumers into the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Stalling the advancement of the very market it revolutionized, she said, it has ""smothered an entire industry.”Apple called the lawsuit “wrong on the facts and the law” and said it “will vigorously defend against it.”The sweeping action takes aim at how Apple molds its technology and business relationships to “extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others.""That includes diminishing the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, limiting access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets and refusing to allow its iMessage app to exchange encrypted messaging with competing platforms.It specifically seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps -- in areas including streaming, messaging and digital payments -- and prevent it from continuing to craft contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that let it “obtain, maintain, extend or entrench a monopoly.”The lawsuit — filed with 16 state attorneys general — is just the latest example aggressive antitrust law enforcement by a Justice Department that has also taken on Amazon, Google and other tech giants with the stated aim of making the digital universe more fair, innovative and competitive.“The Department of Justice has an enduring legacy taking on the biggest and toughest monopolies in history,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. ""Today we stand here once again to promote competition and innovation for next generation of technology.”Antitrust researcher Dina Srinavasan, a Yale University fellow, compared the lawsuit's significance to the government's action against Microsoft a quarter century ago — in picking a ""tremendous fight” with what has been the world's most prosperous company.“It’s a really big deal to go up and punch someone who is acting like a bully and pretending not to be a bully,” she said.President Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce antitrust statutes. While its stepped-up policing of corporate mergers and questionable business practices has met resistance from some business leaders — accusing the Democratic administration of overreach — it’s been lauded by others as long overdue.The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has assiduously built around the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch to create what is often referred to as a “walled garden” so its meticulously designed hardware and software can seamlessly flourish together while requiring consumers to do little more than turn the devices on.The strategy has helped Apple attain annual revenue of nearly $400 billion and, until recently, a market value of more than $3 trillion. But Apple’s shares have fallen by 7% this year even as most of the stock market has climbed to new highs, resulting in long-time rival Microsoft to seize the mantle as the world’s most valuable company.Apple said the lawsuit, if successful, would “hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect” and would ""set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.Apple has defended the walled garden as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has described the barrier as a way for the iPhone to distinguish itself from devices running on Google’s Android software, which isn’t as restrictive and is licensed to a wide range of manufacturers.“Apple claims to be a champion of protecting user data, but its app store fee structure and partnership with Google search erode privacy,” Consumer Reports senior researcher Sumit Sharma said in a statement.The lawsuit complains that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and that the high margins it earns on each is more than double what others in the industry get. And when users run an internet search, Google gives Apple a “significant cut” of the advertising revenue those searches generate.The company’s app store also charges developers up to 30 percent of the app’s price for consumers.Critics of Apple’s anticompetitive practices have long complained that it’s claim to prioritize user privacy is hypocritical when profits are at stake. While its iMessage services is sheathed from prying eyes by end-to-end encryption, that protection evaporates the moment someone texts a non-Apple device.But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert, said that while he believes Apple needs reigning in, he is concerned that the Justice Department’s focus on messaging may be misplaced and could weaken security and privacy.“I am quite glad that access to SMS messages is restricted,” said Strafach, creator of the Guardian Firewall app.He notes that a number of apps, ostensibly for weather and news, on iPhones have secretly and persistently sent users' GPS data to third parties. Strafach said he is concerned weakened Apple security ""could open the door to stalkerware/spouseware, which is already more difficult to install on Apple devices compared to Android.”However, prominent critic Cory Doctorow has complained that while Apple has blocked entities like Facebook from spying on its users it runs its “own surveillance advertising empire” that gathers the same kinds of personal data but for its own use.Fears about an antitrust crackdown on Apple’s business model haven't just contributed to the drop in the company’s stock price. There is also concerns it lags Microsoft and Google in the push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence technology.Antitrust regulators made it clear in their complaint that they see Apple's walled garden mostly as a weapon to ward off competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices that have propelled its lofty profit margins while stifling innovation.“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland. Left unchallenged, Apple would ""only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” he added.With the attempt to rein in Apple's dominance, the Biden administration is escalating an antitrust siege that has already triggered lawsuits against Google and Amazon accusing them in engaging in illegal tactics to thwart competition, as well as unsuccessful attempts to block acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook.Apple's business interests are also entangled in the Justice Department's case against Google, which went to trial last fall and is headed toward final arguments scheduled to begin May 1 in Washington, D.C. In that case, regulators are alleging Google has stymied competition by paying for the rights for its already dominant online search engine to be the automatic place to handle queries on the iPhone and a variety of web browsers in an arrangement that generates an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually.Now that the Justice Department is mounting a direct attack across its business, Apple stands to lose even more.___Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-kept-illegal-monopoly-over-143222010.html

2024-03-21 18:04:20+00:00,How Europe's regulatory battle with Apple could signal what’s to come for American consumers,"LONDON (AP) — It'll likely take years before the U.S. government's massive antitrust lawsuit against Apple is resolved — but the iPhone maker's troubles with European regulators offer a glimpse of what changes American customers may see down the line.The U.S. lawsuit seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps in areas such as streaming, messaging and digital payments. The Department of Justice also wants to prevent the tech giant from building language into its contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that lets it obtain or keep a monopoly.These are similar to themes that the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, and Apple have been wrangling over for years.EU antitrust watchdogs have launched multiple antitrust cases accusing Apple of violating the 27-nation bloc's competition laws, while also imposing tough digital rules aimed at stopping tech companies from cornering digital markets.Brussels' efforts will soon start to have an impact on the way the company does business and the experience iPhone users have in Europe.

2024-03-21 18:04:20+00:00,Apple's regulatory battles in Europe foreshadow what changes US antitrust suit may bring for users,"LONDON (AP) — It'll likely take years before the U.S. government's massive antitrust lawsuit against Apple is resolved — but the iPhone maker's troubles with European regulators offer a glimpse of what changes American customers may see down the line.The U.S. lawsuit seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps in areas such as streaming, messaging and digital payments. The Department of Justice also wants to prevent the tech giant from building language into its contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that lets obtain or keep a monopoly.These are similar to themes that the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, and Apple have been wrangling over for years.EU antitrust watchdogs have launched multiple antitrust cases accusing Apple of violating the 27-nation bloc's competition laws, while also imposing tough digital rules aimed at stopping tech companies from cornering digital markets.Brussels' efforts will soon start to have an impact on the way the company does business and the experience iPhone users have in Europe. And the changes could signal what's to come for U.S. Apple users — if the Justice Department has its way, at least.Here's a closer look:MUSIC STREAMINGMusic streaming users typically weren't able to pay for their Spotify subscriptions directly through their iPhone apps.

2024-03-21 17:51:05+00:00,Justice Department files antitrust suit against Apple,"The US Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.Apple ""has maintained its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference Thursday.Apple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""A victory for the US in this case ""would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,"" Apple added in its statement.Apple's stock was down more than 4% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.The filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.The Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws.The new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.The DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.The Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start to 2024.Shares of Apple are down 7% year-to-date, as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title of the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).At the center of the DOJ’s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple’s most recognizable product.The company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.That includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.Garland, for example, characterized Apple’s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user’s response is in green rather than blue.That, he said, ""limits functionality."" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.He then quoted Apple’s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn’t send his mom certain videos: ""'Buy your mom IPhone.'""Apple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple iWatch from working with Android smartphones, while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival’s smartwatch.""Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kantor, ""by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.""Apple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called ""super apps,"" which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.The wide-ranging suit is ""about the core unfair practices of Apple,"" Case Western Reserve antitrust expert and law professor Anat Elon-Beck said.""Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers and, in my opinion, its shareholders.""As a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will ""see more downward movement.""This is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.The last was in 2020, when ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps —as opposed to using Apple's payment service.Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple’s App Store — the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, and, generally, charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.Apple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.Both companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.Following that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called ""anticompetitive.""Apple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the E.U.'s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.Apple said it will address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a 50-euro cent fee for each download if they cross the 1 million download market in a year.Both Epic and Spotify, however, objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule ""hostile.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-21 17:06:11+00:00,Is the Apple antitrust suit a silver lining for Epic Games?,"The Department of Justice and seventeen state attorneys general filed a massive lawsuit against Apple on Thursday morning, accusing the company of monopolistic smartphone practices. Meanwhile, Fortnite maker Epic Games has been accusing Apple’s iOS App Store of antitrust violations for years in an ongoing, arduous legal battle.Epic is never named explicitly in the 88-page lawsuit, but the gaming company’s complaints are echoed across extensive discussion of the App Store’s anticompetitive practices.“Apple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily,” the suit says. “And it frequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple’s monopoly power.”Epic’s core complaint about the App Store is that developers must cede 30% of in-app purchases to Apple. And unlike Android devices, iPhones do not allow for sideloading apps, meaning that Apple has control over any app in its App Store. For almost a decade, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been a staunch critic of the revenue cut, which he thinks is monopolistic and predatory toward smaller companies. In 2020, Epic made it possible for Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, rather than giving a cut to Apple – then, Apple removed Epic from the App Store, and now, four years later, we’re still watching the two companies duke it out in various legal proceedings.While a judge ruled at the time that Apple can’t prevent apps from routing users to alternative payment methods, the iPhone maker was ultimately not deemed a monopoly.Given past rulings in Apple’s favor, it’s surprising that this lawsuit is aligned with some of Epic’s grievances.“While Apple has reduced the tax it collects from a subset of developers, Apple still extracts 30 percent from many app makers,” the suit says. “Apple also generates substantial and increasing revenue by charging developers to help users find their apps in the App Store—something that, for years, Apple told developers was part of the reason they paid a 30 percent tax in the first place.”Epic isn’t the only large company that has faced off against Apple. In January, as developers prepared for the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) to take effect, Spotify also stepped into the ring, calling Apple’s compliance plan “extortion” and a “complete and total farce.” Then in March, Apple was fined €1.84 billion for breaching antitrust rules in the market for music streaming services.On Thursday, the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF) – which includes Epic Games, Spotify, Deezer, Proton and other companies – released a statement in favor of the DOJ’s action against Apple.""With today's announcement, the Department of Justice is taking a strong stand against Apple’s stranglehold over the mobile app ecosystem, which stifles competition and hurts American consumers and developers alike,” said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the CAF. ""The DOJ complaint details Apple’s long history of illegal conduct – abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition. The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple’s abusive behavior and are working to address it.""Epic Games declined TechCrunch’s request to comment. Sweeney, who is usually vocal about these issues, has also been reticent on the matter.“I’ll be off Twitter antitrust commentary between now and the end of my testimony in the Australian Epic v Apple and Google trial in Melbourne,” Sweeney posted, alongside a photo he took in Melbourne.Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-antitrust-epic-games/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-antitrust-suit-silver-lining-170611780.html

He points out that when Americans buy a smartphone, they have ""two clear choices"": Apple and Android devices, disbarring any assumptions of a monopoly. He notes as this legal battle continues, Apple's innovation efforts may be impacted ""out of fear"" of being accused of monopolistic practices.Szabo notes that as long as Apple can provide evidence that supports ""business purposes for what they are doing,"" the courts will most likely rule in their favor. He suggests that many of the concerns raised by the DOJ can be ""easily dismissed"" due to the legitimate purposes they serve in relation to Apple products like security prevention and payment processing.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithRACHELLE AKUFFO: The DOJ accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Now this is the culmination of a five-year probe into one of the world's most valuable technology companies. Joining me now on this is Carl Szabo, NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel.Thank you for joining me this morning. So as we heard there, the Attorney General laying out the grounds for this antitrust lawsuit. What are the key takeaways that we need to keep in mind at the beginning of this?CARL SZABO: Yeah. So this is a really long process. And what we've seen in similar efforts by the Biden administration's Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, when it comes to antitrust, is a kind of Hail Mary pass when it comes to antitrust law. What you heard from the AG was a lot of declarations of monopoly, or declarations of bad business practice when, in fact, we as Americans know that actually, if we want to go buy a device, we actually have two clear choices. We have Apple, and we have Android.So already, the argument that there's a quote, monopoly, on smartphones just doesn't even make sense to the average American. But this will be a really long process. And kind of the process is the pain for a lot of these businesses because as it goes on, Apple will continue to move away from innovation, creating new services and new features for our phones out of fear that this will be then used against them by the Department of Justice as part of this frivolous lawsuit.One of the other important components of this is you didn't hear any real claims of consumer harm. They said consumers are being harmed. But they didn't actually go in to explain how. How are consumers being harmed, because there's really no evidence of consumer harm.What you have seen is devices continue to get better and better. And that is evidence of a clear competitive and functioning marketplace. So the Department of Justice has a real uphill climb when it comes to the courts. Just saying somebody is something doesn't make it so.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Carl, to your point, though, the focus did seem to be on the exclusionary conduct. So not just for certain users. They mentioned, you know, Android users with the green bubble. Some of that cross-platform messaging becoming difficult. And that they were purposely sort of degrading, or limiting, the functionality there. How high of a barrier is that to try and cover, if you're Apple, to really combat that argument?CARL SZABO: Yeah. So essentially, as long as Apple can show compelling business purposes for what they are doing-- the courts have typically gone on the side of businesses. So Apple will say, look, the reason we don't allow you to install your own apps is because we know the security problems. And one of the reasons why people like Apple ecosystem is because they know their devices are safe and secure.Just think about your laptop, computer, where we're constantly worrying about installing malware or spyware. That doesn't really happen on iPhones. And that's because of the closed ecosystem.With respect to payment processing, one of the reasons why it is typically only been allowed through Apple is because as a parent, for example, I get an alert every time my kid tries to make an in-app purchase. If we allowed other payment processors, I wouldn't have such a recourse on my device. So a lot of the complaints that you're hearing are easily dismissed by Apple because of the security and consumer benefits that are being used to offset whatever claims that a business has.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Carl, just quickly. They also mentioned that 30% commission, when it comes to developers who want to be on the App Store. How strong is that argument?CARL SZABO: So this is a little bit of the legal jujitsu that the Department of Justice is trying to do. I actually read their complaint. They claim that it can be up to 30%. But in reality, an overwhelming majority of apps pay $0.00, 0%, to be hosted on the App Store.In fact, it is only the largest of corporations that even begin to pay a 30% commission, or service, for being hosted on the App Store. And that's the same service fee that Microsoft charges on the Xbox. And seemingly, the Department of Justice hasn't weighed in on that as anti-competitive.So what you're seeing is kind of the use of a big number that applies to only a small fraction of big corporations being used to try to explain the entire ecosystem. And that's just not what's happening. Most apps pay $0 on the App Store. And many apps can actually pay $0 even if they're big. Netflix, for example, will not let you sign up through their app. And in fact, Netflix does not pay a single cent to Apple for being hosted on their service.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well certainly, some important context added there.

2024-03-21 16:52:00+00:00,DOJ Takes a Bite out of Apple as Buffett Sours on the Stock,"Apple: One of America’s Great CompaniesZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple (AAPL) stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.Chinks in the Armor?Today, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a “free market” person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.Relative WeaknessWeakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank (NYCB) was underperforming – a subtle clue of the damage to come.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBear Flag PatternAAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume – a bearish sign.Image Source: TradingViewLack of Innovation Apple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the “wow” factor in new iPhone releases.Buffett Souring on AAPL Shares?Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire’s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.Bottom LineFlat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""A victory for the US in this case ""would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,"" Apple added in its statement.Apple's stock was down roughly 3% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.Well that's all we have time for, thanks for following along.

It is an outrage that 100,000 more children are in poverty – they are being forgotten.“These shocking figures should be an urgent wake-up call to all of us, especially the UK Government. We cannot go on like this. There is no reason children should be going without food, heating, toys, or beds.""Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says workers need lower borrowing costs:“It seems that the Bank of England is flatly refusing to recognise the economic reality on the ground. We won’t see a sustainable recovery until workers and their families have some respite from the high interest rates strangling demand throughout the economy.""Workers won’t pay the price for recent years’ sky-high inflation driven by widespread profiteering across the economy.”Read more: When will interest rates fall and what should you do?Easter eggs from brands including Maltesers, Lindt and Cadbury cost at least 50% more than they did a year ago, while others have shrunk in size, a new study has shown.The overall price of chocolate has increased by 12.6% in a year – significantly more than the 5.6% rise seen on supermarket food and drink generally – after dry weather in West Africa led to a spike in global cocoa prices, according to the Which? supermarket food and drink inflation tracker.In the steepest example of Easter egg inflation, a 286g Maltesers Truffles Luxury Easter Egg increased from £8 to £13 at Waitrose in the month to the end of February compared with the same time a year ago – an increase of 62.5%.At Asda, a 50g Lindt Gold Bunny Milk Chocolate five pack increased from an average £2 to £3.11 – up 55.6%.At Tesco, a 250g Ferrero Rocher Golden Easter Egg rose in price from £10 on average in the month to the end of February last year to £15 on average in the same period this year – an increase of 50%.Which? also found that at Ocado, a 1kg Cadbury Mini Eggs Large Pouch cost £8.86 on average last February but £12.95 this year, up 46.2%.At Sainsbury’s, a Kinder Easter with Surprise 36g rose in price from £1.50 on average to £2, or a 33.3% increase.Which? did not include loyalty card prices or multibuys in its analysis.The latest research from American Express has found that the average UK family will spend £3,045 entertaining children during the school holidays in 2024.Some 43% of parents say they expect to spend more entertaining kids during the holidays than term time, with just 7% spending less.Tech devices such as phones, laptops and tablets are the biggest cost to parents when it comes to keeping children entertained.Parents will spend £401 on tech devices to keep kids busy out of term time – with clubs (the likes of sports, drama, music clubs etc.) coming in second at £366.Dave Edwards, vice president at American Express, said:“Keeping kids entertained over the school holidays might not always be easy but our data shows it is a focus of many parents’ spending, whether it’s a meal out with the family, a sports club, or a games console.We know our cardmembers, many of whom are parents, value entertainment and experiences, and our cards offer that – from access to Amex Experiences, to cashback and tailored offers.”The Bank of England has cut its inflation forecast, and now believes it will fall below its 2% target this spring.CPI inflation is projected to fall to slightly below the 2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker than previously expected owing to the freeze in fuel duty announced in the budget.Last month, the Bank forecast that inflation would fall to 2% in the second quarter of this year.In its minutes. The Bank said on ThursdayThe committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated.The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said:In recent weeks we’ve seen further encouraging signs that inflation is coming down.We’ve held rates again today at 5.25% because we need to be sure that inflation will fall back to our 2% target and stay there.We’re not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction.For the first time since September 2021, no member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee voted for an interest rate hike.Swati Dhingra voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%, maintaining her dovish stance.The other eight – Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, and Dave Ramsden – all voted to leave rates at 5.25%.Mann and Haskel had previously voted to raise rates to 5.5% at last month’s meeting.The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the fifth time in a row.The BoE has been trying to bring down inflation to its 2% target without harming the economy but high interest rates have raised borrowing costs for mortgage holders who are paying more each month to the bank.Inflation slowed to 3.4% in February, down from January’s 4%, the lowest since September 2021, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Market analysts argue that with consistent falls in the growth rate of inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee is running out of reasons not to cut rates.Read more hereThe Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain #BankRate at 5.25%. https://t.co/G4tzjXd6XJ pic.twitter.com/a6ziXsHjXX— Bank of England (@bankofengland) March 21, 2024Shares at Next (NXT.L) jumped as much as 5% in London, touching a record high, after it beat forecasts with a 5% rise in pre-tax profits last year.The fashion and homewares retailer saw pre-tax profits hit a record £918m ($1,172m) in the year to the end of January, which was £3m higher than its previous guidance. It predicted profits would now come in at £960m in 2024.Meanwhile, sales at the high street bellwether increased 5.9% to £5.8bn.Lord Wolfson, chief executive, said: “It has been a long time since we started a year in a more positive frame of mind. On the face of it, the consumer environment looks more benign than it has for a number of years, albeit there are some significant uncertainties.”He added: ""It feels like we are now entering a new era.""Next bought majority stakes in brands including Fatface, Cath Kidston and Reiss during the year, and is looking for opportunities to invest in more brandsIt also plans to expand in the US, Middle East and Asia via new partnerships including a tie-up with US department store Nordstrom and new franchise and licensing deals in India.See what other tickers are trending hereBritain’s private sector expanded for a fifth month in a row in a further sign that the economy is moving out of recession.According to S&P Global's UK PMI, the reading for March came in at 52.9, down from 53 in February but above the 50 mark which separates contraction from growth.Service sector growth was quicker than that seen in the manufacturing sector but it lost some momentum in the month, coming in at a three-month low of 53.4.Meanwhile, manufacturing production increased for the first time since February last year.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, said:Further signs of the UK economy having pulled out of last year’s brief recession are provided by the provisional PMI data for March.A further robust expansion of business activity ended the economy’s best quarter since the second quarter of last year.The survey data are indicative of first quarter GDP rising 0.25% to thereby signal a reassuringly solid rebound from the technical recession seen in the second half of 2023.The number of young workers on zero-hour contracts has reached a new record, it has been revealed.According to analysis by the Work Foundation, some 136,000 more workers were given zero-hour contracts in 2023 compared to 2022, with two thirds of those being 16–24 year olds.The Work Foundation said only a minority of zero-hour workers have regular pay and access to rights.Its data suggested three in four of the 1.1 million people on zero-hour contracts are in “severely insecure work”.Alice Martin, head of research at the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, said:“Zero-hour contracts have previously been hailed the answer to flexible work, but our research shows too often it is only employers that have choices, workers do not.“The data shows these contracts affect certain workers more than others, and it is young workers – particularly young women – who are bearing the brunt of policy-makers inaction.“After a decade of indecision over zero-hour contracts, the UK has fallen behind and now our younger generation are paying the price.“Other nations have already either banned zero-hour contracts or heavily regulated their use, so we need to catch up and find a better balance between workplace security and flexibility.”The research also indicated that black workers are 2.7 times more likely than white workers to be on zero-hour contracts and workers from multiple/mixed backgrounds are 2.3 times more likely than white workers to be on zero-hour contracts.Following the Swiss interest rate decision, Norway has left their interest rates on hold at 4.5%On the back of the move, governor Ida Wolden Bache said:“The policy rate will likely need to be maintained at the current level for some time ahead in order to bring inflation back to the 2% target within a reasonable time horizon.""Switzerland’s central bank has surprisingly lowered its policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5% from 1.75% as inflation in the country fell to just 1.2% in February.The move means the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is the first major central bank to cut interest rates in the current cycle.Financial markets were expecting it to hold rates today.SNB said that “the fight against inflation over the past two and a half years has been effective”.""For some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability. According to the new forecast, inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years.""With its decision, the SNB is taking into account the reduced inflationary pressure as well as the appreciation of the Swiss franc in real terms over the past year. The policy rate cut also supports economic activity. Today’s easing thus ensures that monetary conditions remain appropriate.""Watch: SNB Cuts Key Interest Rate to 1.5% to Contain FrancNationwide Building Society has agreed terms to take over rival Virgin Money, paying 220p per share, including a planned 2p-per-share dividend payout.This is a 38%% premium to Virgin Money’s share price on 6 March, and values it at £2.9bn.The move will now create a combined group with £366bn in total assets, almost 700 branches and more than 23 million customers.It also solidifies Nationwide’s position as the second-largest mortgage lender after Lloyds Banking Group.Bosses at Virgin Money, the UK’s sixth-largest retail bank, could share £6m from the deal.Nationwide said:“Nationwide’s board agreed that a binding offer to acquire Virgin Money was in the best interests of the society and its present and future members, following full consideration and the appropriate due diligence, and after taking comments from members into account.”Watch: How does inflation affect interest rates?Download the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/ftse-100-live-european-stocks-bank-of-england-interest-rates-090205705.html
2024-03-21 16:50:02+00:00,US accuses Apple of illegal monopoly over smartphone market,"The US government has accused Apple of illegally abusing a monopoly over the smartphone market in a landmark legal challenge to the iPhone maker.The Justice Department, alongside 16 states, sued the tech giant on Thursday claiming it prevents users from switching to cheaper rival Android phones by restricting apps that could challenge its power.It is the latest in a wave of landmark monopoly abuse cases from the US government seeking to rein in big tech, and its first against Apple.Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, said: “We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.”Apple said that the case risked the US government interfering in how technology is made, and vowed to challenge it.A spokesman said: “If successful, [this lawsuit] would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.“It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”The US charges centre on claims that Apple deliberately undermines software and accessories that would create a more even playing field between iPhones and Android devices.This includes refusing to make its iMessage app compatible with Android phones, and preventing rival messaging apps such as WhatsApp from sending text messages.The Justice Department’s lawsuit said many smartphone users feel social stigma and exclusion when messaging using an Android phone.It said: “Apple has made the quality of cross-platform messaging worse, less innovative, and less secure for users so that its customers have to keep buying iPhones.”The lawsuit also claims that Apple has restricted so-called “super apps”, which allow users to carry out multiple tasks within a single app, for fear that their adoption would make users less dependent on iPhones and enable easier switching between devicesIt quotes one Apple executive as saying: “Imagine buying a [expletive] Android for 25 bux [sic] at a garage sale and it works fine… And you have a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases like that there are.”US regulators have launched lawsuits against Google, Meta and Amazon in recent years and the case against Apple had been widely expected.The company is also facing new scrutiny in Europe, which has recently introduced laws seeking to rein in big tech’s power. The EU will announce its own probes into Apple and Google under the new Digital Markets Act in the coming days, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

2024-03-21 16:35:26+00:00,DOJ vs Apple: Tech giant under fire for antitrust allegations,"The United States Department of Justice has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant Apple (AAPL), alleging that the smartphone manufacturer engages in monopolistic practices. According to the DOJ, Apple's business model restricts competition, resulting in harm to both developers and consumers.Yahoo Finance's Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details, providing insights into the details of the suit.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFO: The Department of Justice accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Now this is the culmination of a five-year probe into one of the world's most valuable technology companies. Here's what Attorney General Merrick Garland had to say just moments ago.MERRICK GARLAND: Monopolies like Apple's threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers. And they increase costs for consumers. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.RACHELLE AKUFO: Well, for more on this, Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley is here with more. So Dan, give us your big takeaways here. What do we know?- Yeah, Rachelle, I think the main thing that you would look at here is how broad the scope of this suit is. It really seems to go after virtually every part of Apple's business related to the iPhone and App Store.They specifically call out Apple allegedly blocking access to things like digital wallet's ability to use the tap to pay feature so that would be if a third party wallet developer wanted to go ahead and give you the ability to not only use their app, but then go up to a payment terminal at your local store, you wouldn't be able to tap to pay. You would only be able to do that with Apple's wallet. And so they go after Apple for that.They talk about how the Apple Watch is only compatible with the iPhone rather than Android devices. And how Apple makes it more difficult for users of third party watches, those that are not the Apple Watch, to use them on the iPhone by limiting functionality.It also calls out the App Store and how it controls that and the App Store fees that it offers. It further calls out the limiting-- Apple limiting the use of super apps, so-called individual apps that let you control multiple different smaller apps within them, something that Elon Musk is trying to create with X.They also refer to things like cloud gaming. Microsoft has been heavy on Apple with this where they want to get their Xbox Cloud Gaming app onto the iPhone and iPad but haven't been able to. So they forced users to go to a website instead of an actual app which would make it easier.So it really seems as though they're going after a broad number of things with regards to the iPhone itself. And in fact, Merrick Garland talks about in a release the issue with the green and blue bubbles when it comes to messaging saying that Apple is basically doing that itself and making users less secure when they speak between iPhone users and Android users. And that they can change that on their own if they wanted to.So you know, I think the main thing to look at is the potential impact that this could have on some of Apple's key businesses. That includes services through the App Store. That includes wearables through the Apple Watch. And then obviously, the iPhone because if they make-- if they're forced to make these changes, it may make Android phones more appealing to other users.Now that all depends, right? There's the status symbol that the iPhone stands for a lot of consumers. There's also-- so many consumers are now used to it, the comfortability that people have with iPhones. So they may stick around because of that. There's also just the idea that you've already purchased so many goods that go along with the iPhone that seem to work better with it, which the lawsuit is basically calling out, that could be a reason why you may want to stick with Apple.But you know, if there are options out there that look more attractive after this suit, then people may start to try those out, test the waters with Android devices. Maybe Android smartwatches. Maybe that means different app stores that they're able to access. So it could be a big change.And just on the App Store front really quick, you know, this is already changing in the EU as a result of the Digital Markets Act. There's going to be third party app stores on iOS and Android, by the way. And Epic Games said that they're going to release their own App Store on iOS and Android in that region. So it's not something that isn't unheard of obviously within the EU. How long it takes, if it ever takes place in the US, we'll just have to wait and see.RACHELLE AKUFO: Indeed. But clearly, Apple in the eye there of regulators that are on both sides-- both sides there.

2024-03-21 16:26:38+00:00,"Green bubbles, Apple Pay and other reasons why America says Apple is breaking the law","“Buy your mom an iPhone.”That was Apple CEO Tim Cook’s famous response at Vox’s 2022 Code Conference, when a reporter complained that her mother couldn’t see the videos she texted to her mom’s Android phone because they were grainy and slow.It’s also a quip that US Attorney General Merrick Garland quoted – and sharply criticized – Thursday at a press conference announcing the Justice Department’s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, in which the Biden administration and 16 states allege Apple is illegally abusing the iPhone’s monopoly power in the smartphone market.The massive lawsuit against one of the world’s largest companies claims Apple is breaking the law by carefully curating its app store and customer experience, designed to lure customers in and keep them buying Apple products and services – to the exclusion of competitors.Apple, in a statement, said it disagreed with the lawsuit and would fight it vigorously.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” the company said.If successful, the suit could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach to hardware and software. It could be made to open up its iPhone to alternative app stores and its technologies like iMessage with Android phones.The Justice Department, in its complaint, highlighted five ways it says Apple is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of Americans.With iMessage, Apple created an enhanced text messaging service that allows people to seamlessly communicate with one another, sending rich text, high-quality video and audio that uploads almost instantly – as long as it’s sent to another iPhone customer.When those messages get sent to people with Android phones, they appear grainy, they can be slow to load, and they can miss out on key features like emoji responses, editing functionality and end-to-end encryption. The dreaded “green bubbles” that mark Android users within iMessage – and particularly the lower-quality performance – are illegal, the Justice Department alleges.“As any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message, or received a tiny, grainy video can attest — Apple’s anticompetitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-Apple products,” Garland said on Thursday. “As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging. And it does so intentionally.”Apple last year said it would adopt a new standard of technology for communication with Android phones that will open up some, but not all, of those features. The green bubbles will remain.Apple helped revolutionize the way we pay for things, tying customers’ credit cards to technology inside iPhones to make payments more secure and seamless. And Apple takes a tiny payment for each transaction.But Apple Pay is the only way iPhone owners can pay for stuff using that technology on an iPhone. Apple, citing security reasons, doesn’t allow third-party apps to access the chip that allows for iPhones to make mobile payments. It also could entice some customers to stick with iPhones when they’d otherwise switch to a competitor, the lawsuit alleges.“Apple also deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets would provide,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Cross-platform digital wallets would offer an easier, more seamless, and potentially more secure way for users to switch from the iPhone to another smartphone.”Apple Watch, one of Apple’s most successful products, is not compatible with Android phones – on purpose, the Justice Department alleges.Although some smartwatches work seamlessly with any kind of smartphone, Apple Watches, a market leader, require iPhones to operate. That locks customers into Apple’s ecosystem of hardware and software, forcing Apple Watch customers to buy iPhones.“Apple uses smartwatches, a costly accessory, to prevent iPhone customers from choosing other phones,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Having copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers, Apple now prevents those developers from innovating and limits the Apple Watch to the iPhone to prevent a negative ‘impact to iPhone sales.’”The only way to get apps on an iPhone is through Apple’s proprietary app store. Apple has long claimed that its approach to maintaining what apps can and cannot be used on an iPhone helps customers. It prevents spam and harmful apps, Apple says.It forces apps into Apple’s onerous limitations and expensive 30% commissions, the Justice Department argues. And it limits competition.For example, the Justice Department cites cloud-based gaming app stores as a service that Apple illegally prevents from appearing on an iPhone. Companies that want to stream games to customers have to load each individual game to the app store, which prevents companies from marketing and selling potentially powerful and popular competitive technology to customers.Apple forces app developers to write code specifically for its operating system, restricting developers from coding using universal languages that could offer a single app experience across any device.That prevents apps from becoming “super apps” – apps that run identically on Apple’s iOS iPhone operating system and Google’s Android OS. Apple also restricts “mini programs” – apps within apps that effectively run on the web. The Justice Department says that requirement locks developers into Apple’s system.“Since at least 2017, Apple has arbitrarily imposed exclusionary requirements that unnecessarily and unjustifiably restrict mini programs and super apps,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Apple exerted its control over app distribution to stifle others’ innovation.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/green-bubbles-apple-pay-other-162638606.html

After starting formal investigations, regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.The commission in Brussels and Meta declined to comment. Apple and Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Apple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) EU fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.Spotify, which triggered the initial EU complaint over the App Store, said Apple’s DMA proposals to levy additional charges on developers were “unacceptable” and “nonsensical” and requested a meeting with the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager.

2024-03-21 16:12:10+00:00,Apple sued in a landmark iPhone monopoly lawsuit,"The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling – and in some cases, restricting – how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there’s a law for that,” he added.For example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message – but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.The company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors’ products are far more limited in their capabilities.“Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,” Garland said on Thursday.This year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.And Apple maintains a 30% commission on most sales through its app store – a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple’s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.“We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” Apple said in a statement.Thursday’s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.Apple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a “dangerous precedent” and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in its statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”Thursday’s lawsuit against Apple seeks three specific remedies that could dramatically change the company’s business model.The Justice Department wants a court order barring Apple from using its app store to block innovative new apps. It also wants the court to block Apple-imposed restrictions that prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other technologies from integrating with the iPhone.It also called for the court to prevent Apple from using its contractual terms to “obtain, maintain, extend, or entrench” the company’s alleged monopoly.The complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN, does not explicitly call for a breakup of Apple. But it did not rule out the possibility, and asks for “relief as needed to cure any competitive harm.”According to the complaint, the list of participating states or districts in the suit include New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.Apple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.But the Justice Department’s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple’s practices.The case represents the Biden administration’s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law.Apple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold “monopoly power.” Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.The legal action could weigh on Apple’s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell 3% Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.Along with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration’s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.The Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden’s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.Along with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.To solve Android phone customers’ “green bubble” issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.“It lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,” Migicovsky said. “Technologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.”Those kind of interactions have made Apple’s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.Beginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game “Fortnite.”Apple isn’t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.Those rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don’t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.The US government isn’t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.In a seismic move to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.But critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.Since its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It’s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple’s restrictiveness.In the era led by founder Steve Jobs, “Apple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,” said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. “Apple relentlessly innovated.

2024-03-21 16:02:33+00:00,Tim Cook’s job just got a lot more complicated with an antitrust suit piled on top of his China and Europe problems,"Tim Cook is facing fires everywhere.The U.S. Justice Department and over a dozen states just hit Apple with a long-anticipated blockbuster antitrust suit, covering a vast array of alleged violations that were all aimed at protecting Apple's control of the iPhone ecosystem—placing restrictions on third-party digital wallets and app stores, stymying cross-platform messaging, suppressing cloud gaming services, and more.“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.""This is the U.S. government attempting to do what the EU is trying to achieve with its crackdown on Apple (and other Big Tech firms) via the new Digital Markets Act. Many elements are shared—but these American claims go even further, by adding things like Apple's refusal to let third-party smartwatches work fully with the iPhone.At the time of writing, Apple's share price had fallen by 2.6%. Make no mistake: If the DOJ and states get their way, Apple's whole way of doing business is under threat, and not just in Europe this time.The suit comes just after Cook launched a charm offensive in China, on his latest visit there. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” he said yesterday in a China Daily interview. Today he opened Shanghai’s eighth Apple store, chatting with suppliers and taking selfies with customers.He knows he has his work cut out for him there. Apple's iPhone sales are sliding in the face of strong competition from local champion Huawei, and a drive from Beijing itself to have state employees ditch their iPhones in favor of Chinese devices. The flood of ever-cheaper Chinese electric vehicles was probably a major factor in Apple’s decision to abandon its own auto plans. And tech relations between the U.S. and China keep getting testier and testier.While Cook made his visit, Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Biden administration was considering an escalation of its campaign against the Chinese semiconductor industry by applying sanctions against seven chipmakers and chipmaking-equipment firm in the country, all of which work with Huawei in some capacity. The apparent logic is that existing sanctions haven’t stopped Huawei from making great technological strides, including the introduction of the 7-nanometer chip that powers the Huawei Mate 60 smartphone—the same device that’s been taking a chunk out of iPhone 15 sales in China.Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday built on last week’s anti-TikTok bill by passing a new data-privacy bill called the “Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act.” If it then makes its way through the Senate and gets President Joe Biden’s signature, this law would make it illegal for data brokers to pass on Americans’ sensitive data to any foreign adversary country, which means China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and the Venezuelan regime.And it looks like this measure has a better shot than last week’s bill, which would force China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese concern or see it banned in the U.S. It passed the House 414-0, whereas the TikTok bill passed by 352-65. As Politico notes, even opponents of the TikTok bill like this one because, rather than targeting a particular company, it would limit what an entire sector can do with Americans’ data, making it the first potential federal data-privacy law in a long time. “This is what we should have voted on last week,” Gen Z Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) told the publication.All the Cookian charm in the world can’t make up for this growing U.S. hostility to China’s tech interests, and the responses it will trigger if this continues. And as for the rapidly metastasizing threats to Apple's controlling nature…well, I wouldn't want to be in Cook's shoes right now.More news below.David MeyerWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tim-cook-job-just-got-160233868.html
2024-03-21 16:01:14+00:00,US Sues Apple in Antitrust Case Over iPhone,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general sued Apple Inc., accusing the iPhone maker of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.Most Read from BloombergNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is UnpaidBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 EachJustice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as ThursdayWhat Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondYemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be TargetedThe suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, marks the culmination of a five-year probe into the world’s second-most-valuable technology company. The Biden administration has made competition a cornerstone of its economic policy, with Silicon Valley becoming a key focus. And it comes as the European Commission is gearing up to announce probes into compliance with the Digital Markets Act — the European Union’s new gatekeeper rules for Big Tech — by Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Shares of Apple were down as much as 3.8% on the news, their biggest intraday decline since Feb. 2.The lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.“This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” according to the suit, which seeks changes in Apple’s practices.‘Dangerous Precedent’US Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference that Apple has “consolidated its monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse.”The company said the lawsuit was “wrong on the facts and the law,” warned that it would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.”“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”Apple recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.The group of attorneys general includes those of California, New Jersey and Washington, DC.Meanwhile, even though Apple has made several changes to its App Store policies in Europe to comply with the Digital Markets Act, Apple and Google are set to face full-blown EU probes into their compliance in the coming days, Bloomberg reported Thursday.The US probe comes despite Cupertino, California-based Apple having announced earlier that it will allow European users to download iPhone apps from the web, let developers offer discounts outside the App Store and permit third-party marketplaces to sell apps.The Trump administration’s Justice Department opened its antitrust probe of Apple in 2019. A 2020 House investigation into four tech giants found that Apple operates as a monopoly in software distribution on the iPhone, generating massive profits from commissions of as much as 30% that it charges developers.In 2020, Epic Games Inc., the maker of the popular online video game Fortnite, sued Apple over its App Store. A federal judge found the App Store policies didn’t violate federal antitrust law but did breach California state law.As a result of that case, Apple said in January that it would allow US developers to use alternative payment systems, but charge a lower fee of 27% for most digital purchases or 12% on subscriptions. Epic is contesting those changes, saying they are inadequate.On Wednesday, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and X Corp., the company formerly known as Twitter, also took aim at Apple’s proposed changes, saying the iPhone maker has imposed onerous limitations on links to alternate payment systems.Latest Antitrust ChallengeThe US lawsuit is the latest in a string of antitrust cases challenging the tech giant. Earlier this month, the European Union fined Apple €1.8 billion ($2 billion) for shutting out rival music services on the iPhone. Apple is appealing.Read More: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to ChinaLast week, the company reversed course and said it would restore Epic’s developer account, allowing the Fortnite maker to build its own EU app store, which could compete with Apple’s own. That came a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker.The latest case marks the third time the Justice Department has sued Apple for antitrust violations in the past 14 years. In 2010, the company agreed to settle allegations that it illegally agreed not to poach employees from Google, Adobe Inc. or Walt Disney Co.’s Pixar.Two years later, the Justice Department sued Apple and book publishers for illegally fixing the price of e-books sold on the iPad. After the Justice Department won at trial, Apple was forced to accept a monitor and adopt policies and training to improve its compliance with antitrust law.Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter said on Thursday that the Justice Department’s suit is distinct from previous lawsuits against Apple, arguing that the company has engaged in a deliberate decadelong course of conduct to maintain and extend its iPhone monopoly. He also pushed back on claims that the case would undermine consumer privacy and security on smartphones.“Apple’s conduct has made its ecosystem less private and less secure,” Kanter said at the press conference.--With assistance from Bob Van Voris, Mark Gurman and Samuel Stolton.(Adds quotes, details, EU news and context in first two sections and Kanter quote at end.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWall Street and Silicon Valley Elites Are Warming Up to TrumpWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-21 15:58:01+00:00,Factbox-US takes on Apple as efforts to curtail Big Tech gather momentum,"(Reuters) - Apple was on Thursday sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, the latest antitrust action against Big Tech firms accused by regulators of operating monopolies and abusing their power.The case is the fifth by the U.S. government aimed at reining in tech giants. Below are some such actions and other lawsuits:APPLEThe U.S. Justice Department has been probing Apple since 2019 and alleged on Thursday that the company has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing.The California-based firm is also under regulatory scrutiny in Europe and was earlier this month hit with a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through restrictions on its App Store.Apple is appealing the penalty but faces more scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Markets Act — new rules for Big Tech that went into effect earlier this month.Other lawsuits include a class action filed on March 1 in San Jose, California federal court accusing the company of monopolizing the market for cloud storage in its mobile devices.ALPHABETThe evidentiary phase of a court battle between Google and the U.S. government wrapped up in November. In the trial, which started on Sept. 12, the Justice Department sought to prove that Google is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.The case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in tech giants.Google was in February hit with a 2.1-billion-euro lawsuit by 32 media groups including Axel Springer and Schibsted, alleging that they had suffered losses due to the company's practices in digital advertising. Last month, Google also asked a U.S. judge to throw out a jury verdict in a lawsuit by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games that found the technology giant had abused its market dominance in setting rules for its app store. Epic Games had prevailed in the high-profile antitrust trial that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.META PLATFORMSAn appeals court ruled earlier this month that Meta cannot stop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission from reopening a probe into its Facebook unit's privacy practices for now. The company had objected, citing the $5 billion fine it paid and range of safeguards it had agreed.In October, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta and its Instagram unit, accusing them of fueling a youth mental health crisis by making their social media platforms addictive.The company was hit with a record 1.2 billion euro fine by its lead European Union privacy regulator in May 2023 over its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the U.S.AMAZON.COMThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com in September, charging the company with harming consumers with higher prices.The FTC has also filed other lawsuits against the company, including one accusing the e-commerce giant of duping ""millions of consumers"" into purchasing subscriptions for Prime services.($1 = 0.9178 euros)(Reporting by Priyanka.G, Jaspreet Singh and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/factbox-us-takes-apple-efforts-155801147.html
2024-03-21 15:51:56+00:00,DOJ Sues Apple Over Smartphone Market Monopoly,"Apple has found itself on the wrong end of a civil antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and 16 other state and district attorneys general. The lawsuit accuses Apple of monopolizing smartphone markets, violating the Sherman Act.The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. According to the lawsuit, Apple illegally maintains a monopoly over smartphones by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access points from, developers.The DOJ says Apple undermines apps, products and services that would otherwise make users less reliant on the iPhone, promote interoperability, and lower costs for consumers and developers. The company also exercises its monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.Most Read on IEN:Can the World’s Largest Plane Save Wind Power?Unilever to Cut 7,500 JobsPODCAST: GM Tattles on Drivers, Weird Chinese EVs, CEO Sells Fake ImplantsPair Accused of Stealing Battery Manufacturing Secrets from TeslaIn a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland says Apple has allegedly held monopoly power in the smartphone market by violating federal antitrust law, not just by staying ahead of the competition on its own merits. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,"" Garland adds.The lawsuit contends that Apple uses its control over the iPhone to engage in a broad, sustained and illegal course of conduct designed to maintain its monopoly while extracting as much revenue as possible. The complaint alleges that Apple's anticompetitive course of conduct has taken several ever-evolving forms, including:Blocking Super Apps: Apple has disrupted the growth of apps with broad functionality that would make it easier for consumers to switch between competing smartphone platforms.Suppressing Mobile Cloud Streaming Services: Apple has blocked the development of cloud-streaming apps and services that would allow consumers to play video games and other cloud-based applications without paying for expensive smartphone hardware.Excluding Cross-Platform Messaging Apps: Apple has made the quality of cross-platform messaging worse, less innovative and less secure for users.Diminishing Functionality of Non-Apple Smartwatches: Apple has limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches, so users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones.Limiting Third-Party Digital Wallets: Apple has prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, inhibiting the creation of cross-platform third-party digital wallets.The complaint also alleges that Apple's conduct affects web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising and location services.""For years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of 'Whac-A-Mole' contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,"" says Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, in a statement. He says the lawsuit seeks to ensure Apple cannot deploy the same tactics in other vital markets.Apple is a publicly traded company.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.""Apple has maintained monopoly power ... by violating federal antitrust law,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news conference Thursday. ""We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct that hurts consumers and developers.""For consumers, he said, Apple's conduct has resulted in fewer choices and less innovation. For developers, it has ""meant being forced to play by rules that insulate Apple from competition.""""We allege that Apple has consolidated its monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse,"" Garland said.He added that Apple accomplishes this in two main ways: one, by imposing heavy fees on third-party developers who use Apple's ecosystem, and two, by ""restricting connections"" between these third-party apps and Apple's user interface.Garland cited difficulties in cross-platform messaging from an iPhone user to a non-iPhone user, saying that Apple ""knowingly degrades quality and security for its users, making iPhone users perceive other phones as lower quality even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging.""Apple said in a statement that disagrees with the lawsuit, adding that it will ""vigorously defend against it.""""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple said.

The DOJ accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Our legal reporter Alexis Keenan joining us now on set with these details. Alexis, what are we learning?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so so far this is what Bloomberg is reporting. We're waiting to get a copy of the suit. And what it says is that these AGs and the DOJ have filed antitrust claims against Apple in federal court in New Jersey.And it's targeting the iPhone ecosystem, saying that the company maintains its dominance over that ecosystem by blocking competition for services like financial services businesses. So think about payment apps, also device trackers, things like the AirTag. And what they're saying is that Apple is stifling innovation, stifling competition, alleging that the company is using its power over this app distribution on the app phone in order to block competition.Now, in response, Apple is saying this, ""The lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent,"" they say, ""empowering the government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.""Now, this is a major target against Apple because if you take a look at its annual revenues for 2023, you have the iPhone, right, as its biggest driver of revenue, $200 billion last year. So this is a major threat to the company.And if you go back to the lawsuit that-- the antitrust lawsuit that Epic and Apple were battling out over the course of the last few years that the DOJ joined, that lawsuit it had to do with the App Store. But importantly, it was targeting part of this ecosystem.Now, you have the iPhones, the App Store, iWatch, iMessage, AirTags, all potentially involved in this suit. But just such a big deal. And during the testimony in that Apple and EPIC trial, Tim Cook got up, took the stand.And what he was talking about was that Apple needs to produce its products in this way in this ecosystem because they say it protects people's data security, protects their personal privacy. This, Apple said, was of pinnacle importance to the company. They want to be able to produce products this way.So I would not be surprised if when we hear Apple's response further in this case, if we might hear echoes of that. And that's what I'm seeing here in this statement from Apple saying that it would be a dangerous precedent for the government to have a hand in trying to tell companies how they should do things like protect data.BRAD SMITH: And precedent is the key word here too because it's not just the US and how they would potentially look at it regulators here. But then also elsewhere around the world, where might they face similar tests? And how could that mindset that now the DOJ and multiple attorneys general that they're moving with-- moving forward with, how could that permeate more broadly and potentially impact Apple as well?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, it already has, arguably, right? Because you had the EU, the European Commission, its antitrust regulator there, just last week or so, a $2 billion fine against Apple. But it was targeting the way that the company handles music apps within the App Store.So most of the litigation so far, most of the antitrust complaints have been specifically about the App Store. So what this does is it really broadens that antitrust lens. We still need to take a harder look and a more detailed look at this complaint to get to the actual-- the specifics here. But no doubt, this is a major broadening of what is being targeted in Apple's products.SEANA SMITH: And, Alex, I'm curious just in terms of what this could also tell us about further pressure for not just Apple but also for some of the other tech competitors out there, very different business models obviously, this specifically targeting the App Store and iPhone. But what this could, I guess, lend to some of the activity that we could see given the focus that we see from the DOJ on Apple at this point.ALEXIS KEENAN: Yes. And not just DOJ, the FTC as well, right. So Apple's been kind of this late comer getting on the defensive side of these antitrust arguments. You have the DOJ's case against Google in Washington, DC, pending against search and search advertising.Any minute now, we could get a decision from the judge in that case. That one's being handled by a judge. Big case against Google there. Also you have the FTC going after Amazon, going after Facebook, and unsettled cases.You have another case with states going after Google on similar grounds. So Apple now being added to this fray. Certainly, the Biden administration making these major pushes on antitrust front against these big tech companies.But also these investigations, many of them started with the Trump administration, so we can't necessarily say it's attributable to the Biden administration. And look, this case, this Apple case, this will extend long past this current administration. And if the history is any indicator, we could see these cases go out as far as decades, right, in the case of Microsoft. And they can go on quite a long time.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Absolutely massive case for us to track going forward. Alexis, thanks so much for joining on the snap here to make sure that we can break this down. Appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/doj-accuses-apple-iphone-monopoly-151205746.html

The lawsuit, which the department said was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, targets Apple's grip on the smartphone market, according to a press release from the DOJ.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Garland said in a statement. ""We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""""The Justice Department will vigorously enforce antitrust laws that protect consumers from higher prices and fewer choices. That is the Justice Department’s legal obligation and what the American people expect and deserve,"" he added.APPLE ESCALATES EPIC GAMES FEUD BY BLOCKING FORTNITE APP IN EUThe DOJ lawsuit alleges that Apple has blocked innovative apps, suppressed mobile cloud streaming services, excluded cross-platform messaging apps, diminished functionality of non-Apple smartwatches and limited third-party digital wallets.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPApple pushed back on the lawsuit in a statement to FOX Business.""At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users.

""From Day 2, #DMA is already showing very concrete results.""APPLE HIT WITH NEARLY $2B EU ANTITRUST FINEEpic ultimately lost its court battle on U.S. antitrust rules violations, however, and the game maker’s plan to break Apple’s rules in protest got the popular Fortnite game banned from Apple devices.

2024-03-21 14:57:48+00:00,"U.S., California sue Apple, alleging company monopolized smartphone market","The U.S. Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general, including California's, filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, alleging that the technology giant attempted to monopolize the smartphone market to boost its business.The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, alleges that Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple violated antitrust laws by preventing other companies from offering applications that compete with Apple's products or that make rival smartphones more attractive to iPhone users. The lawsuit comes after a years-long investigation into the company's business practices.The lawsuit seeks to restore competition in the tech market to protect customers from higher prices and expand their product choices. The government took issue with Apple restricting access to points of connection between third-party apps and the iPhone operating system, which makes those non-Apple apps and accessories less useful, said U.S. Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,"" Garland said during a news conference Thursday. ""We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers. For consumers, that has meant fewer choices; higher prices and fees; lower quality smartphones, apps, and accessories; and less innovation from Apple and its competitors.""IPhones are the most popular smartphone in the United States, accounting for more than 60% of sales, analysts say. Its main competition comes from phones made by Samsung and other manufacturers that run Alphabet's Android operating system.Read more: Apple to pay $490 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about iPhone sales in ChinaApple generated annual net revenues of $383 billion in 2023 and a net income of $97 billion. IPhone sales made up the largest chunk of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" an Apple spokesperson wrote in a statement. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.""The government alleges that over the years, Apple has blocked banks and other finance companies from developing alternative payment products that would compete with Apple's digital wallet on the iPhone. At the same time, the company has encouraged those banks to participate in Apple Wallet. Apple has also made it challenging for someone with an iPhone to use non-Apple smartwatches and other connected devices in an effort to boost its own products, Garland said.Garland used text messages between iPhone and Android users as an example of the company's alleged monopolistic practices. He argued that Apple purposely diminishes the functionality of its own messaging app and other apps to degrade quality when interacting with non-Apple devices — leading to conversations that can't be encrypted, videos with lower picture quality, and the loss of editing functions and message-in-progress indicators— in an effort to make iPhones seem to be a superior product.""As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging,"" Garland said.John Bergmayer, legal director at the nonprofit public interest group Public Knowledge, applauded the lawsuit, calling it a crucial step toward restoring competition and boosting innovation in the mobile ecosystem.""Consumers are paying the price for Apple's abuse of its gatekeeper power — not just in higher smartphone prices, but in reduced innovation and a more limited, locked-down user experience,"" Bergmayer said in a statement. ""As the complaint describes, privacy and security do not justify Apple’s actions. Protecting users does not justify, nor require, anticompetitive and illegal conduct.""""In fact, as the complaint alleges, Apple’s actions can harm the security and privacy of smartphone users, by putting obstacles in the way of secure, cross-platform messaging,"" he said.Read more: Stalked with an AirTag? A class-action lawsuit against Apple in California will move forwardThursday's lawsuit is the latest lodged by U.S. officials against large technology companies. The government has also filed antitrust complaints in recent years against Amazon, Google and Meta.This isn't the first time Apple has faced scrutiny.The Justice Department last sued Apple in 2012, accusing the company of colluding with book publishers to fix e-book prices. Apple was required to pay a $450-million settlement in the case.Epic Games, the maker of ""Fortnite,"" sued Apple in 2020 alleging that the company violated federal law because it banned third-party app marketplaces on its operating system, requiring all developers to use Apple's App Store. The dispute began after Apple booted “Fortnite” from the App Store because Epic had created a workaround to paying the 30% fee Apple collected from developers on customers’ in-app purchases.A U.S. District judge ruled in that case that Apple didn't maintain a monopoly in the market for mobile games, but ordered the company to permit developers to alert customers to different payment options outside the App Store.Apple was also hit this month with a $2-billion penalty by the European Union following an investigation into allegations it prevented music streaming competitors, such as Spotify, from communicating with users about deals that could draw customers away from Apple's App Store.Although European regulators have focused largely on the company's App Store, the U.S. government's case is much more sweeping, taking aim at Apple's entire menu of products and services.Deputy Atty. Gen. Lisa Monaco said that Apple has been working for years to tighten its hold on the smartphone market, shortchanging consumers.""It has done so not through product improvements — but by maintaining a chokehold on competition — locking its customers in to the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,"" Monaco said.

2024-03-21 14:30:00+00:00,US takes on Apple in antitrust lawsuit,"By Doina Chiacu and Stephen NellisWASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Apple, the first major antitrust effort against the iPhone maker by the Biden administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by U.S. regulators, including Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""The Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games.One of Apple's most lucrative businesses - its App Store, which charges developers commissions of up to 30% - has already survived a lengthy legal challenge under U.S. law by Epic. While the lawsuit found that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple's in-app payment commission.In Europe, Apple's App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores.The rulings on Apple's App Store forced the Justice Department to look at Apple's other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the iPhone.Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple's own Apple Pay service.And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices.Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone's hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.

2024-03-21 10:28:48+00:00,Tim Cook is on a charm offensive in China to revive flagging iPhone sales,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.Tim Cook is making a high-profile visit to China that coincides with Apple opening a huge new store in Shanghai — its second biggest in the world. It’s all part of a push by the company to reverse a decline in iPhone sales in its most important international market.The new $11.6 million outlet — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an, which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second only to Apple’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue, Chinese state media reported.“Nonghao Shanghai!” Apple CEO Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means “hello” in Shanghainese. “I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.”Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai.In Shanghai, mainland China’s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China.The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.In 2023, Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever, with a record 17.3% market share, according to IDC Research.But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64%.Cook’s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain.“China remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint.“With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,” he said.Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year.“China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities.On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports.“There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,” Cook told a group of reporters.He met with Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker, at the session, according to a video he posted on his Weibo account.Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world,” according to China Daily. The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts.“Cook is not taking a step back from China. It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,” Ives said.Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo.Others told CNN they were planning to go.“I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store,” said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system,” she said, calling the products “sleek and beautiful.”Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit.“I’ve heard that it’s quite big,” he said. “I just want to have a look.”Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism.“Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won’t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,” Dolores said.“For international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,” Wei said. “Just look at the products.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-tim-cook-goes-china-090636115.html

Still, value investors won't care much about that, as the stock's 10% decline in 2024 is moving it into value territory.While there are concerns over slowing smartphone sales growth, not least in China, and Apple's year-over-year growth in product sales was minimal in the first quarter of its financial 2024, the long-term value case for the stock is based on its higher-margin services growth.In Q1 2019, Apple's revenue share from services was just 13.8%, but that's up to 19.3% in the recently reported fourth quarter. That increase comes down to an 82% rise in services sales, compared to just 22% for products.Given that Apple's services come with roughly double the gross profit margin of its products (around 70%, compared to mid-35% for products), Apple's gross profit margin increased from 38.4% to 45.9% over the period outlined above.The increase highlights the value case for the stock -- long-term margin expansion from growing services revenue on the back of expanding its installed base of products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That installed base stands at 2.2 billion devices , and its paid subscriptions grew at a double-digit rate in its recently reported quarter. As such, Apple looks set for excellent long-term sales growth with margin expansion leading to earnings and cash flow growth.Apple only has a 0.6% dividend yield, but it has raised its dividend every year since 2013.Because it is such a massive company, Apple pays the second most dividends of any U.S.-based company, ahead of ExxonMobil and behind only Microsoft.Trading on 24.7 times its estimated free cash flow in 2024, Apple is not a screaming value stock. But if the market keeps selling the stock off, then value investors will eventually step in.Scott Levine (Chevron): It's been a rough road for Chevron stock over the past year. While the S&P 500 has soared almost 34%, shares of Chevron have headed in the other direction, sinking almost 2%. Savvy investors know that sometimes when the market punishes a stock, it provides a great buying opportunity -- an insight that value investors understand well. This is clearly the case with Chevron. While shares may be out of favor now, those who are patient can pick up a quality stock at a discount. Plus, they can get paid while they wait for the stock to rebound, thanks to its forward dividend yield of 4.2%.Currently, shares of Chevron are sitting in the bargain bin. Priced at 7.5 times operating cash flow, Chevron stock is trading at a discount to its five-year average cash flow valuation of 8.4. Prefer the price-to-earnings ratio? No problem. The stock still seems inexpensive, trading at 13.6 times trailing earnings, while its five-year average P/E is 14.7.There are a few reasons why forward-looking investors will want to gas up on Chevron stock now. For one, management is taking a judicious approach to the payout. Over the past three years, Chevron's payout ratio has averaged a conservative 49.8%. Chevron is also developing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian, where it expects production to grow 10% in 2024 compared to 2023.While the price of oil has ebbed from when West Texas Intermediate, the North American oil benchmark, was trading over $100 per barrel in 2022, it has been rising lately, which may give Chevron stock a boost. Even if it doesn't, though, Chevron stock is a smart way to generate strong passive income -- a strategy of which the Oracle of Omaha is well aware.Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke will generally underperform in a growth-led bull market and outperform during a bear market. Here's how the stock stacks up to the S&P 500 since 2020.Company/Index2024 (YTD as of March 15)2023202220212020Coca-Cola1.6%(7.4%)7.4%8%(0.9%)S&P 5007.3%24.2%(19.4%)26.9%16.3%Data source: YCharts.Granted, these returns don't factor in dividends. But still, Coke has underperformed the market, which is expected because the market has done so well over the period.However, when growth stocks collapsed in 2022, and the market had a terrible year, Coke came through big time and outperformed the index by 26 percentage points.The best way to invest in Coke isn't to try to beat the market, but to collect a steady stream of passive income from a reliable company. With limited ways to expand the business beyond strategic mergers and acquisitions -- which Coke has done an excellent job of over the last few years -- it's pretty much impossible for the company to keep pace with a growth-fueled market.However, there are signs that Coke is becoming a higher-quality company. Its price raises were a massive success as the company navigated supply chain constraints and offset inflationary effects. Its operating margin is over 28.3%, which is impressively high. For context, Apple's operating margin is 30.8%.The main reason why Berkshire has held Coke for over 30 years is because of the company's growing dividend and buybacks, which reward shareholders without the need to sell stock.With a yield of 3.2% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.2, Coke isn't that expensive, and it yields more than double the S&P 500.Coke is a perfect fit for investors who are focused on capital preservation instead of capital appreciation, are looking to supplement income in retirement, or are risk-averse. Expect Coke to continue underperforming a growth-led market, but to outperform if the narrative flips.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-21 09:20:00+00:00,"3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $1 Million (or More)","Are you thinking big? Like, really big? That is to say, are you looking to turn a tiny amount of money now into a seven-figure stash later?Never say never. Not only is it possible, it happens more often than you might think. The key is time and picking the right stock, of course, and then remaining patient enough to continue holding that ticker through the rough patches.With that as the backdrop, here's a look at three familiar stocks that turned a $1,000 investment into $1 million, if not more. Just be sure to read through the wrap-up that explains what you can learn from these three enormous winners to repeat the feat in the future.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't just a familiar modern-era winner. It's arguably the market's most memorable winner of all time! Shares are up more than 230,000% just since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO) at a split-adjusted price of $0.075. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth around $2.3 million today. That growth has also made Amazon one of the world's biggest companies, as measured by market cap.It's not exactly a secret as to how it happened. Founder and longtime CEO Jeff Bezos saw an opportunity in the internet's infancy, viewing it as a convenience-providing platform where people would eventually do a great deal of their shopping. And he was right. The e-commerce giant alone accounts for over one-third of the United States' total e-commerce sales. That's bigger than the next nine e-commerce platforms combined.It's not just an e-commerce giant anymore, though. It's also a cloud computing powerhouse. Amazon Web Services generated $90.8 billion worth of business last year, turning $24.6 billion of that revenue into operating profit. This arm now makes up roughly two-thirds of the company's entire bottom line. And again, it's a business built from scratch simply because Jeff Bezos saw a budding opportunity and acted.Tech-driven growth isn't the only path to riches, however. Consumer staples can do the job, too. Take Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) as an example. It, too, has made plenty of millionaires out of relatively small investors.OK, there are a couple of important footnotes to add here. One of them is that it's taken Procter & Gamble a lot longer to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million ... several decades longer, to be clear. Second, reaching this seven-figure mark with P&G would have required reinvesting its dividends into more shares of the stock.Slow and steady wins the race, though.Of course, Procter & Gamble also had an unfair competitive advantage. It's owned market-leading brands ranging from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste to Dawn dishwashing liquid for the decades in question. Not only is it easier to maintain a lead you already own, but being a market leader also provides leverage when it comes to keeping competitors in check and distribution partners in tow.Regardless of the reason, P&G has paid off for patient investors.Last but not least, technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has also minted many patient millionaires. The stock's present price of $175 is nearly 175,000% above its split-adjusted IPO price of $0.10 per share. A $1,000 investment in its 1980 IPO would now be worth just under $1.8 million.Granted, Apple's not been a red-hot winner for its entire existence. The company very nearly went bankrupt back in the late 1990s. It required a $150 million cash infusion from Microsoft and the rehiring of Steve Jobs as CEO to turn things around. And even then, things remained a little wobbly for years; the dot-com meltdown of 2000 certainly didn't help matters either. Apple shares didn't make any net progress during this turbulent time.Rather, the bulk of the stock's enormous gain has taken shape since 2007, when the very first iPhone was released. It's not a stretch to suggest this incredibly popular smartphone, in fact, is the crux of the reason for the stock's incredible gains.Whatever the cause, congratulations to the people who understood what a game-changer the iPhone would end up being. It's not just the mobile phone all other phone makers are hoping to compete with. It mainstreamed the very idea of carrying around a web-connected mini-computer in your pocket.The bad news is it's unlikely any of these three stocks can repeat the feat in the same amount of time they first turned $1,000 into $1 million (or more). All three companies are still outstanding. But circumstances were different when each stock began its heroic run-up.The good news is, however, that the reasons Apple, Amazon, and P&G shares performed so well for so long are clear. Lots of other companies behind stocks that haven't yet dished such rallies exhibit these same qualities or soon will if they don't yet. Three of these attributes stand out above the rest.One of these characteristics is a clear competitive advantage. For P&G, it was sheer size, which also ended up being the case for Amazon. For Apple, its edge was a superior product that other manufacturers would often imitate but would never successfully duplicate. Apple also benefited from the fact that it enjoyed complete control of the underlying digital ecosystem -- iOS, the App Store, and more -- that made its devices so functional.Another somewhat related quality of these companies' businesses and core products is that each was and is future-proof. It's an overused example, but it still makes the point perfectly ... it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to circumvent the need for camera film, developing technology and at-home tools that could do the job just as well.Conversely, the companies behind high-performance stocks aren't in jeopardy of becoming obsolete. Consumers will perpetually want newer, more powerful tech and will always want to shop. They'll also need to wash their clothes or brush their teeth. That's why you should be looking for companies that will remain relevant forever.Finally, bear in mind that at least two of these three companies -- Amazon and Apple -- seemed a little out of the ordinary at the time their stocks were getting started on their big gains. We now know they weren't odd, however. These companies were just ahead of their time. The market's next enormous winners will likely look similarly odd. Just look a the bigger picture, considering how consumers and corporations will see their solutions 10 and 20 years into the future.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-21 09:06:36+00:00,Apple’s Tim Cook goes on China charm offensive amid slowing iPhone sales,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.Apple CEO Tim Cook is making a high-profile visit to Shanghai as part of Thursday’s opening of an enormous new flagship store, as the iPhone maker makes a deeper push into its biggest international market amid declining sales.The new $11.6 million store — located in Shanghai’s central district of Jing’an, which is named after a historic temple — is the biggest in China and the second largest globally after the one in New York’s Fifth Avenue, according to Chinese state media reports.“Nonghao Shanghai!” Cook said in a Weibo post on Wednesday, which means “hello” in Shanghainese. “I’m always so happy to be back in this remarkable city.”Cook said he had spent the morning enjoying a traditional breakfast of what appeared to be soup dumplings and soy milk and taking selfies along the city’s famous Bund waterfront with local actor Zheng Kai.In Shanghai, mainland China’s financial hub, Apple now has eight stores, the largest number of any city in the country. There are currently 47 Apple stores in 24 cities across mainland China.The new addition comes as Apple (AAPL) tries to fend off competitors and revive sales in a rocky market with growing headwinds, ranging from an economic slowdown to geopolitical tensions and rising nationalist sentiment.In 2023, Apple grabbed the top spot in China’s smartphone market for the first time ever, with a record 17.3% market share, according to IDC Research.But during the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales in the country slumped 24% from a year ago, according to a separate report by Counterpoint Research from earlier this month. Apple’s market share slid behind that of Vivo, Huawei, and Honor in that period, it added, while rival Huawei’s sales soared 64%.Cook’s visit, his third to the country in a year, underscores China’s significance to Apple as its biggest overseas market and a critical part of its manufacturing supply chain.“China remains a critical market for Apple, particularly in the premium segment above $800, where it holds a dominant position,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst from Counterpoint.“With Huawei’s resurgence and other Chinese [phone makers] gaining traction in offline sales, Apple is proactively strengthening its offline presence, leveraging flagship stores as a key tool to promote high-end smartphones,” he said.Earlier this month, Apple announced it would expand its research center in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen later this year.“China is the heart and lungs of Apple’s growth strategy as Cupertino doubles down on its China strategy with these moves,” said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities.On Wednesday, Cook hosted an information sharing session along with three of Apple’s suppliers — BYD, Lens Technology and Everwin Precision Technology — at its Shanghai office, according to state media reports.“There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to Apple than that of China,” Cook told a group of reporters.He met with Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, the world’s largest electrical vehicle maker, at the session, according to a video he posted on his Weibo account.Cook praised Chinese suppliers as having “the most advanced manufacturing in the world,” according to China Daily. The Apple CEO also visited a film production studio, talked with mobile game developers and took photos with a crowd of shoppers and staff, according to his social media posts.“Cook is not taking a step back from China. It’s the opposite as competition from Huawei ramps up domestically,” Ives said.Apple still has many fans in the country. More than a hundred of them waited in line overnight to be among the first to enter the new store or to get a photo with Cook, according to videos and state media reports circulated on Weibo.Others told CNN they were planning to go.“I’ll go and kinda ‘worship’ the store,” said Dolores, a movie producer in Beijing. She has been using the iPhone, iPad and MacBook for years. “I’ve already grown used to its design and the system,” she said, calling the products “sleek and beautiful.”Wei, a Beijing resident, also said he would visit.“I’ve heard that it’s quite big,” he said. “I just want to have a look.”Both said they would stay loyal to the brand, despite rising calls on the Chinese internet for consumers to switch to homegrown brands to show their patriotism.“Some Chinese brands like Huawei are also doing well with their products. But [I won’t switch.] It should be about mutual achievement [for Apple and Chinese brands], rather than hostility,” Dolores said.“For international products, if you like a brand, there should be no geopolitical divisions,” Wei said. “Just look at the products.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-tim-cook-goes-china-090636115.html

2024-03-20 22:07:21+00:00,"Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group challenge Apple over app store terms","Apple is flouting a court order intended to reshape the iPhone maker’s app store in the United States, according to a court filing by rival tech giants including Meta, Microsoft, X and the dating-app company Match Group.The filing accuses Apple of willfully circumventing the spirit of the original order, which was designed to unlock competition by forcing Apple to let app makers communicate with their users about deals and promotions in specific ways.That order was effectively upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this year when the justices declined to hear the case involving Apple and Epic Games, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite.” But Epic, and now the four other tech companies, say Apple’s plan to comply with the order is a sham.Apple’s plan, Wednesday’s friend-of-the-court filing said, still contains rules that “this Court expressly found to be anti-competitive and imposes new restrictions on app developers that ensure the price competition that the injunction was designed to promote will never materialize.”In a motion accompanying the filing, the companies claimed that Apple’s proposed changes to its app store rules “will have broad real-world impacts on all app developers and their users — not just gaming apps.”The filing was made to lend the tech companies’ support behind Epic Games, which sued Microsoft in 2021 after its signature game, Fortnite, was banned from Apple’s app store in a dispute over Fortnite’s billing method. Epic is arguing that Apple is violating the court’s order requiring Apple to revise app store practices that were deemed anticompetitive.Asked for comment, Apple referred CNN to a document it filed with the US District Court for the Northern District of California in January. That document attests to Apple’s compliance with the court order.That some of the world’s most visible tech companies are leaping into the debate highlights how the long-running, high-stakes fight concerning Apple’s app store is far from over, even after the Supreme Court declined to intervene and landmark regulations affecting Apple in Europe have gone into effect.It also reflects rising criticism of Apple that efforts to regulate the company have triggered a form of begrudging compliance, one in which Apple proclaims to have met its legal obligations but only in ways designed to frustrate others.In the filing, Meta argued it should be allowed to inform users about ways to pay for “boosted posts” on its platform through means other than Apple’s in-app purchase system. Boosted posts, Meta said, are typically used by small businesses to promote their products on Facebook and Instagram. In February, Meta announced it would be passing along the costs of Apple’s fees, effectively hiking the price of boosted posts by 30%.Microsoft said Apple’s plan prevents it from steering users toward Microsoft-owned payment platforms “where it could offer better promotions, discounts, or ways to manage their subscriptions.”Apple’s new proposed commission structure would eat into the revenue of independent content creators, said X. And Match Group said Apple’s proposal “will impact many thousands of other developers and their millions of users, frustrating the injunction’s purpose.”In January, Apple said it would change its app store terms so that apps could include “buttons or links with calls to action that direct customers to” ways to pay for in-app content other than those controlled by Apple.According to Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group, however, the details of Apple’s plan lead to an outcome that is not much different than the status quo.For example, Wednesday’s brief said, Apple’s proposal, which requires app developers to apply for permission to link out to other payment systems, still imposes restrictions “that dictate every aspect” of how apps can communicate with their users. And although Apple agreed to lower its 30% app store commission as part of the plan, the new fee is still 27%.“This alone functionally renders external links ineffective as a means of directing customers to alternative payment options, and directly undermines the Court’s goal of creating price competition,” the filing said.Under the way that Apple’s new terms are written, app makers would also still be prohibited from sending customers to third-party websites such as PayPal to complete transactions, the companies added.On Wednesday, Apple suggested that nothing in the court’s order prohibited it from designing the proposal the way it did.Apple referred CNN to portions of its January filing in which the company had pointed out: “The Court stated it would not ‘micromanage’ the new framework,” and that Apple would be structuring the new terms to safeguard user security and privacy.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/meta-microsoft-x-match-group-220721901.html
2024-03-20 22:02:13+00:00,8 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying,"In this article, we will list the 8 best AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying. If you want to skip our discussion about smart trackers, go to the 3 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying. Smart Bluetooth Trackers like Apple's AirTags are emerging as pivotal components in an era of technological advancements. The market is expected to experience an impressive cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. It was valued at $583 million in 2021 and is expected to reach a market size of $1,655 million by 2030. It is worth noting that smart trackers are a part of the much larger Internet of Things (IoT) market. The IoT market, as a whole, is experiencing even higher growth and is expected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. Its growth is driven by automation, big data demand, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Some of the factors influencing the growth of smart trackers include the rising number of smartphone owners. However, growth will be primarily driven by high-end phone users such as those of Apple's iPhones and Samsung's flagship phones. AirTag was launched with the motive of preventing the stealing and misplacing of iPhones. It was introduced as an accessory that works with Apple's Find My app to help users keep track of and find things that are important to them. However, users have found various uses for AirTags and other Bluetooth smart trackers, including pet surveillance. While the smart tracker market is on a trajectory of growth, it has significant challenges ahead of it. There are concerns over privacy, data security, and technological obsolescence. A host of legal issues are being raised, which might shift the regulatory environment against them. More recently, an attempted class action lawsuit against Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is being allowed to proceed because the judge was convinced that there are negligence issues surrounding the AirTags trackers. However, since leading tech companies have already invested quite alot in their smart trackers, they are ready to take proactive measures and innovations to address these challenges. Devices like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags epitomize the fusion of innovation and utility. These Bluetooth smart trackers employ an array of technologies, including GPS, WiFi, RFID, and cellular networks to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring and location tracking. Currently, the market is headed towards improving the ecosystem and app enhancement. Companies opening in the industry are building comprehensive ecosystems around their tracking devices, which go a mile or two beyond basic tracking. Creating and implementing a perfect ecosystem often involves the use of numerous technologies, including geofencing capabilities, crowd-sourced location tracking, and integration with other smartphone and IoT devices. Other trends prevalent in the market include a multi-technology approach and a focus on power efficiency and battery life. Most smart trackers today combine GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFI to ensure robust and efficient tracking solutions. In addition, manufacturers are now prioritizing extended battery life through efficient designs and optimized usage patterns. Some of the key players in the market include Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL), Tile, and Samsung. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags leads the market and are still the most popular type of tracking device. However, these can only be used with iPhones, which is why it is worth having a look at the best AirTag alternatives if you are an Android user. Tille is another prominent company that specializes in Bluetooth trackers for personal belongings. On the other hand, Samsung leverages its global presence to offer diverse smart tracking solutions.Before diving into the list of the best AirTag alternatives, it is worth knowing how smart trackers and AirTag work. These trackers utilize a blend of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) to track personal belongings. In the case of AirTag, it sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that nearby devices can detect within the Find My network. These devices then send the location of AirTag into the owner's iCloud. While this is a smart approach, it also has a drawback as an AirTag needs an iPhone nearby to function. With that backdrop, let's look at the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying. To curate our list of the 8 best AppleAirtag alternatives that are actually worth buying, we devised an original methodology. First, we went to online forums to understand what people actually want in their smart trackers, and we boiled it down to the following factors: battery life, Bluetooth tracking range, affordability, and protection. After looking at several smart trackers and their features, we devised a point system. For battery life, we awarded 2 points to trackers that last a couple of days, 4 points to those that last a couple of weeks, and 5 points to those that last more than a month. For tracking range, we awarded 2 points for 10 meters or less, 3 points for 11 meters to 60 meters, 4 points for 61 to 100 meters, and 5 points for more than 100 meters range. For affordability, we awarded 3 points to trackers that cost more than $40, 4 points to those that cost less than $40 but more than $25, and 5 points to those that cost less than $25. For protection, we awarded 2 points to those that came with no protection, 3 points to weather resistant, 4 points to water resistant, and 5 points to waterproof trackers. Then, for each tracker, we summed the total and averaged it to arrive at the Insider Monkey Rating. The higher this rating, the higher the tracker ranked on our list. As tie breakers, we used tracking range, battery life, and affordability in order. For all the points awarded, we tried to refer to user experience rather than the company's claim. It is worth noting that one of the trackers in our list is a pet collar, which we included because AirTags are sometimes used for pet surveillance.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

2024-03-20 21:42:07+00:00,Justice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday,"(Bloomberg) — The Justice Department is poised to sue Apple Inc. as soon as Thursday, accusing the world’s second most valuable tech company of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamSam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondFed to Give Fresh Clues on Path of Interest-Rate CutsUltra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite NeighborhoodThe suit, which is expected to be filed in federal court, according to people familiar with the matter, escalates the Biden administration’s antitrust fights against most of the biggest US technology giants. The Justice Department is already suing Alphabet Inc.’s Google for monopolization, while the Federal Trade Commission is pursuing antitrust cases against Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Apple and the Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The people familiar asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.Apple shares fell as much as 1.4% to $176.10 in late trading on the news. They had been down 7.2% this year through Wednesday’s close.The coming case will mark the third time that the Justice Department has sued Apple for antitrust violations in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position.The lawsuit comes as Apple also is coming under increasing scrutiny in Europe over alleged anticompetitive behavior. The company was hit with a €1.8 billion fine this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. Apple’s appealing the penalty and has said that regulators failed to uncover any “credible evidence of consumer harm.”Meanwhile, the company may face a full-blown investigation under the EU’s new rules for Big Tech — the Digital Markets Act — which went into force earlier this month. Rivals have dinged new App Store rules that came into force in Europe, complaining that changes are likely to result in higher prices for developers. Penalties for failing to comply with the EU’s new rules can be severe - as much as 10% of a company’s annual worldwide revenue or up to 20% for repeat offenders.The Justice Department opened the latest case in 2019 under former President Donald Trump. The antitrust division, though, chose to prioritize twin cases against Google, taking a back seat as Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. sued Apple for monopolization in 2020 and that case worked its way through the federal courts.—With assistance from Samuel Stolton.(Updates with shares, additional details.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionSelling Shohei Ohtani: Can Baseball’s Biggest Talent Transform the Sport?China’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American BuyersJulius Baer Hits Reboot to Escape Swiss Banking’s New MalaiseOpenAI Sprinting to Keep Up With Startups on AI-Generated Video©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/justice-department-sue-apple-antitrust-212239046.html

It also decided against hearing Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law.Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing. The company is based in Cupertino, California, while Epic is based in Cary, North Carolina.The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/meta-microsoft-x-match-join-210220149.html

2024-03-20 15:56:00+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Adds New Feature to Google Maps for Wear OS,"Alphabet’s GOOGL Google added a new Transit feature to Google Maps for Wear OS, offering users public transit directions.Notably, this Transit option for location searches works with Wear OS Tile for quick travel, providing an ETA after driving, walking and biking.Further, users can access a live map view, zoomed-out map view and exit icon on the watch face when selecting a route in Google Maps.The latest move will likely boost the adoption of Wear OS. Moreover, the company is expected to gain solid traction across smartwatch users on the back of this new feature.This, in turn, will enable Alphabet to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global smartwatch market. Per an EMR report, the global smartwatch market is expected to be valued at $160.67 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 15.6% between 2024 and 2032.Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteApart from the latest feature for Wear OS, the company also announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map. This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.Further, Google added ""glanceable directions"" for Maps on Android and iOS, providing live ETAs and directions on the device's lock screen, using regular system notifications.The company has also updated Google Maps on Android Auto to display estimated drive time in a bolder font, similar to other platforms. The bolder number, now displayed alongside thinner minutes and hour indicators, is available in version 11.119.0100 of Google Maps and version 11.5 of Android Auto.All the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital map market.

Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.48 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.Strengthening Google Maps offerings will aid Alphabet to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which have positioned themselves well in the digital map space.Apple is riding on the success of its Apple Maps offerings.Apple’s launch of Apple Business Connect, a free tool enabling businesses to manage their location place cards and customize information for over a billion users on Apple Maps, including adding photos, logos and promotions, remains noteworthy.Meanwhile, Microsoft is enjoying the growing momentum of Bing Maps with new feature updates.Microsoft introduced live traffic updates on Bing Maps, enabling users to plan their journeys more efficiently by providing real-time information about traffic conditions during commutes.Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

2024-03-20 15:23:25+00:00,Google becomes the first AI company to be fined over training data,"Nearly five years ago, I reported on how France’s news publishers had gone to war with Google over the issue of “ancillary copyright” fees—payments for including snippets of article text in Google’s search results. I wrote that the media houses were unlikely to win. Well, they just did. And as with everything else these days, AI suddenly became part of the equation.This morning, the French competition authority fined Google €250 million ($271 million) for failing to comply with commitments it made a couple years ago regarding how it would negotiate the fees with the French news outlets. Google already received a €500 million fine over the matter in 2021. It’s not arguing back this time, which has probably spared it an even higher fine.I’m not going to go into the details of the revised negotiation process to which Google has agreed—it’s as dull as it sounds and, if you really want to dive in, here’s Google’s statement in French and English. The interesting part of this episode is about Google’s Bard AI, which these days goes by the name of Gemini.As far as I’m aware, this is the first fine to be levied on an AI company at least partially because of its free-wheeling incorporation of everything it can grab into its training data.According to the French Competition Authority (FCA) the fine takes account of the fact that Google “used content from press agencies and publishers to train its [Bard] foundation model, without notifying either them or the [FCA].”As Google tells it, the FCA “does not challenge the way web content is used to improve newer products like generative AI.” Google claimed this issue is “already addressed” in Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive, which provides an exception for text and data mining, and in the upcoming EU AI Act, which tells AI companies to respect the Copyright Directive (and to publish “sufficiently detailed” summaries of their training data).But according to the FCA, the question of whether article-scraping AI companies qualify for that text and data mining exception “has not yet been settled.” It said Google had “at the very least” broken its commitment to be transparent in its commercial dealings with French news publishers, making this a fining matter.Now, Google did recently launch a new control in the robots.txt file that web publishers use to send signals to Google’s web crawlers. The setting is called Google-Extended, and it’s supposed to let publishers opt out of having their data become Bard/Gemini training fodder without also having their articles disappear from Google Search and Google News.But it only added that control at the end of September, more than two months after Bard’s European launch. During that period, French publishers effectively had to allow the unrestricted hoovering of their output into Bard if they also wanted it to appear in Search and News—which, remember, is how they then get to claim ancillary copyright fees from Google. That broke another of Google’s commitments, again contributing to today’s fine. The FCA also told Google to explain to publishers how the opt-out mechanism works.So in summary, Google’s new control for publishers has belatedly fixed one of the issues with the unpaid incorporation of news articles into its AI training material, but the overall legality of this practice under EU copyright law remains an open question. It’s not hard to see why Google's big rival, OpenAI, has started cutting licensing deals with European press publishers like Axel Springer and Le Monde.One final note while we’re on the subject of Big Tech and European antitrust regulators: Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition chief, just told Reuters that Apple may face a probe over the €0.50-per-app-installation “core technology fee” it’s levying on developers who dare to use the third-party iOS app stores that Apple must allow under the new EU Digital Markets Act. “There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA,” she said.Given that Microsoft and Meta have both complained to Vestager that the fee makes third-party app stores unviable, there’s a storm a-coming, and I do not hate to say I told you so.

2024-03-20 14:23:00+00:00,"This Growth Stock Is Beating the ""Magnificent Seven"": Should You Buy?","The ""Magnificient Seven"" stocks have dominated the market since the start of 2023. Leading the broad indices to new highs, these seven companies -- all of which have had a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion at some point -- have become the backbone of the modern stock market. Businesses like Alphabet and Apple have demolished most of their competitors, such as Yahoo and Blackberry.Investors might think it is impossible to compete with the Magnificent Seven tech stocks at this point. But that is not the case in every sector. Enter Spotify (NYSE: SPOT). The leading music and audio streaming service has blazed its own path worldwide despite major competition from the likes of Apple, YouTube, and others. With the stock up 222% since the start of 2023, is now the perfect time to hop on the Spotify growth train?Spotify is well-known for its audio streaming application. It allows users to play any music from around the world -- along with podcasts and audiobooks -- with only an internet connection. To make money, Spotify charges users a monthly subscription to access music without advertisements, along with a few other features. This is where the majority of its $14.4 billion in annual revenue comes from today. Since going public in 2018, Spotify's revenue is up 209% in U.S. dollars. Since 2015, its premium subscribers have grown from 28 million to 236 million.It has done so despite intense competition from Apple and YouTube (which is owned by technology conglomerate Alphabet). Apple released Apple Music in 2015, which was a copycat of Spotify's service. It has since reached an estimated 100 million paying users, while Spotify has added 200 million paying users. YouTube Music now has an estimated 100 million paying users as well. While both competing services are sizable, it is remarkable that Spotify is still winning, considering both Apple's and YouTube's services are bundled with other products at a heavy discount to Spotify.These companies also own the two distribution platforms for Spotify's service: the IOS and Android mobile operating systems. Spotify has claimed for years that both Apple and Alphabet have acted anticompetitively by prioritizing their own applications over Spotify's on their respective mobile app stores. Now, governments are starting to agree.Earlier this year, the European Union fined Apple $2 billion for specific anticompetitive behavior against music streaming services (meaning Spotify). Despite Apple and Alphabet both trying to cripple Spotify's business, it continues to thrive. I think that shows how powerful a service it is in consumers' eyes.Spotify has always grown quickly but without generating a profit. Investors soured on the business in 2022 as management once again pushed out profits to future years. Now, it looks like the year of profits is finally arriving.The company has gone through major layoffs after hiring too many people in 2020 and 2021 while also trying to eliminate redundant costs across its business operations. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Spotify would have generated a positive operating profit if you excluded its one-time severance costs.The business keeps growing, even with fewer employees. I think this means profits are probable in 2024. Margins keep moving higher, and revenue is still growing at a double-digit rate (16% year over year in Q4, for example). Over the long term, management expects the business will hit 10% or higher profit margins, given its unit economics. These aren't the sky-high margins you might see at other technology companies, but after 2024, it will be hard to claim that Spotify has an unviable business model.After its massive run-up, Spotify now sports a healthy market capitalization of $50 billion. Assuming it can reach a 10% profit margin in the next few years, its $14.4 billion in revenue would turn into $1.44 billion in earnings. That gives the stock a (theoretical) price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35, a significant premium to the market average.With Spotify's premium P/E multiple, investors need to expect the company to grow quickly to fulfill its current valuation -- and Spotify is doing just that, with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in 2023. There is still plenty of room for the music streaming market to grow worldwide, with the company making large pushes into podcasts and audiobooks to drive further gains.If Spotify can keep growing revenue at a healthy rate, the stock still looks reasonably valued at these prices. Don't be afraid to buy shares just because it is up over 200% since the start of 2023.Should you invest $1,000 in Spotify Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Spotify Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Spotify Technology wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-20 13:48:24+00:00,IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 as AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamWhat Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondFed to Give Fresh Clues on Path of Interest-Rate CutsUltra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite NeighborhoodSam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’International Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM’s roughly 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.“IBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,” said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm’s cash flow generation and “healthy” dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.Much of the year’s advance followed IBM’s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday.The surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM’s 82% gain over the same period.Wall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM’s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.Still, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.That hasn’t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM’s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company’s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.“The CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “We can easily do better elsewhere.”Tech Chart of the DayIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year as of its last close, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook arrived in China on Wednesday touting the country’s importance as a market and production base, reaching out to Chinese consumers who may be souring on the maker of iPhones.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamWhat Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondFed to Give Fresh Clues on Path of Interest-Rate CutsUltra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite NeighborhoodSam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to the company than China’s, Cook told the Global Times in an interview tweeted by the newspaper. Apple’s been expanding its base in the country and increasing investment over the past 30 years, he added.Cook’s comments, ahead of Thursday’s launch of Apple’s eighth store in Shanghai, come as the “symbiotic” relationship between the company and China as he once described is showing signs of fraying.Anchored by Foxconn, or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple’s manufacturing presence in China has been broad and unshakable for over two decades. But the company has suffered snags in production in recent years due to a US and China trade war and Covid-triggered factory closures, delaying launches of products.Apple is now diversifying its operations away from China by working with assembly and component manufacturing partners in India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere.Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to China: QuickTakeRead More: Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales PlungeDemand for its products in China is also cooling.Phone sales plunged 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to research firm Counterpoint. Apple has been losing market share to US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co., which has benefited from a wave of patriotic buying for its homegrown Mate 60 Pro devices.The upcoming Shanghai store adds to Apple’s biggest retail network outside the US and is part of a broader effort to grow and revitalize the company’s brick-and-mortar outlets. China remains a vital market for the company with the world’s largest smartphone consumer base and potential for growing sales of accessories like the Apple Watch.Apple’s apparent vote of confidence for China is no less important to Xi Jinping’s government. With the economy slowing, new foreign direct investment falling and multinationals looking to other markets for growth, it’s important to show the world China is still open for business in the wake of regulatory crackdowns and national security concerns that have spooked foreign investors.Cook posted a video of himself on walking around Shanghai with Chinese actor Zheng Kai. In a Weibo clip seen by half a million people within minutes of posting, Cook crossed a bridge near the historic Bund, sampled soup dumplings in a local restaurant and said “hello” in the Shanghainese dialect.Born and raised in Shanghai, Zheng is one of China’s most famous TV and movie stars.

2024-03-20 08:54:00+00:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple, Alphabet, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Viking Therapeutics","Chicago, IL – March 20, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Eli Lilly LLY, Novo Nordisk NVO and Viking Therapeutics VKTX.We live in a world where almost all Americans own Apple smartphones and where you can instantaneously find almost any information in the world via Alphabet's Google. Humans (& Americans in particular) often seek quick fixes due to a combination of factors such as impatience, convenience, and a desire for immediate gratification.This tendency is deeply ingrained in human nature and is evident across various aspects of life including health. Quick fixes offer the allure of rapid solutions to complex or challenging problems, promising instant relief or improvement without the need for sustained effort.The explosion of processed foods containing unhealthy fats or addictive sweeteners has led to a worldwide obesity epidemic. Obesity levels have increased by 300% over the past 50 years according to the World Health Organization (WHO)! Meanwhile, the World Obesity Atlas predicts that the trend will only worsen, with more than half the world’s population overweight in the next decade.There are two presumable fixes to obesity – eat healthier/exercise, or take an injection drug. Obviously, the second option is controversial. However, many overweight people desperate to lose weight are choosing to go in that direction. According to Goldman SachsResearch, “Earlier this year, the global market for anti-obesity medications (AOMs) reached $6 billion on an annualized basis. By 2030, it could grow by more than 16 times to $100 billion.”Biotech powerhouses Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are the first massive winners in the space and have sparked the weight loss treatment revolution. However, on February 27th, Viking Therapeutics shares more than doubled in a single session after receiving Phase 2 trial for its new injectable weight loss drug. Though LLY and NVO have proven to be big winners and likely will continue to be, I VKTX has much more upside for the following reasons:VKTX showed 13% weight loss over a 13-week treatment (with no plateau), while LLY and NVO took much longer (32-48 weeks) to achieve slightly better results (15-20% fat loss). In addition, VKTX saw fewer side effects than its competitors. According to Phase 2 results, VKTX had only a 17% nausea rate (compared to 30-45% for LLY & NVO)Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly each have a market cap north of $500 billion, while Viking has a market cap of just $7 billion. Because the industry has so much upside, VKTX is an obvious takeout target.After exploding on positive results, VKTX is consolidating uniformly and is testing its gap low – an area likely to find buyers.Furthermore, VKTX has unusual options activity, with a flurry of buyers of April 90 calls.A rising obesity rate and the desire for a quick fix are driving the burgeoning weight loss industry. VKTX stands to benefit the most.Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

2024-03-20 01:46:02+00:00,Apple-Google Gemini Partnership Could Make an Unstoppable AI Force,"Google’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), shot higher yesterday, finishing the day up 4.6%, following a Bloomberg report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to Google Gemini as the AI integrated into the iPhone. Indeed, a potential Apple-Google Gemini partnership in artificial intelligence (AI) could mirror their deal with search, which was the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny in recent years.And while a Google-Apple AI partnership is sure to draw the ire of antitrust regulators, I see the move as a potentially massive win for both companies as they seek to gain (further) in the AI race.With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the charge on generative AI with its OpenAI stake, Apple must find a way to make up for lost time on the AI front. Teaming up with Google is a way to catch up with industry leaders like Microsoft. Also, it may be a straightforward way to pull ahead as Apple gains access to one of the most potent large language models (LLMs), Google Gemini. Given this, I remain bullish on both AAPL and GOOGL.While I’m sure Apple could incorporate its own LLM into its devices, I think Google is the better option at this early phase in the AI boom. Why? As good as LLMs have become in recent quarters, they’re still not immune from hallucinating (making stuff up, seemingly out of the blue).Only time will tell when we have a robust, hallucination-free LLM ready for the market. Regardless, given Apple’s history of releasing polished products that are truly ready for takeoff, I just don’t see Apple putting itself out there with a work-in-progress type of LLM product.As capable and impressive as they are, even the latest versions of Google Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo are technically works in progress, at least in my opinion.Neither LLM is perfect, especially at this point in the AI lifecycle, when hallucinations still happen regularly. My guess is it could take a while before LLMs are polished enough that mistakes become incredibly rare (or maybe virtually impossible).Perhaps we may be a few quarters or even a few years away from the error-free AI that many of us envision as a sort of holy grail in AI. Given how fast generative AI technologies are advancing (think exponential, not linear, rates), though, maybe hallucination-free LLMs are a heck of a lot closer than many of us may think.For now, I think the masses have come to accept that the occasional hiccup is bound to happen when using even the best LLM that exists today. Users of such LLMs can simply check the sources themselves to ensure they’re not on the receiving end of a hallucination. Indeed, fact-checking can be a bit of a hassle when using LLMs like Gemini or GPT-4, but it’s a relatively small compromise. Further, it’s between that and using an old-fashioned search engine.I don’t think Apple has anything to really gain by rushing an LLM product to market right now, especially given that today’s LLMs are prone to errors, negative headlines, lawsuits, public outrage, and all sorts of negativity.When the perfect time comes (perhaps when LLMs have a bit more polish), though, I think Apple could have the option to replace Google Gemini with its own LLM, just like when it gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot from Mac devices when it was ready to launch on the back of its very own Apple Silicon.In these early stages of the AI boom, Apple stands to benefit from all the positives of AI by using Gemini without having to deal with the downsides. If something goes awry, it’s the Gemini LLM, not Apple, that’s to blame. In the meantime, look for Alphabet to gain traction as Gemini introduces itself to Apple’s golden install base, which is billions of users strong.Indeed, Gemini in iPhone could ultimately help Google and Apple surpass Microsoft in the LLM race. It will be interesting to see how a potential Google-Apple partnership evolves. Nevertheless, if any deal is inked, I expect that GOOGL stock could face a considerable valuation multiple expansion, perhaps one closer to that of its top AI peer, MSFT stock, even if Alphabet is forced to pay Apple a hefty sum.Even after surging 4.6% in a day, GOOGL stock still seems to have room to run at just 25.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) if it’s to catch up to MSFT stock’s 37.7 times trailing P/E multiple.Alphabet stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Alphabet stock price target of $165.09 implies 12.3% upside potential.Apple stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target of $204.86 implies 16.3% upside potential.It seems like a Google-Apple Gemini AI deal would be a win for both firms in a bid to pull ahead in the generative AI race. It’s important to note, however, that all we have is a report from Bloomberg about potential talks between the two companies.The chatter about the chatter means that nothing is set in stone yet, even though recent market action suggests a dotted line has already been signed. In any case, look for Apple to go on the hunt for an AI partner as it seeks a “backstop” in this still-early (and less-than-polished) stage of generative AI.Disclosure",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-google-gemini-partnership-could-014602633.html

2024-03-19 18:34:35+00:00,Judge denies Apple's attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit over AirTag stalking,"NEW YORK (AP) — A judge has denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that stalkers are using its AirTag devices to track victims — and that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent them.Apple’s $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from their lost keys to wallets and luggage. But stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar products to follow individuals without their consent.In December 2022, Apple was sued by dozens of plaintiffs who said they were stalked by AirTag users. They alleged that Apple failed to mitigate such dangers and should have done more to protect victims — claiming AirTags “revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking” and that current safety features are inadequate.Apple attempted to dismiss the litigation in a filing last year, arguing the company “took proactive steps to try to deter misuse” and that it should not bear liability for injuries caused by third parties. But San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed that motion on Friday.Chhabria ruled that, while most of the class-action plaintiffs' claims were “inadequately pled,"" three can proceed for negligence and strict product liability under California law. The remaining claims were dismissed in a separate order.“Apple may ultimately be right that California law did not require it to do more to diminish the ability of stalkers to use AirTags effectively, but that determination cannot be made at this early stage,"" Chhabria wrote.Chhabria detailed arguments from both Apple and the plaintiffs in the ruling. Included were accounts from the three remaining claims of victims being stalked by former partners or others through AirTags that were allegedly attached to their cars, resulting in emotional and sometimes financial harm.All three of these cases involve “purported defects” of AirTags that made it harder for the victims to both understand the tracking and quickly stop it, Friday's ruling outlines, including unclear or delayed notifications, as well as an inability to disable the devices remotely, which allegedly prolonged stalking.“We’re grateful for the opportunity to continue this critical litigation,” Gillian L. Wade, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press via email. “Abusive and dangerous location tracking is only becoming more common, so it’s imperative to do everything we can to give voice to the victims, and to push for accountability and change.”Apple and attorneys representing the California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.Back in February 2022, months ahead of the class action filing, Apple released a statement that said it “condemn(s) in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products."" It also noted then-planned updates aimed at increasing safety.Last year, Apple also partnered with Google to submit a proposal aimed at setting standards for combatting secret surveillance on AirTags and similar gadgets.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/judge-denies-apples-attempt-dismiss-183435295.html
2024-03-19 17:59:44+00:00,I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.,"The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.According to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).But as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.How can I say such a thing?It’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.Back then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.Why were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.So people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.These days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst.One of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)Two months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.Then the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.Ultimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.Even one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.Barring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.But, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?The S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?I don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term.Amazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.And now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.Nvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)The point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.Look. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.But what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.There may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years?

2024-03-19 14:07:00+00:00,Prediction: Nvidia Will Become the World's Largest Company. Here's Why.,"Let's cut right to the chase: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on track to become the world's largest company. Think that's going too far? I don't. Here's why.As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest American company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.Company NameSymbolMarket Cap (in billions)MicrosoftMSFT$3,094AppleAAPL$2,665NvidiaNVDA$2,195AmazonAMZN$1,811AlphabetGOOG$1,761That puts it 'only' $500 billion behind Apple and about $1 trillion behind Microsoft. To put it another way, Nvidia could surpass Apple if its stock were to rally by 23%; it could pass Microsoft if it rallied by 46%.Why do I think this will happen? Two words come to mind: Artificial Intelligence (AI). In short, the world has gone head-over-heels for AI. Consider this chart below:According to Statista, the overall Generative AI market stood at $44.9 billion in 2023. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to $207 billion. Generative AI, which can create images, stories, music, and video, is already upending entire industries. Marketing, software design, and customer service are just a few sectors likely to be transformed over the next decade as generative AI products grow in popularity.In short, Nvidia stands to profit from the AI revolution more than any other company, thanks to its leading share of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market. GPUs are the 'brains' behind cutting-edge AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. And to build those brains, companies like OpenAI need tens of thousands of GPUs -- often designed by Nvidia.To sum up, thanks to its commanding place in the GPU market, I think Nvidia can ride the AI wave to the top of the list of most valuable companies in the world.

2024-03-19 11:30:00+00:00,"Amid Rumors of a Deal With Rivian, Apple Acquired This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Start-Up Instead","From time to time, companies pursue mergers or acquisitions to help fund growth. These deals can help source product innovation or spearhead entering a new market.One company that has historically chosen to build in-house over pursuing acquisitions is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Most of the company's deals have been under-the-radar transactions, with very few making the headlines.But earlier this month news broke that Apple was abandoning its ambitions in electric vehicles (EV). Shortly thereafter, rumors started to spread that Apple might be interested in acquiring Rivian. While this was an intriguing postulation, I see it as unlikely.Why? Because Apple just acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up called DarwinAI instead.Although Apple is notoriously secretive, I think this move sheds some light on where the company wants to go. Let's dig into the deal and assess the breadcrumbs Apple has dropped as it pertains to its AI vision.Last year marked the start of the AI revolution. Microsoft kicked things off with its investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Amazon and Alphabet both swiftly followed, with each investing in a competing platform called Anthropic.For these tech behemoths, the aggressive moves within the AI realm were obvious. Each of these companies offer leading cloud-computing platforms, and integrating AI with those applications should help foster new growth.On the hardware side of the AI race lies Nvidia. The company's high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are fueling breakthroughs in generative AI -- from large language models (LLMs) to accelerated computing.Apple stands out among its ""Magnificent Seven"" cohorts, as the company operates across both the software and hardware industries. I'd argue that Microsoft is the biggest threat to Apple in this regard, with Nvidia showing signs of making inroads as well.But with all of this said, Apple remained pretty quiet last year as it relates to AI.Over the last couple of years, inflation played a major role influencing consumer spending habits. As such, demand for Apple's luxury hardware devices stalled. This dynamic has taken a major toll on Apple's growth, as revenue has been on the decline for several consecutive quarters. But with over $70 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, coupled with a budding services business, it was only a matter of time before Apple made a public splash in AI.DarwinAI develops technology which aims to help production quality. Its visual AI inspection technology can identify defects in products during the manufacturing cycle.Unlike its cohorts above, Apple is heavily reliant on devices -- not on the cloud. Given that the company has already released a new line of MacBook Air this year and very well could be planning on releasing additional enhancements to its software operating system, Apple's interest in DarwinAI's technology becomes more clear.Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 26, materially higher than that of the S&P 500. Considering the company isn't growing, and it clearly moved much slower than its peers in the AI space, I think Apple stock might be too expensive at the moment.For now, DarwinAI presents an intriguing new part of Apple's ecosystem. And while DarwinAI's technology has the potential to help Apple hone its production quality, the bigger question is whether it will serve as a way to help integrate AI across the hardware line more efficiently.It's simply too hard to know what kind of impact DarwinAI will have on Apple until the company starts to roll out specific AI features. Given Apple's premium valuation, I'd pass right now in favor of other opportunities in the AI space that have already established a clear vision.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 10:37:00+00:00,"Apple and Google Could Team Up on Generative AI. Here's Why Both ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Would Likely Win From a Deal.","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google are textbook examples of ""frenemies."" The two tech giants compete against each other in the smartphone market with Apple's iPhones going head to head with Google's Android phones. However, Apple and Google also work together with iPhones using Google Search as their default search engine.Now it looks like the two companies might be teaming up again, this time on generative AI. Here's why both ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks would likely win from a deal.Bloomberg reported on Monday that Apple was in discussions with Google to use its Gemini large language model (LLM) in upcoming iPhones. Google unveiled Gemini in December 2023, calling the LLM ""our largest most capable AI model"" yet. Gemini comes in three sizes: Ultra (the most powerful version used in Google's subscription plans), Pro (which powers the free version), and Nano (used on mobile devices).Neither Apple nor Google have commented publicly on the news that they're in talks. Bloomberg cited ""people familiar with the situation"" as the source for its scoop.The timing of Bloomberg's report is interesting. The article about a potential collaboration comes on the heels of Apple's release of a report last week describing its work on developing MM1, a family of multimodal LLMs designed to use up to 30 billion parameters.Apple didn't trumpet its research on MM1, however. The company quietly published its report on Arxiv, a website for preprints and post-prints of research papers. Also, Apple hasn't made MM1 available for testing by outside parties.Alphabet stock jumped more than 6% in early trading on Monday after the Bloomberg story broke. That's not surprising. Should Apple license Gemini, it would be a major boost for Google's AI credentials.More importantly, any deal would almost certainly make Alphabet a lot of money. Deepwater Asset Management co-founder Gene Munster posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that licensing Gemini to Apple could add between 1% and 2% to Alphabet's total revenue.The consensus Wall Street estimate is for Alphabet to generate revenue of $342 billion this year. Using the high end of Munster's range, a licensing agreement with Apple could boost Alphabet's revenue by more than $6.8 billion. The overall financial impact for Alphabet could be even greater if the company leveraged the public relations value of an Apple deal to attract clients to build their AI apps on Google Cloud using Gemini.Apple investors also liked the idea of using Gemini in iPhones. Shares of the world's second-largest company rose more than 2% in early trading on Monday.While Google and others have made big splashes in generative AI, Apple has appeared to be left behind. Incorporating Gemini into the iOS operating system used to power iPhones and iPads could enable the company to roll out generative AI functionality more quickly than waiting for its own LLMs to be ready.Investors shouldn't begin celebrating just yet, though. Bloomberg stated that Apple and Google ""haven't decided the terms or branding of an AI agreement or finalized how it would be implemented."" As anyone following the technology industry knows, the devil is in the details of major licensing deals such as the one that's reportedly being negotiated.Also, Bloomberg revealed that Apple has talked with OpenAI about using its GPT-4 AI model in iPhones. It seems possible that OpenAI could be a backup plan if Apple's discussions with Google break down. Apple could also use the threat of potentially using GPT-4 as a negotiating tool in obtaining a lower price from Google.Still, the mere fact that Apple and Google are reportedly in active discussions about a generative AI deal is big for both companies. These two frenemies just might soon move the needle more to the friends side than the enemies side.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 09:36:00+00:00,"This Is the Cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric","There's been a lot of talk about the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.But their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.How to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.The PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.To calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.A PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.One standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.Here's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.CompanyPEG RatioMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)1.10Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)1.36Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)1.49Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)1.93Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)2.11Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)2.12Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)2.36Data source: Yahoo! Finance.There are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other ""disruptive"" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, ""mature"" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.Still, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.In addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its ""Other Bets"" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.And of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.One big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term.Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.However, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.Moreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived ""safety"" in good economic environments and bad.Microsoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.On the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.Amazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's ""other bets,"" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.Meanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.The combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.The PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.Moreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.Overall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.While the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” Huang added in a press release.Nvidia has an 80% share of the data centre AI chip market and hopes to cement its dominance with this latest chip.The company is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple.Apple is discussing a potential deal to integrate Google’s (GOOG) artificial intelligence platform Gemini into the iPhone, Bloomberg reported.Apple is holding “active negotiations” to license Gemini’s AI models to integrate its generative AI features into an upcoming software update to the iPhone later this year.Apple’s models could power on-device generative AI with iOS 18, releasing later this year, while cloud-based AI features like text- and image-generation could come via partnerships with the likes of Google.""Given Apple's installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices, a licensing deal based on volume of usage could end up being a very significant cost for Apple but a fixed license for any cloud-based usage would not be economical for partners,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said.“An on-device fixed charge per device seems most likely but would be more limited in capabilities. Apple could also use this as an approach to speed up time to market, while continuing to develop in-house technologies,” he added.Unilever has warned that up to 7,500 jobs are at risk as the Magnum maker outlined plans to split off its ice cream unit as a separate business.This overhaul is primarily aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years. The plan will separate its ice cream businesses and divide the rest of Unilever into four divisions: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care and Nutrition.The FTSE 100 consumer goods giant said it was accelerating its “growth action plan” which will make it a “simpler, more focused company”.Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Action is what shareholders wanted to see from the new team at the top, and that’s what’s been delivered today.“Ice cream always looked like the odd one out when you compare it to other product lines, and performance has struggled of late.Read more: AI could spark 'complete annihilation of humankind' unless regulated“It’s not a huge shock to see this move, but it’s something prior management wasn’t able to deliver.“Unilever’s not an overly expensive name at the minute so expect markets to react positively to the news, perhaps more due to the decisive action than anything else.”According to the group, any impacted staff members will be consulted about the job cuts but did not reveal whereabouts they will be made.AstraZeneca has acquired oncology biotech Fusion Pharmaceuticals for $2.4bn as part of a plan to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer treatments.Canadian biotech Fusion, whose shares trade in New York, is involved in radiopharmaceuticals, a rapidly growing area of cancer treatment that targets specific organs, tissues or cells within the human body.""The acquisition marks a major step forward in AstraZeneca delivering on its ambition to transform cancer treatment and outcomes for patients by replacing traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments,"" said AstraZeneca.The deal involves a $2bn upfront cash transaction, with a total transaction value of $2.4bn based on contingent, further payments.

2024-03-19 09:00:02+00:00,Companies are getting back control of their companies,"Companies are getting bolder in their battles to beat back proposals requiring them to disclose more about everything from environmental policies to artificial intelligence as shareholder support for governance changes shows new signs of waning in 2024.So far this year, Apple (AAPL), Tyson Foods (TSN), and Applied Materials (AMAT) have defeated proposals that would have required the giants to disclose more about diversity, ESG, labor practices, and AI policies.Exxon (XOM) is suing two activist investor groups — Arjuna Capital and Follow This — after the organizations tried to bring a shareholder vote on whether the oil giant should disclose greenhouse gas emissions.And the Securities and Exchange Commission watered down a new set of climate-risk disclosure rules after companies complained about the costs of compiling indirect emissions. The Chamber of Commerce, along with fossil fuel companies and industry groups as well as Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, prevailed in a request to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals asking the court to put the rules the SEC did pass on hold while a petition against the measure plays out.The bolder action by big businesses comes as political heat around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies mount in an election year.Former President Trump has promised to banish ESG ""forever,"" while a top Trump ally has called DEI ""bigotry"" against white men.Republican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.Big asset managers and Wall Street banks that own giant slugs of stock in major American companies are contributing to the retreat.The latest retrenchment came last month when financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), State Street (STT), and Pimco all pulled out of Climate Action 100+, a coalition formed in 2017 to encourage companies to reduce their emissions.BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest money manager, also ended its US involvement with the group.A key test of these issues is taking place this spring, as companies collect votes on a variety of proposals seeking changes to corporate governance. So far this year, stockholders are saying 'no' to many of them.Apple shareholders roundly rejected a collection of ethics- and employment-centered initiatives, turning down a labor-backed proposal from AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund (AFLCIX) that suggested the iPhone maker report how it uses AI technology in its business operations.Other failed initiatives pushed for Apple to report more detailed information on racial and gender pay gaps and the evenness of its application of human rights policies around the globe.Even a proposal that sought to protect conservative views from discrimination lacked enough support to pass. It would have required Apple to disclose potential risks from its omission of ""viewpoint"" and ""ideology"" discrimination in its employment policy.Big money managers that serve as the largest stockholders in big, publicly traded companies are shying away from any proposals likely to be viewed as activism, according to Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar’s director of investment stewardship research.That includes proposals both for and against ESG- and DEI-type policies.""Certainly, asset managers have dialed down their enthusiasm to back these kinds of proposals over the last few years,"" Stewart said.The apparent swing in favor of less disclosure may be an indication that shareholders are growing tired of trying to influence corporate behavior.""It’s still too early to tell,"" said Stewart, referring to whether this year will show a statistically significant shift.There have been some other notable company victories so far in 2024.At Tyson Foods, shareholders voted against a third-party audit to monitor its worker population while the meat producer faces claims its employment of minors violated US labor laws.At Applied Materials, shareholders of the semiconductor materials manufacturer voted against proposals to report on quantitative median and adjusted pay gaps across race and gender.One greenhouse gas emissions proposal has won shareholder approval so far this year, according to ISS-Corporate. That came at Jack In the Box (JACK), where 56% of shareholders voted to require disclosure of emission reduction targets.There could be another explanation for the waning support: New reporting mandates from regulators and US exchanges are starting to satisfy investors.A lot of new rules have been passed this decade requiring more information from companies. In 2020, the SEC expanded human capital disclosure rules to require that companies disclose risks and resources associated with their employee headcount.The next year in 2021, the SEC made it easier for investors to get climate change and social issues on corporate voting ballots, while Nasdaq made it mandatory for listed companies to disclose diversity.Starting in 2025, the SEC's new climate rules will require companies to reveal their carbon footprint in an effort to help investors evaluate how climate change may impact businesses’ bottom line.""Those regulations and standards are starting to hit,"" Stewart said, ""so I think [shareholders] are feeling less need to push quite so hard on them because there are actual requirements out there that are prompting companies to make those kinds of disclosures.""No matter the reason, overall support for ESG-focused resolutions is falling and will likely continue, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.""I think we're entering a phase moving away from the investor activism side of things into a phase where there's written down regulations and standards,"" Stewart said.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-19 08:45:00+00:00,3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March,"Picking stocks doesn't have to be hard. One way to make it easy is to poach a few ideas from proven, veteran investors. And no veteran is more proven than the legendary Warren Buffett. He has led Berkshire Hathaway to decades of market-beating performance with a buy-and-hold approach. The average investor would do well to follow his lead.Here are three stocks Berkshire Hathaway holds that would likely be at home in your portfolio as well.It's a tough time to be excited about bank stocks. The echoes of last year's collapse of SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank are still ringing after a similar (but less severe) meltdown from New York Community Bancorp just last month. In the meantime, demand for new loans is waning due to high interest rates while delinquencies and defaults on existing loans grow. It just doesn't feel like a great time to be invested in the sector.But the headlines are painting a picture that is grimmer than reality for most banks. Broadly speaking, major banks are doing fine. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is no exception.It's noticing a headwind, to be sure. Total deposits fell a bit during the final quarter of last year, and loan losses inched a tad higher. Its corporate banking and capital markets business also slipped slightly year over year during the fourth quarter of 2023.None of these lulls are extraordinary, though. And they're muted by BofA's improving tangible common equity ratio as well as the healthy containment of loan losses. Its per-share book value also continues to rise. These are all signs that it is successfully navigating the storm that's rocking other banks' boats.BofA shares aren't exactly reflecting this resilience right now. The stock is still priced well below its early 2022 peak and is still closer to October's low. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. It has pushed the dividend yield up to a healthy 2.7%.Berkshire Hathaway currently holds a little more than 1 billion shares of Bank of America. This $37 billion stake accounts for 10% of the conglomerate's portfolio and is its second-biggest holding.What is Berkshire's single-biggest position? That's still Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 900 million shares, worth $157 billion -- more than 40% of the total value of its equity portfolio.Buffett wouldn't touch Apple for many years. He has long eschewed technology stocks largely because their businesses are difficult to understand.Technology has taken center stage, though, making the sector's stocks unavoidable by serving up most of the market's very best opportunities. It doesn't hurt that Buffett is no longer picking Berkshire's holdings all by himself; younger managers with a better handle on tech stocks' nuances might bear most of the responsibility for the fund's stake in Apple.However Apple ended up in Buffett's portfolio, it's been an enormous winner. Since Berkshire first established a then-small position in Apple shares in early 2016, the stock has advanced from less than $30 per share (stock-split adjusted) to nearly $200. That's a big reason it has become such a huge part of Berkshire's portfolio; it's grown into an oversized trade.Although it's one of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, it hasn't produced magnificent returns of late. Shares are currently priced where they were at the end of 2021, mostly because of slowing iPhone sales.That could be why Berkshire even shed a small sliver of its Apple position during the fourth quarter of last year. Still, Buffett arguably realizes that even a weakened Apple is a better investment than most other companies are when they're at their best.He has also said Berkshire has a record-breaking $167.6 billion worth of cash it can't find anything compelling to do with. That's why it's still holding 99% of the Apple position it was holding prior to the fourth quarter. Take the hint.Lastly, add energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your list of Buffett stocks to buy in March.Oil and natural gas stocks can be tricky because they are largely tethered to unpredictable commodity prices. Also, some companies in the sector are run more efficiently than others, and some simply hold better discovery and drilling prospects than others.Chevron is one of the world's leading energy names in both regards, mostly because of its sheer size. The company has the financial wherewithal to buy and develop the projects it needs when it needs them. For example, it recently completed its acquisition of PDC Energy, adding more than 1 billion barrels of proven oil reserves to its portfolio.This ability to purchase or develop oil and gas wells isn't the only reason to own Chevron; it's also a refiner, offering another profit center. Although the aim of a carbon-free future supported by environmentally friendlier renewable energy is worth pursuing, oil and gas alone still account for roughly half of the world's energy consumption.It will be decades before alternative energy sources like solar and wind can take over. The International Energy Agency says worldwide demand for crude oil will continue to grow before peaking at 105.7 million barrels per day in 2028. And even then, we'll still need massive amounts of it for several more decades. Standard & Poor's predicts that in 2050, oil will still be the world's single-biggest source of energy, with renewables a close second.Chevron stock hasn't really gone anywhere since early 2022, but it still has plenty of long-term upside. In the meantime, Berkshire's 126 million shares of the energy company are paying 4.2% of their current value in dividends.Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 08:06:00+00:00,These 3 Companies Have Collectively Repurchased $1.07 Trillion of Their Own Stock Since the Start of 2013,"In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following a challenging year in 2022, which saw all three major stock indexes plunge into respective bear markets, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite have all launched to new all-time highs in 2024.There isn't just one factor that can be pointed to as the fuel for Wall Street's epic rally. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that includes a strong U.S. economy, better-than-expected corporate earnings, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a next-big-thing trend, and a historically robust level of share repurchase activity.Although aggregate corporate share buybacks in 2023 fell from the record levels observed during the 2022 bear market, the $787.3 billion S&P 500 companies collectively spent on share repurchases on a trailing-12-month basis, as of Sept. 30, 2023, remains well above the historic average.The reason public companies enact share repurchase programs is threefold:For companies with steady or growing net income, a steady reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it can make a company appear more fundamentally attractive to investors.When a public company retires shares of its common stock, the ownership stakes of existing/long-term shareholders can increase over time. This encourages investors to have a long-term mindset.It's a way for a company's board of directors to demonstrate faith in a company's long-term growth strategy.While more than 56% of S&P 500 companies repurchased at least $5 million worth of their own stock during the September-ended quarter, there are a few companies that are step above the rest when it comes to buybacks.Since 2013, the following three widely owned companies have collectively repurchased $1.07 trillion worth of their own stock.When it comes to share repurchases, it's fair to say that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is in a class of its own. Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, the company has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock.To put this into context, there are only eight companies in the S&P 500, excluding Apple, with a market cap above $651 billion. Apple could have comfortably purchased 491 of the other 499 S&P 500 companies with the amount of money it's spent buying back its stock.There are a couple of reasons Apple has an abundance of cash to repurchase its stock. To start with, it's a trusted brand with an exceptionally loyal following. A survey conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 of more than 2,000 iPhone users found that nearly 92% had no intention of switching smartphone brands with their next purchase.Innovation is the other big reason Apple has been nothing short of a cash cow. Domestically, Apple's iPhone has accounted for 50% or more of smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable in 2020.However, Apple's future rests with innovation beyond the physical realm. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift toward subscription services. A subscription-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin, help smooth out some of the revenue lumpiness associated with physical product upgrade cycles, and can further enhance the benefits of the Apple product and service ecosystem.While reducing its outstanding share count by 41% since 2013 has provided a lift to Apple's EPS, investors should remain diligent about digging beneath the surface when analyzing the company's growth trends. For instance, even though Apple's adjusted EPS ticked higher by $0.02 per share in fiscal 2023 (ended in September), the company's net income fell by $2.8 billion to $97 billion for the year.For the moment, Apple's buybacks are helping to partially mask a stalling of its growth engine.Another S&P 500 component that's turned on the proverbial jets in the buyback department in recent years is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, social media site YouTube, and autonomous driving company Waymo, among other ventures.Since initiating a share repurchase program in 2015, Alphabet's stock buybacks have grown with each passing year. The $61.5 billion spent repurchasing its stock in 2023 increased its aggregate buybacks over roughly eight years to $240 billion. Alphabet has spent enough on buybacks that it could have purchased all but 28 companies within the S&P 500, not counting itself.If you're wondering what's made Alphabet such a success for so long, look no further than its virtual monopoly, Google. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back almost nine years. It's the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target their message(s) to users. As a result, Google tends to enjoy premium ad-pricing power in most economic climates.However, the lion's share of Alphabet's cash flow growth moving forward may well come from Google Cloud. As of the September-ended quarter, Google Cloud was the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, with an estimated 10% share of enterprise cloud spending. More importantly, this segment generated a full-year profit in 2023 after many years of losses. Cloud services tend to produce considerably higher margins than advertising.As Alphabet's outstanding share count continues to shrink, the company's sales and net income are climbing. This is a recipe for EPS growth to outpace sales growth for the foreseeable future.The third juggernaut that's been putting the pedal to the medal in the buyback department for more than a decade is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Though I've arbitrarily cut off the start date at 2013, Microsoft has been repurchasing its stock for even longer than Apple. Since 2013, it's collectively retired around $183 billion worth of its common stock.Not including itself, Microsoft has spent more on buybacks since the beginning of 2013 than the market caps of all but 41 S&P 500 companies.Microsoft's continued outperformance is a function of it seamlessly blending its legacy operations with a handful of high-growth initiatives. For example, it's no secret that the growth heyday for Windows and Office have long since passed. Nevertheless, Windows still holds a 72% share of desktop operating systems worldwide. This is an exceptionally high-margin segment that generates abundant cash flow, which allows Microsoft to aggressively invest in higher-growth initiatives.With regard to ""high-growth initiatives,"" I'm primarily talking about cloud services and AI. Cloud infrastructure service platform Azure is the world's No. 2 provider in terms of enterprise spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and recently unveiled its Maia AI chip to help power its own Azure data centers. The cloud and AI can help Microsoft sustain a double-digit sales growth rate.Microsoft also has what might be the most pristine balance sheet on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to receive the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Microsoft closed out calendar year 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's generated nearly $103 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash allows Microsoft to innovate, make acquisitions, buy back copious amounts of its own stock, and comfortably pay out the largest nominal-dollar dividend among publicly traded companies in the U.S.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 07:32:07+00:00,11 Best Dividend ETFs To Buy,"In this article, we discuss 11 best dividend ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on dividend-paying companies, head over to 5 Best Dividend ETFs To Buy. Reuters reported that global corporate dividends reached a record high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, largely due to substantial contributions from banks. According to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, nearly 86% of listed companies worldwide either increased or maintained their dividends. Projections from the same index indicate that dividend payouts are set to hit a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the leading dividend payer in 2023, followed closely by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The overall value of corporate dividends saw a 5% increase from 2022 to 2023, totaling $1.57 trillion. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, attributed this growth to robust corporate cash flow, driving dividends and share buybacks. Moreover, high interest rates boosted bank margins, resulting in a record $220 billion payout to shareholders in 2023. However, this positive trend was counteracted by significant dividend cuts in the mining sector, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Although the rapid ascent of bank dividends may decelerate, declines in the mining sector are expected to have a reduced impact. Despite challenges in specific sectors, diverse industries such as vehicles, utilities, software, food, and engineering demonstrated promising growth. Geographically, Europe (excluding the UK) and Japan played pivotal roles in global dividend growth, with Europe witnessing a 10.4% increase in payouts. The United States, while making a substantial contribution to global dividend growth owing to its size, reported a growth rate in line with the global average at 5.1%. Conversely, emerging markets observed stagnant dividends, with Brazil facing substantial cuts and China experiencing lackluster growth.The Federal Reserve responded to the rise in inflation, spurred by monetary easing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by steadily increasing interest rates throughout 2023. This move had significant ramifications, leading to heightened borrowing costs for companies amid escalating interest rates and inflationary pressures. S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that there was a notable 59% increase in the number of companies filing for bankruptcy in 2023, compared to the previous year, nearing levels observed during the pandemic's peak. However, the anticipated growth in regular dividends in the US market averages around 5.8%, aligning with the 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% since 2014. The energy sector leads variable dividends, driven by a shift towards performance-based shareholder return policies since 2019. In 2022, over 20 energy companies disbursed a record $20 billion in variable dividends, benefiting from elevated oil and gas prices. However, in 2023, companies favored share repurchases due to lower valuation. The size of variable dividends in 2024 will hinge on oil and gas price volatility, demand, and its impact on share prices. The five largest sectors collectively contribute nearly 40% of total dividends and 2.05% in the estimated 5.8% growth, with real estate mandated to distribute the majority of its earnings.Lately, investors are showing renewed interest in dividend-paying stocks this year after a period of decline in 2023, despite robust returns in the US stock market. Last year, rising interest rates led investors to favor bonds over stocks with smaller payouts, while mega-cap tech stocks attracted attention due to artificial intelligence hype. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index saw a modest 5.7% increase compared to the broader S&P 500 total return index's 26% gain. However, with recent declines in yields and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, dividend stocks are gaining traction again. Analysts suggest that investors are seeking stable, higher-yielding dividends amidst ongoing market volatility, particularly during an easing cycle. Companies that raise their dividends often receive favorable attention from investors, as evidenced by recent examples such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), whose stock prices increased following dividend hikes and share buyback announcements. Historical data indicates that companies increasing dividends tend to outperform in the stock market, while those lowering dividends may face underperformance.Some of the best dividend stocks to buy include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). However, this article includes the best dividend ETFs to buy, which also expose investors to top stocks in the industry. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

It offers investors exposure to a wide array of dividend-paying firms in this segment, catering to both growth potential and income objectives.

(NYSE:VST) is the largest holding of WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (NYSE:DON). It is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company operating in the United States and the District of Columbia. On February 23, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) declared a $0.215 per share quarterly dividend, a 0.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.213. The dividend is payable on March 29, to shareholders on record as of March 20. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), compared to 52 funds in the last quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.60 million shares worth $177.2 million. Sound Shore Management made the following regarding Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“For the year, we had a number of stocks up 50% or more and the list includes a diverse set of industries such as homebuilding, heavy truck manufacturing, and semiconductor capital equipment. We would like to highlight one outstanding contributor for the year, electricity generator and marketer Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), a low-cost provider with a healthy balance between generation and retail. Demand for electricity is growing and notably, load peaks are changing as well. As the country brings on more renewables and adjusts to greater demand later in the day due to increased use of electric heat pumps and electric car charging, reliable clean power is at a premium. Vistra is well positioned with diversified fuel sources including solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and battery power storage facilities, along with a marketing division to manage price volatility. The company will soon be closing its accretive acquisition of merchant power generator, Energy Harbor, and the deal will make Vistra the second largest carbon free, nuclear electricity provider behind Constellation Energy, another portfolio holding. Vistra CEO Jim Burke, leads a veteran utility management team that is committed to transitioning the company’s portfolio to a sustainable footprint by closing older fossil fuel plants and increasing the renewables portfolio. They have also been an important voice to advocate for changes that will accelerate the global transition to a clean, renewable energy future, while maintaining adequate near-term supply. Vistra has a strong balance sheet that allows the company to invest in innovation and operational improvements. Additionally, management is using excess cash flow to buy 40% of the outstanding shares over a five year period and they are more than half way through that process. Currently valued at 9 times earnings with a 17% free cash flow yield and a 2.3% dividend, the stock remains a full position. As you can see from the chart below, Vistra’s performance was quite different than many other electricity providers and provides further evidence of the disparate performance that can often be found within a sector.”5-year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 36.14%Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VYM) aims to replicate the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which measures the returns of stocks with high dividend yields.

2024-03-19 01:37:38+00:00,Apple is getting serious about AI,"​​ Apple appears to be finally raising the curtain on some of its AI efforts.Apple researchers say they’ve developed a family of multimodal models — which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time — called MM1. The report said its new methods boasts “superior abilities” and can offer advanced reasoning and in-context learning to respond to text and images.The announcement hints at how such a system could benefit future Apple products, including iPhones, Macs and its Siri voice assistant.It comes as Apple is expected to unveil several new AI features at its developer conference in June.At the same time, however, Apple has reportedly reached a deal with Google that indicates perhaps its own AI efforts are not quite where they want them to be yet. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is interested in licensing and building Google’s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features.As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies already making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race.The report also said Apple previously held conversations with OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT.Apple, Google and OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.In February, CEO Tim Cook teased during an investors meeting that he sees “incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we’re currently investing significantly in this area.” But the company has not yet shared much about its vision for AI.Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a Machine Learning Research division dedicated to advancing AI.Angelo Zino, a VP and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in an investors note on Monday that the latest news “likely confirms that Apple’s internal efforts are well behind those of OpenAI and Gemini.”But he added a potential deal “shows that the company is serious about adding significant AI capabilities across iOS 18 this fall when its new iPhones launch.”Google may be well suited for the new AI partnership considering its existing search partnership; the company has invested heavily on ensuring Google remains the default search engine option on Apple’s Safari browser. That search arrangement between the two tech giants, however, is under review by antitrust authorities.In another investor’s note on Monday, Wedbush Securities analysts said they see the potential partnership as a boon for both companies.“This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major license fee attached to this,” the analysts said.It would also give Apple the foundation and technology to double down on AI-powered iOS features currently being developed.The partnership could bring Gemini to nearly 2 billion Apple devices.Wedbush also said the deal would be a huge “validation moment” for Google’s generative AI positioning, considering Microsoft and OpenAI captured early market share by commercializing some of their products.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-getting-serious-ai-180823049.html
2024-03-18 21:45:48+00:00,Nvidia bringing its Omniverse technology to Apple's Vision Pro headset,"Nvidia (NVDA) says that it is bringing its Omniverse enterprise technology to Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.The idea is to let developers use Nvidia’s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia’s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they’ll behave or look in the real world.Nvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.During GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.The company says it’s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.“Apple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,” Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. “We look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.”The move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia’s Omniverse is available on Apple’s high-end headset and gives Apple’s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.Whether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

2024-03-18 20:48:49+00:00,"Alphabet's AI play, tech sector lags: Market takeaways","As the trading day draws to a close, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins the Live Show to discuss the top three market takeaways for Monday.With the highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision looming on Wednesday, markets are navigating a state of uncertainty. While the broader market is not significantly underperforming— small-cap stocks, the homebuilder sector, and regional banks are all lagging behind, despite yields continuing their upward trajectory.Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are gaining momentum after the company announced the potential integration of its Gemini AI into Apple's (AAPL) iPhones. This news has fueled investor enthusiasm, propelling Alphabet's stock nearly 5% higher.The communication services sector continues to lead market gains, outpacing the broader S&P 500 index (^GSPC). In contrast, the tech sector is underperforming relative to the benchmark.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJOSH LIPTON: Stocks looking to rebound after two straight weeks of declines as investors eye this week's Fed decision. Josh Schafer is here with us with his takeaways of the day, Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Josh, I mean, I was perusing the different headlines from Austin various financial news networks today this morning. And I would have thought stocks would fall. It felt like we were-- the conversation this morning was about we're going to learn that the Fed is going to cut maybe less than we hoped.And we might see overall less cuts, maybe later cuts. It seems like we're starting to already get worried about what is going to happen at this Wednesday meeting. And then I take a look at the market action today. And that is not what happened.We rallied about almost 1% in the S&P 500. And we had a 1% rally in the NASDAQ. But what I want to highlight here guys is sort of the divergence that we did see between what did underperform. So when we take a look at what underperformed today, you could look at small caps underperformed.We have homebuilders underperforming. We have regional banks underperforming. And the reason I highlight this is sort of the chart that we have up here now.This is a chart from Mike Wilson over at Morgan Stanley. And he was pointing out the different moves we've seen in small caps versus large caps in relation to interest rate movements. We've seen large caps be a lot more resilient to the moves.We've seen in rates over the last month compared to small caps. I'm highlighting this because I'm curious what we see on Wednesday. If we can continue to see yields go higher and the overall anticipation and the pricing in of less cuts, is it another day where small caps could significantly sink compared to the S&P 500?I like to use small caps because to me, that's sort of become part of the proxy of this soft landing trade of this. We're going to get a lot of cuts trade, small caps ripped on that. And now, we're seeing them still react more. But that resilience we're seeing in large caps that we did see again today could be what maybe holds us up depending on what comes on Wednesday.MADISON MILLS: Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: Go ahead, Madi.MADISON MILLS: Well, I just think it's interesting. I remember on Friday, we were talking about how typically historically it had been the day in March where the market hits its lowest lows for the last 20 years. So there was a little bit of seasonality coming into play that made me think we might be in the green this morning.But then it's always fascinating when you look at bifurcation that we're seeing in treasuries. And you see the two-year yield climbing to its highest highs for the year. What is going on with that? These are supposed to move in different directions. I just don't--JOSH SCHAFER: At what point do investors care about the 10-year yield moving higher. We've had the 10-year kind of chugging higher for basically it feels like a month or two now, at least relatively consistently on a trend basis.MADISON MILLS: When does it bite.JOSH SCHAFER: And when does that actually matter to equities again? Wilson highlighted in his note 4.35%. I think we're right there right now.Maybe it was 4.3 4%. But sort of saying we're getting to that level now where we're going to start talking about bond yields being higher. And even if you're just a stock investor, that just owns something like the index, it might be time to start paying attention to it again.MADISON MILLS: Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: Especially as yields move higher, too, Josh. Interesting to see the repercussions. Like you would think tech wouldn't work against that. Those interest rates names.JOSH SCHAFER: But take away, too, for today, Josh. What if you have an AI play? Then it always works even if yields are going up.I wanted to highlight the announcement from Alphabet today because I found it particularly or I shouldn't say announcement. Sorry. The report that Alphabet may be included Gemini AI may be included on iPhones. We saw big move in shares of Google on this, nearly 5% move in the stock from that.And it just stuck out to me because I couldn't name a tech company that needed more of an AI win. They needed to have an AI. And a rumor I guess, we'll call it news come out. And then see the stock go up for once, rather than having some of these AI announcements and rumors that have come out about them.And it really hasn't done well on some of those trades. So to me, it stuck out just to see shares go up in that reaction. And then also for Apple shares to not necessarily fall on this news.There's a read of this report where you could say so Apple's not building their own AI. That's not good. Where's Apple's involvement here?MADISON MILLS: Still not in the AI race.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe it's actually just a smart play from Apple.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, that's what we were talking off camera, Josh, about how Evercore kind of saw it AI features without AI CapEx as they put it. Yeah.MADISON MILLS: You were looking at comm services as well, Josh. What's your takeaways?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes our final takeaway is just I love to look at the sectors and just click on the year-to-date sometimes on the Wi-Fi interactive. It's pretty fun. It's pretty fun activity for me during the day.And when we take a look at that, when you look at communication services here, up 11% on the year. It was up 2% today. But what stands out to me here too, Madi, that really I found interesting. Look at what is underperforming, the S&P 500.Minimally, I should add, but tech. And it just sort of reminds us of when we talk about tech broadly, what's actually in the tech sector versus what's actually in the communication services sector? And so you see technically underperforming the S&P 500 here for the year.But communication services outperforming. And that's because today we saw a jump in communication services from that jump we were just talking about and Alphabet. Meta's had a great year. Netflix has had a great year.And so it's just interesting to me. I feel like we talk a lot about tech is still leading the market. Tech is still leading the market.Just to note. We're not always talking about XLK. We might be talking about the NASDAQ. But we're not always talking about XLK.It's some other sectors, too, that are participating here. And that one stuck out to me because it was up 2%.MADISON MILLS: It's a great point for any retail investors who are looking to tech specific ETFs. Just remember to look under the hood a little bit when you're on the Robinhood app. Josh, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/fed-decision-alphabets-ai-play-204849156.html

But she predicted it will see a gradual recovery later this year after expected reductions in inflation, energy costs and interest rates.The group, which owns Cocktail Club and Dirty Martini venues, revealed sales of £33.4m for the six months to December 31, compared with £23.5m over the same period a year earlier.Sales were boosted by the group’s continued expansion through acquisitions.Nightcap also confirmed that it dropped to a £1.8m pre-tax loss for the past half-year, from a £0.9m loss a year earlier.Mike Lynch, former chief executive of  Autonomy, pictured, has arrived at a Federal court in San Francisco today.Mr Lynch has been charged with 16 counts of fraud related to the sale of Autonomy, the former FTSE 100 software company, to Hewlett Packard in 2011.

Apple shares are up 1.5pc.But according to Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, this risks concentrating power in Google’s hands. He said:For Google, any hypothetical deal with Apple could mean they essentially “own” generative AI on mobile devices (Android and iOS).It also means Apple may not be in a position to catch-up to GenAI leaders, at least not in the next generation of devices.China’s property crisis deepened last month as housing sales plunged and builders cut back on new developments. Deputy economics editor Tim Wallace reports:Challenges across the country’s real estate sector were laid bare in new figures for February that revealed properties sold fell by more than a fifth year-on-year.This led to a 9pc drop-off in overall investment across the real estate sector, which continues to struggle under the weight of an underwhelming recovery from Covid.The amount of floorspace under construction in China was also down 29.7pc year-on-year.Lynn Song, economist at ING, said confidence in the industry remains weak, as he warned that the property market will keep shrinking through 2024.“The sentiment index has yet to bottom out as well, falling further from 93.34 at the end of 2023 to 92.13 in February, a new all-time low,” he said.“With little sign of a turnaround in sentiment so far, we expect property to remain a major drag on growth this year.”The data came as Hui Ka Yan, the founder and former chairman of property giant Evergrande, was given a lifetime ban from participating in China’s stock markets.Read the full story...Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is picking up due to a recent fall in prices, Shell chief Wael Sawan said today at a conference in Houston.LNG shipping has seen little impact from attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, he said.The LNG market will be well supplied in the second half of the decade, he added.

This will take Pfizer’s stake in Haleon down to 24pc from 32pc, which follows sell-offs by Pfizer’s joint venture partner GSK.Hannah Boland has more on how the founders have been selling out:On its debut, around 45pc of shares in the company were held by GSK and Pfizer, which had created the company in 2019 as a joint venture of their consumer health businesses.The planned share sale marks the first step in Pfizer’s push to exit its position. It previously said it would do so “in a disciplined manner” to maximise value for its own shareholders.Haleon owns brands including Centrum vitamins, Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol pain relief. It recently sold off its Lamisil antifungal cream and Chapstick brands as it focuses on reducing its debt pile. By the end of 2023, it had reduced its debt by more than £2bn since its spin-off from GSK.GSK has already started selling down its position in Haleon. Last May, it sold 240m shares, taking its stake from 13pc down to 10.3pc .

Soho’s stock has lost more than 50pc of its value since the company floated its shares in 2021.Soho House has been approached for comment. CC Capital declined to comment.Global stocks have jumped today, while Treasury yields crept higher, as investors looked ahead to a raft of central bank meetings this week that could see the end of free money in Japan and a blueprint for US rate cuts this year.Upbeat industrial output and retail sales data from China have also helped.In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 0.41pc, the S&P 500 gained 0.92pc, and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.28pc.Tuesday could see Japan end the longest run of negative interest rates in history, after its companies decided on the biggest pay hikes in 33 years.However, there is a chance the Bank of Japan might wait for its April meeting, given it will be issuing updated economic forecasts then.Japan’s Nikkei closed up 2.7pc, while Shanghai’s blue chip index finished up about 1pc.I’m heading off now and Alex Singleton will be typing like the wind as he keeps you up to speed with the latest.Speaking of which, Sir James Dyson has unveiled his company’s new Supersonic Nural hair dryer which will be unveiled soon.It will not come cheap, mind you, retailing at £399.99 soon.More than half of the money allocated to government heat pump grants so far has gone unspent as installers battle red tape and lower-than-expected demand from households.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the latest:Through the boiler upgrade scheme, consumers can claim a voucher worth £7,500 towards the cost of getting a heat pump fitted in their home.But despite the scheme getting a budget of £300m for its first two financial years, 58pc of the cash remains unspent after demand fell short of expectations.From the boiler upgrade scheme’s launch in May 2022 to the end of February this year, just £127m of vouchers have been redeemed, according to official figures published on Friday.That was after 35,700 voucher applications were received but only 22,300 redeemed.With just one month left before the end of the scheme’s second financial year, the numbers fall far short of the 60,000 vouchers the scheme was designed to have funded by this point.It also comes after the Government increased the amount of money available in October, from £5,000 per household to £7,500.The boss of the world’s largest oil company has said the switch to renewable sources of energy is “visibly failing” and the governments should “abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas”.Saudi Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told the fossil fuels conference CERAWeek that a peak in worldwide oil demand is unlikely for “for some time to come, let alone 2030,” as forecast by the International Energy Agency.He said crude demand would reach an all-time high during the second half of this year, with significant growth potential in developing countries.He added that without government subsidies, electric vehicles are as much as 50pc more expensive than internal-combustion cars,He said: “They cannot be subsidised forever.”He told the conference in Houston:We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions.We should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive.One of the most “hawkish” policymakers at the Bank of England who has consistently voted for interest rate increases has been reappointed to her position.Catherine Mann will serve a second three-year term on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which sets interest rates, the Treasury announced.Her first term was due to end later this summer, and she will now remain in place on the nine-member MPC until the end of August 2027.Ms Mann, a former chief economist at the OECD and Citibank, was one of two interest rate setters who still voted to increase borrowing costs further in February, even as another colleague voted for cuts in a three-way split.The Bank of England held interest rates steady at 5.25pc and makes its next decision on Thursday.Rishi Sunak has set out plans to support female entrepreneurs, cut red tape for businesses, and boost apprenticeships.The Prime Minister said he wants the UK to be the “best place in the world” for women to start a business.He also pledged to create up to 20,000 more apprenticeships with plans to fully fund training for young people.Speaking at a business event in Coventry, Mr Sunak said:Female founders receive just 2pc of equity investment and that figure hasn’t budged in a decade.So, to change that, we’re announcing a new Invest In Women taskforce led by Hannah Bernard from Barclays and serial entrepreneur Debbie Wosskow. It’s going to raise a female-focused investment fund to address that gap directly.We’re going to make the UK the best place in the world to be a female founder.So, lower taxes, less admin, better access to finance - that’s how we’re backing our small businesses.Asked whether he ever abuses his ketamine prescription, Elon Musk said: “I don’t think so.”He told Don Lemon:If you use too much ketamine you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work.I typically put in 16-hour days. That’s normal for me. It’s rare for me to even take off a weekend day.So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.I can’t really get wasted because I can’t get my work done.He said he takes a “small amount” once every other week.The main US stock indexes opened higher amid a rally in megacap growth stocks and chipmakers ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meeting this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 112.16 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 38,826.93.The S&P 500 opened higher by 37.68 points, or 0.7pc, at 5,154.77, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 181.75 points, or 1.1pc, to 16,154.92 at the opening bell.Elon Musk did not rule out endorsing Donald Trump to be the next US president after admitting that the Republican nominee met him for breakfast at a friend’s house.Mr Musk said Mr Trump “did most of the talking” but he did not recall him saying “anything he hasn’t said publicly”.He stold former CNN anchor Don Lemon in an interview on YouTube that he would not make a donation to any candidate in the US presidential elections and the Republican nominee did not ask him for one.He said he is not paying Mr Trump’s legal bills “in any way, shape or form”.He said:I may in the final stretch endorse a candidate but I don’t know yet.I want to make a considered decision before the election and if I do decide to endorse a candidate then I will explain exactly why.Tesla chief exectuve Elon Musk has defended his use of ketamine, saying it is in the best interests of the shareholders in the electric vehicle maker and the other companies that he runs.The billionaire entrepreneur, who also leads SpaceX, said that for investors on Wall Street “what matters is execution”.Mr Musk said he takes the drug on prescription to treat what he described as “chemical tides” that lead to depression-like symptoms.He told former CNN anchor Don Lemon in an interview on YouTube: “There are times when I have a negative chemical state in my brain, like depression I guess, or depression that’s not linked to any negative news, and ketamine is helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.”He added: “From an investor standpoint, if there is something I’m taking, we should keep taking it.”An article in the Wall Street Journal in January said that executives at Tesla and SpaceX had grown concerned about his recreational drug use.The Don Lemon Show episode 1: Elon MuskTIMESTAMPS:(02:23) News on X(10:07) Donald Trump and Endorsing a Candidate(13:04) The New Tesla Roadster(16:46) Relaxation and Video Games(17:54) Tweeting

search engine’s chatbot technology installed on every iPhone, despite a row over the system’s excessive efforts to promote diversity.Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:The two tech giants are in discussions over licensing parts of Google’s Gemini bot for the iPhone’s built-in AI tools such as its Siri assistant, Bloomberg reported.A deal would be a major boost to Google, whose chatbot has been under fire for returning allegedly biased answers to questions and for publishing “diverse” images of historical figures by depicting white figures such as Nazi soldiers and Vikings as black.Apple has been developing its own AI features for the next version of the iPhone’s operating system, including a version of Siri powered by “generative AI” technology similar to chatbots such as Gemini and ChatGPT.Read why a partnership with Google could raise concerns.EasyJet has said its first new UK base in more than a decade will give passengers more travel options and could reduce fares.The airline’s new operation at Birmingham Airport will also create 140 direct jobs for pilots and crew, and support a further 1,200 indirect jobs, according to the carrier.It is easyJet’s first new UK base since it launched at Southend Airport in 2012.EasyJet has previously operated flights to and from Birmingham Airport using planes based elsewhere.Basing three planes at the West Midlands airport will allow the airline to launch 16 new routes this summer to destinations such as Antalya in Turkey, the Greek island of Kos, and Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt.It will also increase frequencies on its existing network, equating to more than 50pc additional flights each week.Speaking at a press conference at the airport, easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: “This is going to provide a huge amount of additional connectivity, which not only will serve the holidays community, but also a very critical part of the business community as well.”US stock indexes gained in premarket trading ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meeting this week, where policymakers are expected to keep borrowing costs steady.Stronger-than-expected inflation figures last week have prompted investors to rethink when and by how much the Fed will lower rates this year.Traders have been pulling back bets of a June rate cut to around 59pc from 71pc last Monday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Nevertheless, Wall Street, led by optimism around artificial intelligence (AI), hit fresh all-time highs in March, before pulling back some gains last week.Meanwhile, exchange operator Nasdaq said it has resolved an issue related to connectivity and stock orders after more than two hours.Ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had gained 0.8pc and the Nasdaq 100 was up 1.2pc.Cocoa prices have doubled since the start of the year as shoppers prepare for large price increases for chocolate eggs this Easter.Contracts for the crop in New York have risen to $8,394 a metric ton, the highest on record as yields in West Africa have been battered by disease and extreme weather.Last month Cadbury, the market leader for Easter eggs which has been producing them since 1875, has warned that it may have to raise prices or shrink its products “as a last resort”. Nestle has warned the same.While manufacturers buy cocoa beans months ahead of time, the surge in prices is beginning to bite.Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said he expects manufacturers will increasingly resort to making their products smaller to cut costs, sparking another wave of so-called “shrinkflation”.Martin Hug, chief financial officer at chocolate maker Lindt, said this month:There are lots of players who have already announced price increases. We are also part of that group.It is very difficult to predict at the moment what will happen with the cocoa market. But I think we have controlled it as well as we can.The level of bets on strong gains for the pound has reached its highest point in 17 years as the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at 16-year highs until the late summer.Hedge funds are backing sterling to move higher and cutting back positions on falls in the currency amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will reduce interest rates more quickly than in Britain.It has taken overall bets in favour of the pound to the most since July 2007, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the week to March 12.The pound has been the best performer among the so-called G10 group of the world’s major currencies since the start of the year.Money markets are pricing in a first interest rate cut by the Bank of England in August and only one more quarter of a point cut by the end of the year.Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is priced in to make a first cut in July, with a 50.4pc chance of a June cut.However, Goldman Sachs said the Bank of England could cut rates earlier if inflation falls faster than expected when figures are published on Wednesday.Roberto Cobo Garcia, head of G-10 FX strategy at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, added:Current positioning suggests the pound upside potential is limited and that any negative news could trigger a correction.If inflation or employment data weakens in spring, the pound would trade in lower levels into the summer.Three Tory MPs have been found to have broken Ofcom’s broadcasting rules on due impartiality during programmes on GB News.The watchdog’s investigation involved five episodes of shows presented separately by former House of Commons leader Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and minister without portfolio Esther McVey, and backbencher Philip Davies.A further episode of Sir Jacob’s State Of The Nation was not investigated because it did not raise issues under the rules, according to Ofcom.Married couple Ms McVey and Mr Davies are no longer part of the GB News line-up, and last hosted programmes on the channel last year.Ofcom said: “We found that two episodes of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s State Of The Nation, two episodes of Friday Morning With Esther And Phil, and one episode of Saturday Morning With Esther And Phil, broadcast during May and June 2023, failed to comply with Rules 5.1 and 5.3 of the Broadcasting Code.”The media watchdog said that because the politicians “acted as newsreaders, news interviewers or news reporters in sequences which clearly constituted news - including reporting breaking news events - without exceptional justification, news was, therefore, not presented with due impartiality”.Oil prices have hit a fresh four-month high amid optimism about China’s industrial output.Global benchmark Brent rose 0.6pc towards $86 a barrel after gaining 4pc last week, while West Texas Intermediate was up 0.8pc and heading in the direction of $82.It comes after China’s factory output and investment grew more strongly than expected at the start of the year., In refining, output hit a record.Meanwhile, Russian oil refineries were hit by drone strikes over weekend, just as Vladimir Putin strolled to victory in a presidential election which Defence Secretary Grant Shapps accused Putin of stealing.European natural gas prices have risen for a fourth day amid concerns about global energy supplies.The benchmark contract on the continent jumped as much as 7.7pc in its biggest intraday jump since January 3.Prices have rallied for the longest period since the end of January after plunging as much as 30pc since the start of the year.Outages at global gas liquefaction facilities — from Malaysia to the US — are sending jitters through the market.Colder-than-normal temperatures are also expected across parts of northern Europe next week before heading higher.Dutch front-month futures, Europe’s gas benchmark, were last up 5.1pc to more than €28 per megawatt-hour. The UK equivalent contract was up 5.3pc to more than 71p per therm.The world’s largest solar power manufacturer is poised to announce plans to cut nearly a third of its workforce as costs rise for the net zero industry.Longi plans to reduce staff levels by as much as 30pc as it ramps up a reduction in its headcount which began in November, according to Bloomberg News.The Chinese company employed about 80,000 people at its peak last year but has suffered amid a wider downturn in the country’s solar industry.Manufacturers have been forced to sell at or below production costs after prices for solar panels fell to record lows last year.Longi, which makes wafers used in solar panels, also had to significantly cut prices last year amdi fierce competition in the sector.The pound has regained its footing against the dollar after falling 1pc last week.Sterling was last flat at $1.27 as traders gear up for the Bank of England’s next interest rate decision on Thursday.It was also little changed against the euro at 85p.The FTSE 100 has inched higher as metal miners rose on upbeat economic data from China.Base metal miners gained as much as 1pc after the upbeat industrial output and retail sales data from top metal consumer China, which in turn lifted the resource-heavy FTSE 100 by 0.1pc.Industrial output in the world’s second largest economy rose 7pc from a year earlier in February, better than analysts had forecast. Spending on factories and equipment, known as fixed-asset investments, rose 4.2pc.London’s benchmark stock index was also boosted by Reckitt Benckiser, which jumped as much as 5.9pc after slumping around 14pc on Friday after the consumer goods giant lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.Haleon was among the worst performers, down as much as 3.2pc after its top shareholder Pfizer said it would reduce its stake in the toothpaste maker from 32pc to about 24pc, selling shares worth about £2bn.The mid-cap FTSE 250 edged 0.2pc lower after an 11pc fall in Marshalls as the landscaping and roofing products supplier flagged lower revenue for 2024 on slower-than-expected recovery.Investors will watch UK inflation figures due on Wednesday, as well as interest rate decisions by the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.The Bank is widely expected to keep rates at current levels in the upcoming meeting, although the focus will be on ascertaining the timing of the first rate cut.Building materials supplier Marshalls has warned it expects the industry to remain “subdued” over the first half of 2024 and see a “slower” recovery than previously expected.It came as the London-listed company revealed a slump in profits and revenues for last year, and downgraded forecasts for 2024.Marshalls said it closed and mothballed factories and reduced shifts in other facilities in 2023 in an attempt to cut costs, leading to the loss of 330 jobs during the year. The group said this has helped the business save £11m a year.Bosses said the builders’ merchant will continue to come under pressure from the weak market, as developers slow down their building work.New chief executive Matt Pullen said:“In the short term, markets are expected to remain challenging, with continued weakness in the first half of the year followed by a progressive recovery in the second half as the macro-economic environment improves.This recovery is however expected to be slower and more modest than previously anticipated.As a result, it said sales for the full year are set to be “lower than expected” and profits are now expected to remain roughly flat. Shares dropped by 9.5pc in early trading.The FTSE 100 was little changed as trading began ahead of interest rate decisions this week from the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.The UK’s blue chip index was flat at 7,731.33 while the midcap FTSE 250 down 0.1pc at 19,492.96.Drugs giant Pfizer has announced plans to sell about £2bn of shares in Centrum vitamins maker Haleon.The US company, which has said for some time it planned to start selling down its stake, aims to offload 630m shares in the company behind Sensodyne toothpaste, which was the largest business to list in London since 2011 when it floated two years ago.Haleon, a spin-off from Pfizer’s rival pharmaceutical giant GSK, has agreed to buy £315m worth of the shares off market.The sales will reduce Pfizer’s stake from 32pc to about 24pc. It is Haleon’s largest shareholder.Commercial property giant British Land has sold a 50pc stake in a major London office months after Facebook owner Meta paid £149m to forfeit its lease at the site as its staff continue to work from home.Royal London Asset Management Property will run the eight-storey office on 1 Triton Square, near Regent’s Park, with the FTSE 250 real estate developer under a deal which values the site at £385m.Silicon Valley giant Meta still had 18 years outstanding on the office lease for the building, which it had never occupied, but paid a break fee amounting to around seven years of rent as it redesigns its offices with more shared work areas and hot-desking. Meta still uses a nearby building on Brock Street.British Land has marketed the site as a science and innovation building “in the heart of the Regent’s Place campus within London’s Knowledge Quarter”, which is home to leading research institutions including The Francis Crick Institute, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute and University College London.Chief executive Simon Carter said:We proactively took 1 Triton Square back from Meta to reposition it for science and innovation customers, with the expectation of unlocking significantly higher rents, whilst benefitting from a considerable surrender premium to further improve the economics.This transaction is another example of how we drive value through establishing innovative JV partnerships, enabling us to flex our balance sheet, share the risk and crystallise the value created from Meta’s surrender premium.Mark Evans of Royal London Asset Management Property added: “We have long recognised the demand for best-in-class science and innovation space, particularly in the Golden Triangle, and the need for this space in supporting the UK’s economic growth.Currys said profits are on track to be slightly better than expected as a bidding war for the electricals retailer came to an end.Bosses said adjusted profit before tax is expected to be at least £115m, having previously said it would come in between £105m to £115m.The company remains on track to offload its Greece business in the first half of April, which will leave the company in a net cash position at the end of the financial year.It comes after Chinese tech giant JD.com announced on Friday it would not make an offer for Currys, days after US investors Elliott Management said it would not submit a third bid to take the UK listed business private.British manufacturers are facing delays of as long as 90 days for shipments of parts caused by disruption in the Red Sea.Make UK, the manufacturing trade association, has warned of the enduring effect of attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have been targeting commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea in protest at Israeli military action in Gaza.Make UK said in its quarterly report:Manufacturers are now reporting lead times increasing on average by two to three weeks, and even upwards of 90 days in some cases.The challenge is that this creates bottlenecks across the supply chain as the delay of one component of even simple products can result in increasing lead times for goods.It comes as the trade body warned the UK’s manufacturing sector faces two years of “anaemic growth”, with the sector forecasted to grow by just 0.1pc this year and 0.6pc next - half the rate of the broader economy in 2025.Asking prices have jumped by more than £5,000 so far this month as calm in the mortgage market fosters more confidence in property values.The average price of a newly marketed house rose by 1.5pc to £368,118 in March, according to figures from Rightmove. That equates to a £5,279 increase, which markets the biggest rise in 10 months.In a further sign of recovery for the UK housing market, the number of sales being agreed has risen 13pc compared with this time last year.Tim Bannister, director of property science at Rightmove, said: “The stronger than usual price growth this March indicates that new sellers are feeling much more confident, with some perhaps being over-optimistic, that there is enough buyer activity and affordability in their local market to achieve a higher price.”London saw the biggest increase in demand for properties compared with this time last year, as slowing inflation, wage increases and a push back to offices among employers made the capital more appealing.Much of the activity in the housing market has been driven by sales of properties to wealthy buyers for whom mortgage rates are less of an issue. So-called ‘top-of-the-ladder’ sales were up 18pc in March so far compared with last year, Rightmove said.Despite March’s jump, average asking prices are still £4,776 lower than their peak in May 2023.Mr Bannister added:Despite the above-average price increases in this opening three months of the year, asking prices are still £4,776 below their peak in May 2023.For those who can afford to buy and have yet to take action to move this year, this may provide a window of opportunity to buy as we now seem to be past the bottom of the market.While some sellers are still being overoptimistic with their pricing expectations, there are also more sellers who are aware of the need to be negotiable and realistic, with elevated interest rates compared to recent years still stretching affordability for many buyers.Thanks for joining us today. An improving mortgage market has given house sellers the confidence to demand an extra £5,000 for their home on average this month compared to February.Rightmove said the value of newly marketed house has risen by 1.5pc to £368,118.1) Migration surge drives London population to new record | Concerns over housing intensify as capital surpasses pre-pandemic peak2) Hunt hits landlords with stealth capital gains tax raid | Previous reduction in tax-free allowance offsets gains from lowered rate3) ITV cuts jobs amid advertising slump | Broadcaster faces biggest slump in advertising since financial crisis4) British Airways to use robot baggage handlers at Gatwick | Driverless baggage tugs to be rolled out as industry battles staff shortages5) Why Britain’s four-day week pioneer says he will never go back | Boss of UK challenger bank Atom believes office purists need to ‘grow up’Asian stocks advanced ahead of policy decisions this week by the Bank of England, Japan’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve.Chinese data for January-February were mixed, with property investment falling while other indicators showed improvement.In Tokyo, shares closed sharply higher as investors await a decision by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday on whether to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in 17 years. Since 2016, the rate has remained at minus 0.1pc.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 2.7pc, or 1,032.80 points, to 39,740.44, while the broader Topix index climbed 1.9pc, or 51.19 points, to end at 2,721.99.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was flat at 16,720.40, and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5pc to 3,069.67.Elsewhere, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was unchanged at 7,670.60, while the Kospi in South Korea advanced 0.6pc, to 2,681.26.In India, the Sensex was unchanged and in Bangkok the SET was up 0.5pc.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/giving-oil-fantasy-says-saudi-185938914.html

2024-03-18 17:28:12+00:00,Alphabet Stock Is Soaring Today: Is It a Buy on Potential Apple News?,"Investors were delighted with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock this morning after a report that the company was in talks with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to make its Gemini AI chatbot available on the iPhone.Although talks are ongoing and no deal has been announced, the report led to a surge in Alphabet shares on Monday as investors seemed to believe it was a sign that the company was overcoming the negative publicity and other challenges that have been associated with its AI technology thus far. As of noon ET today, the stock had gained as much as 7.8%, approaching an all-time high, while Apple was up as much as 3%.Today's gain was no small move for Alphabet, which had added more than $100 billion in market cap at one point based on the report. But investors should be aware that the news has not been confirmed at this point.Bloomberg reported this morning that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for some new additions to the iPhone software later this year, though it's unlikely that a deal would be announced until June, when Apple holds its annual developer conference.Apple has also held talks with OpenAI about using its generative AI model, so it's unclear if an agreement between Apple and Alphabet will be finalized.Given the uncertainty in the partnership, the news isn't a game changer for Alphabet. But a tie-up with Apple would certainly be a big step in the right direction for the Google parent, which has stumbled with its AI strategy thus far after Bard flopped in its launch and the rebranded Gemini chatbot has faced criticism as well.Alphabet has already announced a partnership with Samsung to include its generative AI technology on its newest Galaxy phones, showing that the chatbot technology is gaining adoption.For now, the new AI technology is unlikely to be a major revenue driver for Alphabet, but establishing relationships that could become entrenched for decades is important. Keep an eye out for more news on the arrangement between the two tech leaders since it's likely to move Alphabet stock in the future.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-18 16:30:14+00:00,Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now',"It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.Commonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.Don't Miss:US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.Klein said he ""would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now"" and that Buffett ""knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.""Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.News of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.While Buffett has said that his ""favorite holding period is forever,"" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.In addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).The D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.Klein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.Dan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of ""AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).""For long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.The 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire’s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.Read More on Startup Investing:WealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.New homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market – and it sells for $5 per share.""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now' originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-03-18 15:48:17+00:00,Why Alphabet Stock Rallied Monday Morning,"Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) charged higher Monday, gaining as much as 7.8%. As of 10:49 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 7.1%.The catalyst that sent the tech giant higher was reporting that the company may have found its first big licensee for its artificial intelligence (AI) services.Alphabet is reportedly ""in active negotiations"" with Apple to license Google's Gemini to underpin certain AI-powered features in the iPhone, according to a story first reported by Bloomberg. The company may go so far as to integrate Alphabet's suite of AI tools into the device itself, according to the report, which cited ""people familiar with the situation.""If the deal comes to pass, it would be the first clear indication that Alphabet has a market for its AI services beyond its cloud infrastructure offering, Google Cloud. Any such deal would extend an existing partnership between the pair, as Apple offers Google as the default search engine within its Safari web browser.It's still early days for generative AI, and it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Just last month, Alphabet temporarily suspended Gemini's image generation capabilities when it produced inaccurate representations of historical figures. Google took the features offline and apologized, saying: ""Gemini image generation got it wrong. We'll do better."" This helps to illustrate that even the most advanced generative AI models are still a work in progress.Investors have questioned Alphabet's ability to capitalize on the AI opportunity and this is the first sure sign it's headed in the right direction. And the opportunity ahead is vast, though estimates span a wide range. Generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That said, Alphabet is still a relative bargain, selling for 26 times earnings, a discount compared to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500. A rebound in the digital advertising market -- Alphabet's bread and butter -- is ongoing, and the potential to profit from AI is significant.Now is the time to buy Alphabet stock before this fire sale is over.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-18 15:47:10+00:00,Looks like Apple will need a partner to go all in on generative AI—but big antitrust issues await,"Apple-watchers will have noted the company’s recent progression from “We’ve deployed machine learning for years and are too sui generis to talk about ‘AI’” to “We have a lot of AI stuff coming soon, honest!” But with Apple being way behind in the generative AI race it has now deigned to join, how will it catch up?According to a Bloomberg report his morning, the answer lies in partnerships—at least, for what the publication calls the “heavy lifting of generative AI,” as opposed to the on-device AI action that would presumably/hopefully power a smarter Siri. It seems Apple has considered using OpenAI’s models for image generation and the like, but “active negotiations” with Gemini proprietor Google are underway.Of course, Apple and Google have already had a close partnership for nearly two decades, around making Google the default search engine in Safari. That bond is now being frayed by pressure from antitrust regulators in the U.S. (where the Justice Department has sued Google for paying Apple and others billions of dollars to make it the search default) and in Europe (where the new Digital Markets Act has forced Apple to prompt iOS Safari users to choose which search engine they want as their default).As Bloomberg notes, a new AI deal could “help make up for” the falling value of Google and Apple’s search agreement—but it could also increase antitrust scrutiny for both companies. After all, the smartphone operating system market is essentially divided between the two companies, so having the same AI garnish on both Android and iOS could raise questions.What if Apple opts for OpenAI instead? Here, Microsoft enters into the equation. On the one hand, Microsoft’s patronage of OpenAI is also under antitrust scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, so an OpenAI-Apple deal could be quite useful in demonstrating that Sam Altman’s company is not effectively a Microsoft unit. But can you imagine if the deal were to extend to MacOS? Then the whole desktop operating system market would be powered by the same large language model.Perhaps a more durable solution would be for Apple to partner with an AI company like Anthropic or Mistral, where the potential antitrust pitfalls aren’t quite so predictable. Or maybe Apple can get its act together on developing its own models into a competitive option.Incidentally, while on the subject, there’s a new report out that says OpenAI’s models have developed prejudices against speakers of African American English, “exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement… Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death.”Apple won’t be using AI for such life-changing (or life-ending) decisions, but still, my advice would be to tread really carefully when deciding which models to use, and how to use them.

2024-03-18 15:38:15+00:00,Apple is reportedly exploring a partnership with Google for Gemini-powered feature on iPhones,"Apple is looking to team up with Google for a mega-deal to leverage the Gemini AI model for features on iPhone, Bloomberg reported. This will put Google in a commanding position as the company already has a deal with Apple as the preferred search engine provider on iPhones for the Safari browser.The publication cited people familiar with the matter saying that Apple is looking to license Google's AI tech to introduce AI-powered features with iOS updates later this year. Additionally, the company also held discussions with OpenAI to potentially use GPT models, Bloomberg said.There is surmounting pressure on Apple to catch up with competitors in the AI field such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and even Google. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company will introduce GenAI features ""later this year.""The company's job listings over the last year have suggested that Apple is working on multiple internal and external tools powered by generative AI. However, talks of leveraging third-party AI tech means Apple hasn't progressed as expected in its own AI efforts.Apple's own models might power some of the on-device features on the upcoming iOS 18 software update — expected to be announced at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) historically held in June. However, the company is exploring partnering with an external provider for generative AI use cases such as image creation and helping users with writing.Google has had its own set of problems with Gemini. Last month, the company had to pause its image-generation feature after the model created images with historical inaccuracies. Later, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini's responses were ""completely unacceptable."" Last week, Google said that it is blocking election-related queries on Gemini across the globe. But TechCrunch found that users could get around those restrictions by introducing typos to some queries.Despite these fallbacks, Google has an advantage in launching smartphone-related features. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Samsung to introduce Gemini-powered AI features on the Galaxy S24 series of devices. The search giant has also launched these features on its own Pixel series of phones.We have reached out to Apple and Google for a comment, and we will update the story if we hear back from them.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/17/apple-is-reportedly-exploring-a-partnership-with-google-for-gemini-powered-feature-on-iphones/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reportedly-exploring-partnership-google-061906606.html
2024-03-18 15:26:03+00:00,"Beyond Google talks, Apple needs to 'catch up' on AI development","According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) is currently in talks with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to use its generative AI engine, Google Gemini, in iPhones. Oppenheimer Senior Analyst of Emerging Technologies and Services Martin Yang joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the reported talks and Apple's position within the AI sector.For the partnership to be successful for both companies, Yan states, ""it will require a lot of nuance on how the large language models or gen AI functions will be implemented because it can augment search capabilities, but there are also a large number of applications it can use. One example would be simulating communication to copilot for the productivity applications from Apple, similar to Microsoft's (MSFT) implementation of copilot for its Office suite.

This is according to a report from Bloomberg. This comes after Apple also reportedly held conversations with OpenAI to use its product. For more on what this could mean for the tech giants and the broader industry, we want to bring in Martin Yang. He's Oppenheimer's senior analyst of emerging technologies and services. Martin, it's good to see you. So just first, your reaction to this report, and if it's true, how big of a deal this is for Apple?MARTIN YANG: This is a very big deal for Apple because it removes the near-term concern that Apple cannot implement any GenAI functions on iPhone due to its lack of infrastructure investments relative to other large tech companies. And then, I think, it positions the iPhone, at least in the near-term, to be the go-to device to interact with large language models.BRAD SMITH: And so additionally, Martin, when you think about the fact that Google Alphabet is going to pick up a potential win on this as well, I mean, what is it going to take for this to be successful as both of these companies would want it to be?MARTIN YANG: I think it will require a lot of nuance on how the large language models or GenAI functions will be implemented because it can augment search capabilities, but there are also a large number of applications they can use. One example will be a similar implementation to Copilot for the productivity functions-- productivity applications from Apple similar to Microsoft implementation of Copilot for Office suite.SEANA SMITH: Martin, what does it tell us, though, about Apple's internal efforts, because there has been some optimism, some chatter, especially over the last couple of weeks, just about what they are doing and how much they are investing in their own AI efforts? Is that maybe not as far as some had anticipated it was up until this point?MARTIN YANG: Right. We believe that there's a ketchup Apple needs to do to build up its own infrastructure to train large language models because the short supply of GPU cards from NVIDIA. And in the-- maybe in the near-term, I think, there's a way for Apple to implement on-device AIs using Apple Silicon, but those are not the equivalent of OpenAI's GPT-4 or Gemini in the near-term.BRAD SMITH: Martin, do you think about what generative AI could be for the next supercycle for iPhones and for Apple specifically? What type of material difference are you expecting as consumers try to get their hands on the latest cutting-edge technology there?MARTIN YANG: Sure, I think there are a couple of ways for us to get excited about the next generation iPhone with more capable AI functions. Number one will be Siri becomes real, really helpful to the users. Right now, it's really handicapped, and by-- Siri right now is referring to, telling us about weather, telling us our time, setting timers.And I think the next iteration of Siri augmented by AI could be becomes really helpful as an agent will help us navigate through multiple apps and then getting a real bookings for hotels, reservations, and restaurants, and then getting us really a real-world applications of things we could do with iPhones, you know, where the interface becomes voice and as opposed to touch and other controls.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/beyond-google-talks-apple-needs-152603132.html
2024-03-18 15:06:04+00:00,"Apple in talks to let Google's Gemini power iPhone AI features, Bloomberg News says","By Martin Coulter(Reuters) -Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.The negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided.Alphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%.It is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report.Apple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.""This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush.""This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,"" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters.Google in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out.Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.(Reporting by Jahnavi Nidumolu and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Janane Venkatraman, Varun H K and Susan Fenton)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-talks-let-googles-gemini-054341739.html

2024-03-18 14:00:02+00:00,Examining Buffett's 'Indefinite' Stocks,"To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What's needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework."" - Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRGO.In his recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) identified three stocks as well as five Japanese companies which the conglomerate intends to hold ""indefinitely."" This is close enough to ""forever"" as far as I am concerned for the purpose of this discussion. The reason is these companies are hugely successful in their base businesses, are enduring, scalable and leave him feeling ""comfortable."" The last point is an important if underappreciated quality in choosing stocks to own. You want to avoid investments that cause you stress and keep you up at night. This discussion explores these Buffett ""forever"" stocks using GuruFocus data and I offer my opinion if they are still worth buying at current prices.Additionally, as he recalled Charlie Munger advising him, after he took control of Berkshire and relocated it from New England to Omaha, that he should forget about ""owning fair stocks at wonderful prices,"" but focus on ""owning wonderful stocks at fair prices."" I think we can be certain these businesses are wonderful as Berkshire owns them, but are the prices still ""fair?"" And if so, does it make sense to still buy them?The first company Buffett identified is Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). GuruFocus data shows the stock to be modestly undervalued and fits with Munger's definition of a wonderful business at a fair price.Buffett mentioned in his letter that Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta drug store in 1886, quipping that Berkshire is not big on newcomers.Coca-Cola is a business with high predictability and low capital intensity. It is global in its scope. People are used to drinking its products and are expected to keep on consuming them for decades to come. Drinking carbonated beverages is unlikely to go out of fashion. Technological disruptions such as artificial intelligence do not fundamentally threaten the business, but can enhance it. The company's return on invested capital consistently exceeds its weighted average cost of capital. Berkshire owns about 9% of Coke's outstanding shares.Overall, I think Coca-Cola is still a buy. It is a ""sleep well at night"" stock that will continue compounding in the future.The GF Value chart shows American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence.Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion.These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace.Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy.Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (TSE:8031) is one of the oldest sogo-shosha companies, with its roots tracing back to the Edo period. Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy.Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles.The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:TickerCompanyCurrent Price (Yen)Market Cap($M)EV-to-EBITDAPE RatioFCF Yield %DividendYield %TSE:8001Itochu Corp6,38562,439.738.3212.717.862.43TSE:8031Mitsui & Co Ltd6,52266,234.077.419.758.752.45TSE:8058Mitsubishi Corp3,23590,633.058.5314.957.472.14TSE:8053Sumitomo Corp3,46228,690.407.928.429.933.47TSE:8002Marubeni Corp2,43427,650.447.249.148.073.37Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate.Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares.The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat.Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory.So that's it folks. These are Buffett's ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns.The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/examining-buffetts-indefinite-stocks-140002079.html
2024-03-18 13:46:54+00:00,AI in iPhones? Apple in talks with Google,"Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to potentially incorporate Google's ""Gemini"" generative AI engine into its iPhones, according to a Bloomberg report. Apple had previously engaged in talks with OpenAI for a similar potential partnership.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith discuss past deals between Apple and Google, and how generative AI may be embedded in the devices.more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith- All right. Well, Apple reportedly in talks with Google to use its generative AI engine Gemini on its iPhones. This is according to a report from Bloomberg. Now, this comes after Apple also reportedly held conversations with OpenAI to use its product.Now, this is huge news within the AI space, really within the tech space more broadly here, Brad. If in fact this partnership does go through, it really totally would shake up the AI world. A couple of things, though to bring up. Obviously, a partnership here with Apple and Google, it would be a huge advantage for Google.You're getting access, you're getting exposure to the number of users that Apple has. But it also brings up the fact that, hey, maybe Apple isn't as advanced as many thought that they might have been potentially up until this point on some of their AI efforts. So you've got to also question what this could mean for AI and-- for Apple, excuse me, and their AI plans more broadly speaking in the longer run.- Yeah. Putting generative AI at the fingertips of those two billion devices that are out in the market for Apple iPhones here. And it's important to also note that these companies have had deals in the past, whether that's for search on the iPhones. We do know that Google is the default search engine.And then you can go in and kind of download your other search engines as well, whatever you would like to use on most of these devices. But this is really critical, I think, for how the data sharing as well across both of these companies would move forward. Because you do have a trove of data that would be indexed as you would perceive for any generative AI type of Copilot or tool that would be embedded within it or if it's just embedded within some of the existing operating systems and apps that are on there.I don't know how they're going to go about doing this. But it's another reason for me to perhaps delay upgrading my iPhone, which we've already-- you've seen my cracked screen every day. At this juncture, I'm just waiting for the next generative AI major announcement to come forward so that I know that that's the device that I have to get into here.- Yeah, exactly. And I think a lot of people are out there scratching their heads trying to figure out exactly what this means, what the technology is going to behold, whether or not they should be staying on the sidelines and waiting for these new applications and what exactly that would then enable some of these iPhones to do. But real quick, just looking at this early, reaction that we're getting from some analysts out there.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives saying that this strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy. It's a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem. Similar to what we were talking about just a second ago there, Brad.And then Melius Research was also saying that this news represents a bigger immediate win for Apple who can use that asset light approach to aspects of its AI strategy, and then therefore potentially acquire another form of overall traffic acquisition payments there. So they're viewing it as a huge win here for Apple and for Alphabet. And then that's a big reason why we're seeing both of these stocks move to the upside here in pre-market trading.- Yeah, huge move for Alphabet. And that-- this is now access into a device ecosystem that you didn't necessarily-- and outside of the existing partnerships, you were looking to expand upon more. And so for Google and Alphabet, what they've been able to do with the Android OS. And they've already got that's part of the market. Now, it's just about, OK, how do we get even more entrenchment into the Apple operating system, an ecosystem that we don't power but we can be a net benefactor of as well.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/ai-iphones-apple-talks-google-134654600.html

2024-03-18 13:00:15+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-18 11:00:49+00:00,Apple Without AI Looks More Like Coca-Cola Than High-Growth Tech,"(Bloomberg) — For two decades, no company better embodied the promise of the stock market than Apple Inc. Its transformation from niche computer maker to the most valuable corporation on the planet made its shares a cornerstone of investment portfolios worldwide.Most Read from BloombergPutin Warns Russia Won’t Stop After Predictable Election WinApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI FeaturesSaudi Wealth Fund Is in Talks to Acquire National AirlineChina’s Growth Bump May Dent Urgency for More StimulusBut in what seems like a blink of an eye, Apple’s sheen is starting to fade. Artificial intelligence is the story in technology now, driving the kind of growth that the company used to count on from selling its gadgets and services to eager consumers across the globe.This has Apple investors in a quandary. Its revenue expansion is stagnating, and the stock is underperforming the Nasdaq 100 by about 16 percentage points, the most to start a year since 2013. The company still generates massive revenues, but whether that can keep increasing at the pace investors have come to expect is an open question. Apple executives say they have big plans for AI, which bulls hope will help revive growth. But so far it’s hard to gauge its prospects.All of which has investors wondering, if Apple’s AI dreams don’t come to fruition, what is the role of the shares today?“It’s become more of a value stock, a bit like Coca-Cola,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management and chief market strategist at Osaic. “All the things you want that’s going to offer you a defensive profile and market rate returns for the foreseeable future until they have a new catalyst.”Apple remains the reliable money machine it’s always been. It’s certainly a shareholder-friendly cash flow juggernaut, and a safe haven with a bulletproof balance sheet.“If you’re a long-term investor that really likes solid, stable growth, that’s very annuity like, with growing margins, improving profitability and a business that generates significant amounts of cash and still has lots of innovation runway, we think Apple is a great place to be,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.But investors looking to buy into the next big growth market have turned their attention to AI. Nvidia Corp. is taking Apple’s place as the tech behemoth to own due to the seemingly insatiable demand for chips used to power large language models.Valuation wipeoutApple has fallen more than 10% this year, erasing around $330 billion in market capitalization, and ceding its position as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp., whose incorporation of ChatGPT into products like its Office software is starting to boost revenue growth. Microsoft now has a market value of almost $3.1 trillion versus Apple’s $2.7 trillion. Nvidia, whose revenue and profits have soared amid an arms race for AI computing power, isn’t far behind at $2.2 trillion.Read More: Microsoft Dethrones Apple as Most Valuable Stock in the WorldThe problem isn’t so much that Apple has suddenly stopped growing, that’s been happening for a while — its revenue shrank in every quarter of its last fiscal year even as the stock was hitting records. The trouble is the company hasn’t shown anything on AI at a time when iPhones sales are sluggish and the company is facing mounting regulatory threats.“We’re going through an incredible wave of innovation,” said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities. “The market is telling you that Apple has a lot to prove here and to date they haven’t shown much.”Notoriously secretive, Apple has divulged little about its plans to incorporate AI services into its products. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple would “break new ground” in AI this year and market professionals are anticipating big news at the company’s annual software developer’s conference in a few months. However, many investors are losing patience and turning to stocks with a clearer path in AI.Read More: Apple Buys Canadian AI Startup as Part of Race to Add FeaturesAt the core of Apple’s woes is the disappearance of revenue growth and it’s unclear what, if anything, will stoke it. The company’s first major new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro headset, isn’t expected to contribute significantly to growth for years. Apple recently pulled the plug on its long effort to build an electric car. At the same time iPhone revenue has stagnated and sales in China have dropped amid a weak economy and greater competition.Regulatory pressuresOn top of that Apple is facing mounting pressure from regulators. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion by the European Union over an investigation into claims it blocked music-streaming rivals on its platforms. In the US, the Justice Department appears close to filing an antitrust lawsuit after five years of work building a case alleging Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads to impede competition from rivals.Sales in fiscal 2023 fell 3% and are projected to rise just 2% in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, revenue expanded at a 33% clip in 2021. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s sales are projected to jump 79% and Microsoft’s 15% in the companies’ current fiscal years.For the past couple of years, Apple has commanded a premium valuation on par with Microsoft’s. Two years ago, when tech stocks got hit hard, the shares held up far better than those of its peers. But that’s no longer the case. Apple is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from about 30 times last summer. That’s similar to Walmart Inc.‘s valuation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is priced at 32 times and Nvidia at 35 times.Read More: Apple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftThat said, Microsoft trading at a record high may actually offer a good example of Apple’s long-term potential. When Satya Nadella took over the company in 2014 it was a software maker with a 20th century mindset and a languishing stock. Now it’s everywhere, from the cloud to AI, and its stock is soaring.“Everyone has to reinvent themselves, and it just shows you how quick the revolution in tech is,” Citizens JMP’s Lehmann said. “Microsoft finally got going, but it took them 15 years to figure it out.”Despite this year’s gloomy performance, it’s easy to make the case that Apple shares are poised for a rebound and that it’s too early to count it out of the AI race. The company has more than $170 billion in cash on its balance sheet and its net income is expected to top $100 billion this year. That gives Apple unmatched resources to push into new markets and still return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.“It’s hard to not compare to what’s the hot thing right now,” Jensen Investment Management’s Walkush said. “If you took AI out of the picture right now, and the sensationalism, would people look at Apple differently? I think they would.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekDollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and AbroadAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of TrollsAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American BuyersGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-without-ai-looks-more-120000208.html
2024-03-18 10:59:20+00:00,Google in talks to put AI chatbot on every iPhone despite diversity row,"Google and Apple are in talks over a deal that could see the search engine’s chatbot technology installed on every iPhone, despite a row over the system’s excessive efforts to promote diversity.The two tech giants are in discussions over licensing parts of Google’s Gemini bot for the iPhone’s built-in AI tools such as its Siri assistant, Bloomberg reported.Google shares rose by 6.6pc on Monday in response to the news, with a potential deal being seen as a major boost to its AI business.A deal would be a major boost to Google, whose chatbot has been under fire for returning allegedly biased answers to questions and for publishing “diverse” images of historical figures by depicting white figures such as Nazi soldiers and Vikings as black.Apple has been developing its own AI features for the next version of the iPhone’s operating system, including a version of Siri powered by “generative AI” technology similar to chatbots such as Gemini and ChatGPT.However, its technology is believed to be far behind competitors, meaning it may have to outsource some queries. The Gemini technology could be used to answer questions when Apple’s own systems do not have the answers, for example.However, a partnership would potentially raise concerns about whether it will mean Google has access to iPhone users’ data.It may also draw regulators’ attention. Google already pays Apple an estimated $18bn (£14bn) a year to be the default search engine on the iPhone’s Safari web browser, an arrangement that the US Department of Justice has sued Google over on anti-monopoly grounds.The company has been scrambling to control the damage caused by an online backlash against Gemini. Last month it suspended the bot’s image generation feature after it was found to return images of native American Vikings, black Nazi soldiers and female popes, and also changed text responses after it failed to condemn paedophilia and refused to say whether Adolf Hitler or Elon Musk had done more harm.Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has called the responses “completely unacceptable” while Sergey Brin, its co-founder, admitted that it “leans Left” in many cases.Apple has also held discussions with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, according to Bloomberg.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has promised the company will “break new ground” in AI this year, despite perceptions it is playing catch-up with the likes of Google and OpenAI.It is likely to announce the new AI features at its annual developer conference in June, where the company typically unveils updates to the iPhone operating system before their release in September.Google did not comment while Apple did not respond to a request for comment.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

2024-03-18 06:47:41+00:00,"UPDATE 3-Apple in talks to let Google's Gemini power iPhone AI features, Bloomberg News says","(Adds details in paragraph 10, background in paragraph 10)March 18 (Reuters) - Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.Apple also recently held discussions with the Microsoft -backed OpenAI and has considered using its model, the report added.Apple is preparing new capabilities as part of its upcoming iPhone iOS 18 based on its own homegrown AI models, but it is seeking a partner to power generative AI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts, the report said.The two parties have not decided the terms or branding of an AI agreement or finalised how it would be implemented, Bloomberg said, adding it was unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.Apple, Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company plans to disclose later this year more about its plans to put generative AI to use, adding that the company is investing ""significantly"" in the area.Apple and Google already have an existing deal that lets Google be the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser.However, the deal has been under regulatory scrutiny as the United States and its state allies contend that Google unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple and other business partners to ensure its search engine would be the default on most phones and web browsers.Google also partnered with Samsung in January to deploy multiple generative AI technology products in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones.

2024-03-18 06:30:51+00:00,Qualcomm debuts AI-focused Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip,"Qualcomm (QCOM) is pushing deeper into the generative AI space with its latest smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. The processor, which will be available in Android smartphones from Chinese manufacturers including Xiaomi and Honor, is the second addition to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 family.Like the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm is marketing the 8s Gen 3 as an on-device AI powerhouse. The company says that the processor supports a number of models, including Meta's Llama 2 and Google's Gemini Nano.The 8s Gen 3 places just below the standard 8 Gen 3 in terms of performance and pricing, meaning you'll likely find it in smartphones that are just under flagship devices. The company says it's taken a number of the major features from the top-of-the-line 8 Gen 3 and dropped them into the 8s Gen 3, including high-powered gaming performance.But Qualcomm is largely positioning this chip as a generative AI processor. So far, on-device generative AI features include photo editing and real-time translation. Smartphone makers are increasingly leaning into the technology as a major selling point as the first major software change for devices in some time.The smartphone market has largely remained stagnant over the last few years, with only incremental changes to cameras and processing speeds. As a result, consumers are more apt to hold onto their devices for longer periods of time, slowing down overall sales.Generative AI, however, could be just what the market needs: a new, flashy capability that gets consumers to update their phones as faster clips.Android smartphone makers are taking an early lead with the technology, with both Samsung and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touting their latest offerings as generative AI-capable devices. Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI software during its WWDC developer conference, which will likely take place in June.Wall Street analysts are pointing to generative AI as a potential catalyst for a boost in Apple's next-generation iPhone sales. And while the company hasn't made any announcements regarding what it's cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said he sees generative AI as a ""huge opportunity for Apple"" and that the iPhone maker will show off what it's been developing later this year.But generative AI apps and features are still in their early stages, and there's nothing quite interesting enough on the market yet to get people to start running out their front doors and into their nearest smartphone shops.And some of the most well-known generative AI apps like ChatGPT are cloud-based, meaning it doesn't matter what kind of chip your smartphone is running; as long as you've got a connection to the internet, you'll likely be able to use the service.Still, as developers continue to develop the technology and roll it into more and more apps, chips capable of running them, like the 8s Gen 3, will become increasingly important for users who want to take advantage of the software.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now.As the US economy continues to settle down, financial professionals are continuing to keep a close eye on the inflation numbers and what they may imply for the markets and investors moving forward. Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:""Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.  On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the ""Halftime Report"" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:""The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.""These comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today. As such, our list below contains many of the fastest growing technology companies in the US, alongside some of the best American tech stocks to buy.A financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.Our Methodology For our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds now, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter and selected the top 20 stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is a systems software company based in Austin, Texas. It offers products and services addressing enterprise information technology environments worldwide, such as cloud software applications.Argus Research analysts hold a Buy rating on Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of March 14.There were 100 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $6.4 billion.Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is among the most owned stocks by hedge funds today.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 4.5 million shares.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a healthcare company that discovers and develops human pharmaceuticals across the globe. It is based in Indianapolis, Indiana and is among the most owned stocks by hedge funds today.An Overweight rating and $850 price target were maintained on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) on March 15 by JPMorgan analysts.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was seen in the portfolios of 102 hedge funds in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $11.2 billion.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company that develops diabetes, oncology, immunology and neuroscience medicines. The company generates over half of its revenue in the U.S. from its top-selling drugs Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz. The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.Eli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We belief the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103We saw 103 hedge funds long JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NYSE:JPM).Carillon Tower Advisers said the following about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“PNC Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105An Outperform rating and $610 price target were maintained on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) on March 15 by BMO Capital analysts.Adobe Inc.

Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth. As such, we remain investors but have reduced our position as we monitor further progress.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) on March 11.Jackson Peak Capital mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 129At the end of the fourth quarter, 129 hedge funds were long Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with a total stake value of $8.7 billion.Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a passenger ground transportation company and among the most owned stocks by hedge funds this year. It develops and operates proprietary tech applications across the globe, offering ride-hailing services to customers worldwide.On March 15, Piper Sandler analysts maintained an Overweight rating and a $92 price target on Uber Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:UBER) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Based in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc.

However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.On March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:""We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.""According to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:""Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.""These ""winning"" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:""I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.""Investors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in.Photo by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur Methodology We selected the high growth stocks for our list below by consulting the holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF and shortlisting 11 stocks with the highest share price gains over a 5-year period as of March 16.

2024-03-17 14:15:00+00:00,"Nvidia Is the Best-Performing ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock: Here's Why I Wouldn't Buy","The aptly named ""Magnificent Seven"" is a group of (mostly) technology companies that have generally delivered above-average returns, especially over the past decade. Here is every member of this clique: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Though all have been admirable in delivering outsize returns, one of them, Nvidia, is in a class of its own.None of the other Magnificent Seven members even get close to Nvidia's performance in the past 10 years. Yet, I still wouldn't invest in this company.When shares of companies rise as much as Nvidia's have, one of the first problems investors tend to think of is valuation. It's often the case that these corporations' future success is baked into their stock prices. Their shares will drop if they fail to live up to the market's lofty expectations. That may be the case with Nvidia, but that's not my rationale for staying away.There is a simple and straightforward reason I wouldn't invest in Nvidia stock: My knowledge of the company's business is practically nonexistent. Nvidia is the leading player in manufacturing graphic processing units, critical electronic device components. This sounds like a great business model, but that is about the extent of my expertise, or lack thereof, in this area.So, while Nvidia looks like a terrific company from an outsider's perspective, considering just how successful it has been over the past decade, I am in no mood to invest. Warren Buffett, the world's greatest investor, once said: ""Investment must be rational; if you can't understand it, don't do it.""For what it's worth, I would also avoid investing in Tesla for the same reason. Am I missing out on some massive gains as a result? It's hard to say. If I made it a habit to invest in businesses I know nothing about, I might end up with some excellent stocks that have performed splendidly, like Nvidia and Tesla. But this approach would almost certainly result in some terrible investments, too.It's unclear whether the net effect on my overall returns would be positive. Thankfully, the rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks are all businesses I understand reasonably well. All of them, I think, are worth serious consideration. Let's pick Apple as an example. Though not as impressive as Nvidia's over the past decade, Apple's returns have also been excellent.Further, the company has strong growth prospects. The iPhone is no longer the growth driver it used to be, but underestimating Apple's innovative capabilities would be a mistake. After all, the company didn't create cellphones -- it just made better versions of them and made a fortune in the process.Apple's habit of creating a better mousetrap is well established. It now aims to do the same within generative artificial intelligence. Apple is trailing some of its peers in this area, but that has never stopped the company. Then, there is Apple's services segment, with an installed base of more than 2 billion active devices. The company has enough flexibility to monetize its user base in various ways.The sky is the limit for Apple despite its recent slowing top-line growth. In my view, the company's shares still look like a buy. I'd say the same about Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Here's the lesson for investors: Missing out on some potentially amazing companies due to a lack of understanding regarding how they make money is not the end of the world.There will always be other exciting stocks on the market whose businesses are much more comprehensible to each investor.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-17 11:09:00+00:00,"It's Time for This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock to Join Its Rivals and Start Contributing to This $1.7 Trillion Payout","Last year, companies around the world paid a record $1.7 trillion in dividends to their shareholders, a 5% increase from the prior year. Leading the way were tech titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) at $20.7 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively. Dividend payments are likely to set a new record this year. One catalyst is that fellow tech titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) initiated a dividend, which should total more than $5 billion this year. It's now the fourth member, along with Nvidia, of the vaunted ""Magnificent Seven"" to join the bandwagon of dividend-paying stocks. Among the holdouts is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). It's high time for the search giant to start paying dividends. Here's why.Microsoft, Apple, and Meta Platforms can afford to pay massive dividends because they generate huge cash flows. Over the past six months, Microsoft has produced $49.4 billion in operating cash flow. It returned $19.5 billion to shareholders through dividend payments ($10.6 billion) and share repurchases ($8.8 billion). Apple is also a cash flow machine. It generated $39.9 billion in cash from operating activities in its fiscal first quarter. It paid $3.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $20.1 billion in stock. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms produced $40.8 billion in net cash from operating activities last year and used $20 billion to repurchase shares. Alphabet is just as good at generating cash as its dividend-paying Magnificent Seven peers. Last year, the search giant produced a prodigious $101.7 billion in net cash from operating activities. While the company didn't use any of that money to pay dividends, it did return $61.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases. However, the company could easily follow Meta's approach when it initiated its dividend earlier this year. CFO Susan Li commented on Meta's new dividend policy on the fourth-quarter earnings conference call:Aside from organic investments, returning capital to shareholders remains important to us. We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time. We've historically done so through share repurchases, and while we expect to maintain an active share repurchase program, we are modestly evolving our approach going forward by returning a portion of capital through a regular dividend. Another reason tech titans Microsoft, Apple, and now Meta Platforms are paying dividends is that they have a lot of cash on their balance sheets.Magnificent Seven Dividend StockCash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term InvestmentsTotal Debt OutstandingNet Cash PositionApple$172.6 billion$108 billion$64.6 billionMicrosoft$81 billion$74.2 billion$7 billionMeta Platforms$65.4 billion$18.4 billion$47 billionData sources: Company websites. Data as of the end of 2023. Apple's net cash position alone could fund its current dividend outlay for more than four years, while Meta's would last nearly a decade.Alphabet has an equally enormous cash position. It ended last year with $110.9 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against only $13.3 billion in debt. Like its peers, Alphabet produces more cash than it needs to grow its business. The money it doesn't return to shareholders through buybacks is piling up on its balance sheet. While the company might be strategically holding cash to make a sizable acquisition, that seems unlikely, since mergers and acquisitions aren't a big part of its growth strategy. The company's biggest deal was its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Other notable deals were relatively smaller including Nest at $3.2 billion in 2014, Fitbit at $2.1 billion in 2021, and YouTube at $1.7 billion in 2005. Between that and the increased regulatory scrutiny of acquisitions in the tech sector, Alphabet probably won't use its cash position to make a big deal. That leaves returning it to shareholders as the most likely outcome. On one hand, it's hard to argue with its share repurchase program. Alphabet has reduced its outstanding shares by 10% over the past five years, second only to Apple in this group. Alphabet could buy back even more shares, which wouldn't be a bad idea, since it has the lowest forward P/E ratio in this group at 21. However, a dividend could broaden its appeal to more investors, which could boost its valuation. Meanwhile, paying a dividend would put cash in the pockets of long-term holders, not those selling shares to Alphabet as part of the repurchases. Microsoft and Apple pay their investors billions of dollars in dividends each year. Meta is joining them this year. It's time for Alphabet to get on board, too. Like its peers, it produces massive cash flows, which are piling up on its balance sheet. It really doesn't have much use for that money, other than returning it to investors. While its buyback is doing a good job, the company can easily squeeze in a dividend to provide its investors with a little income.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-17 06:30:00+00:00,"2 Cheap ""Tech"" Stocks to Buy Right Now","The word ""cheap"" doesn't get applied to many tech stocks these days, especially after a rally that has seen the Nasdaq Composite index soar by 46% in the past year. And it's true that you'll have to pay much more for quality businesses today than you would have shelled out back in early 2023.That's the price an investor must pay for a brighter sentiment on Wall Street. As billionaire Warren Buffett pointed out in 2008, ""If you wait for the robins, spring will be over.""Still, there are always relative values in the market, especially if your investing time frame stretches across decades. Let's look at two attractively priced ""tech"" stocks (see below for an explanation of why ""tech"" is in quotes).Unlike software rival Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't in the $3 trillion market valuation club right now. That's mainly because the iPhone maker's shares have underperformed the market by a wide margin in recent months. The stock is up just 16% in the past year compared to Microsoft's 66% spike.That gap sets up a potentially attractive buying opportunity for patient investors.Sure, Apple is going through a bit of a slump right now. Sales barely grew last quarter, rising just 2% year over year compared to Microsoft's 16% surge. Growth prospects don't look particularly encouraging for the next year or so, either. Most Wall Street pros are looking for about a 6% sales uptick next year following modest declines in fiscal 2024.Consider the value you get from owning Apple during this time of elevated pessimism, though. The stock is valued at just 7 times annual sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 14. Apple prioritizes ample cash returns, too, with $27 billion heading directly to shareholders last quarter alone in the form of share buybacks and dividends.These cash returns, which mainly arrive through buybacks, should continue helping earnings per share outpace sales growth in 2024 and beyond. That will be a nice buffer for shareholders as they wait for Apple's new product releases -- along with its push into more services -- to reaccelerate growth.I know it might seem like a stretch to call Walmart (NYSE: WMT) a tech stock, but hear me out. The retailer just finished a fantastic year that saw e-commerce grow by 23% to cross $100 billion in annual sales. For context, Amazon grew its product sales by 5% in 2023, up to $256 billion; eBay reported $73 billion of annual sales volume.Walmart is also getting more revenue growth from other tech sources like its surging digital advertising business. It's little surprise, then, that profit margins are rising. The chain achieved 10% higher operating income last year, outpacing Walmart's 6% revenue uptick.Even with strong growth in its tech-focused segments, traditional retailing will be the main show at Walmart for the foreseeable future. The good news is that this division is firing on all cylinders, too. Customer traffic was up a healthy 4% year over year in the holiday period, customer satisfaction levels are rising, and the chain is snapping up market share in groceries and consumer discretionary products, including from higher-income shoppers.You can own Walmart stock for a P/S below 1, or about the same valuation that you would pay for Target stock right now. That price seems like a great deal for a quickly growing e-commerce business that's supported by a dominant brick-and-mortar enterprise.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-16 20:10:06+00:00,50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US,"In this article, we list and discuss the 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the population change and growth trends in the States, you can go directly to 10 Cities With The Largest Population In The US.The United States of America is a nation characterized by its vastness in terms of land, diversity, and population. With a total land area of over 3 million square miles, 50 states, and 19,495 incorporated cities, towns, and villages, the US is the fifth largest nation in terms of area worldwide. If we look at the population, according to Census Data, the country is home to a diverse population of 331,449,281 people. While the largest city in the US by area is Juneau, Alaska, the city only houses a population of 31,685. On the other hand, the largest city by population houses over eight million people, and is significantly smaller than Juneau in terms of land area. In other words, similar to the rest of the world, the population distribution in the US is not even.The Census Bureau projects that in the next 57 years, by 2080, the nation’s population is expected to increase by another 35 million and reach the figure of 370 million. However, by 2100, the United States will see a rapid population decline, losing 10 million people within twenty years. Note that mortality rates are not the only factor that affects the population of a place — in the case of the States, the population trends will be greatly influenced in the coming years by the nation’s decreased fertility rates, aging population, and growing international migration trends. Although already uneven, the population distribution within the US is expected to change even more in the coming years. Forecasts suggest that the suburban and rural areas will see a rise in population, while the urban centers will see a notable decline. Mostly, this is because of the US’s aging population, and economic factors like inflation.Given this factor, while the overall US population is expected to decline by the end of this century, there will be significant population distribution shifts as well. Some US cities will experience significant population growth, while others will see a sharp decline. As of 2024, the US cities with the largest population decline include Paradise, Nevada, and Jackson, Mississippi. (See also: 15 Biggest US Cities Facing Depopulation by 2100) On the other hand, according to the most recent Census data, the cities with the largest population growth include Dallas and other Texas cities.  Some global key players also happen to have a significant presence in the largest cities in the US. For example, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, with the population distribution changes and overall population decline in the country, all companies may experience an eventual decline in the workforce. However, leading companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple have already started investing in innovation and technology, especially AI, so they may not be as significantly impacted by the future decline in population as one would think.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has made some notable investments in innovation and technology projects, such as Artificial Intelligence, to yield more efficiency and productivity. Last year in 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $13 billion in OpenAI, integrating AI technology into its Bing search engine, GitHub coding tools, Azure Cloud, sales and marketing software, and more.Similarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a world leader in the smartphone industry, is also investing hugely in generative AI technology, Tim Cook, the CEO, said in the annual shareholder meeting. He further stated in the virtual meeting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will break new grounds with generative AI and assist in productivity, problem-solving, and more.On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has established a $1 billion venture investment program, supporting emerging technology companies with direct investments. As the company prioritizes productivity, it has made close to a dozen investments in companies with promising automating products, such as Rightbot.  Overall, today, the presence of giant companies in the major cities in the US contributes to the economic growth and development of the cities and the country at large. Below, we discuss the cities with the largest population in the US as of 2024.50 Cities With The Largest Population In The USFor our list of the largest U.S. cities by population, we have sourced data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, and World Population Review (for Nashville city estimates only). Note that based on the most recent available data provided by the Census, our list is based on the 2022 estimates. For city-specific information mentioned in our list, we have sourced data from the US Census Bureau Quick Facts table. The list is in descending order, going from the 50th most populous US city to the 1st most populated one.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

2024-03-16 19:05:00+00:00,"Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock?","March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.Given Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy.Nvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion.The only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.The easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.Nvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.Nvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.Nvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.So why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.Market sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.The abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.Piper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.Investors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.The pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.Apple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.Nvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.Meanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.I don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.Nvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-16 15:19:59+00:00,15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most,"In this article, we will be analyzing the population dynamics in the US and the 15 US cities where the population decreased the most. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most.The United States ranks among the most populous countries worldwide. As reported by the US Census Bureau, the country’s population is 336,167,022, as of March 14. Region-wise, the South accounted for 38.9% of the population growth in 2023. Population growths of 23.6% for the West, 20.6% for the Midwest, and 17% for the Northeast were reported in 2023. Some of the most populous US states include California, Texas, Florida, and New York. You can also take a look at the most densely populated cities in the US.2022 showed the first signs of US recovery from the global pandemic in terms of population growth. This was when the US population was reported to have increased by 0.4%. The primary driver of this growth was the net international migration which added 1,010,923 people to the national population.Future prediction represents a slow-paced population growth for the country over the coming years. On November 9, 2023, the US Census Bureau reported that the US population has been forecasted to approach almost 370 million in 2080 before moving downward to 366 million in 2100. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth. Simultaneously, a natural decrease in the country’s population will be supported by declining fertility rates and an aging population. The reduced fertility rates will also impact the nation’s age structure, leading to more adults aged 65 and above as compared to children under the age of 18.One year into the pandemic, the US Census Bureau reported that some of the fastest-growing US cities during the pre-pandemic period, witnessed slower growth rates after the pandemic. Population growth especially slowed in the cities of Leander in Texas and Meridian in Idaho.With respect to the fastest declining cities, San Fransisco ranked at the top in 2021 when it was not even a part of the list in 2019. Even for the city of Cupertino which had been a declining city in both 2019 and 2021, the drop in its population growth was almost triple. Overall, six of the top fifteen declining cities were based in California. The largest numeric decrease in population was recorded in New York City, San Fransisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles.A recent study reveals that almost half of the 30,000 US cities will be subject to depopulation by 2100. This study initially began as a project commissioned by the Illinois Department of Transportation to carry out an analysis of the challenges in transportation that could arise from population changes in Illinois. However, a deeper analysis showed that the biggest population losses will be taking place in the Northeast and Midwest of the country as the population moves to the South and West. States such as Texas and Utah where the population tends to be growing as of now, will be seeing a fair share of their cities undergoing depopulation in the future. The population will also be declining in the cities situated in Illinois, Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Michigan. Overall, some sort of depopulation has been forecasted for all US states except for the District of Columbia and Hawaii.California is home to a majority of cities where the population has decreased the most in recent years. It is an important US state in terms of business as well. The state boasts a robust technology sector. Some of the dominant technology firms in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to. Some of the biggest California companies and stocks have also been previously discussed.The tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is headquartered in Cupertino, California. Recently, the company made a development in the laptop space and launched a new and  more powerful MacBook Air. On March 4, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that the new 13- and 15‑inch MacBook Air will be available beginning March 8. Using the powerful M3 chip, the MacBook Air tends to be up to 60% faster than the model having an M1 chip. It also ranks as the world’s best consumer laptop for AI while allowing up to 18 hours of battery life. Based on the improved performance and features, the 13-inch model serves as the bestselling laptop globally while the 15-inch model is the bestselling 15-inch laptop around the world.The Palo Alto-based HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) offers more than 100 AI-enabled solutions under its artificial intelligence portfolio. On March 7, the company unveiled the industry’s largest portfolio of AI PCs. This includes HP Elite PCs which serve as the leading business laptops for collaboration in the world, and Z by HP mobile workstations. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has also announced program enhancements for channel partners under which they will now be capable of accessing the first role-based AI partner training and certification program.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another California-based technology company that is enabling the penetration of generative AI, an emerging tech trend. On March 7, the company reported the introduction of a new professional certification in generative AI. Developers and professionals can polish their proficiency in AI through this professional certification program from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which encompasses two associate-level generative AI certifications. The certification will focus on large language models and multimodal workflow skills. You can also take a look at the fastest-growing technology companies in the US.Now that we have navigated through the population dynamics in the US, depopulating cities and their business potential, we can move to the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most.15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the MostOur Methodology:In order to compile a list of the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most, we sourced data from the US Census Bureau.

2024-03-16 14:15:00+00:00,"This Warren Buffett ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Is Riskier Than You Think","Many of you are aware of Warren Buffett's legendary investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). He and his lieutenants started buying shares in 2016 and 2017 for Berkshire Hathaway, making it the largest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio. Today, the stake is worth an estimated $175 billion. Shares are up over 500% since the beginning of 2017, making the Apple investment one of Buffett's best purchases ever.But just because Apple has done well in the past does not mean it will do well in the future. There are looming risks with this ""Magnificent Seven"" favorite that I believe are underappreciated by investors right now. Here's why Apple stock remains risky for investors to own in 2024.The first concern with Apple is broad-based: Revenue is stagnating. Despite high inflation around the world in the last few years, Apple's revenue on a trailing-12-month basis is actually down from the middle of 2022. Adjusted for inflation, this means that Apple's sales have taken quite a hit in the last few years.The only hardware segment that grew sales in fiscal Q1 2024 was the iPhone, hitting $70 billion in revenue for the holiday quarter compared to $66 billion a year prior. This business should remain solid for Apple if it can continue to raise prices, but unit sales for smartphones have stagnated for years. The days of hyper-growth for the iPhone are likely over.So how can Apple increase its revenue? Setting aside its burgeoning services segment, Apple needs to find another hardware device that can drive sales. It certainly won't be the iPad, Watch, or Mac segments, which serve as either niche or adjacent products to the iPhone. But what about the Vision Pro mixed reality headset? It launched earlier this year and sports a $3,500 price tag. If Apple can start selling a lot of Vision Pros, this could drive growth over the next decade.The problem is that the Vision Pro looks like a flop. A lot of buyers are returning their devices, with many saying they have stopped using it regularly. Time will tell, but so far it looks like the Vision Pro is far from the next iPhone. To drive sales growth for a company like Apple, the Vision Pro will have to become a global hit. That has not happened with its first iteration and is likely many years away from happening, if it ever does.Stagnant revenue isn't the only concern for Apple. There are major looming risks from government regulations that could eliminate some of its historical cash cows.First, the Chinese government is increasing its oversight and regulations against Apple products. It is widening the iPhone ban across governmental agencies as the East Asian giant expands its conflict with Apple's home country, the United States. Last quarter, 17.4% of Apple's sales came from China. If this goes away, it would be a major hit to Apple's income statement.Some investors might argue that Apple's services segment will drive growth. It has in the past and is now a much larger part of the business. Last fiscal year, services brought in $85 billion in high-margin revenue from things like Apple Music, the App Store, and AppleTV+. The issue is that governments are attacking Apple's App Store and distribution payments from Google.We are seeing increasing regulatory attention focused on the App Store. The E.U. just fined Apple around $2 billion solely for being anticompetitive in the music streaming business. Multiple governments are debating whether to pass regulation against the App Store and its 30% take rate on digital transactions, which generates a ton of high-margin revenue for Apple each year.Perhaps more important is Apple's distribution payment that it receives from Google Search each year. It is estimated that the search giant pays Apple upwards of $20 billion just to be the default search engine on Apple devices. This is basically pure profit and would make up a large chunk of the Mac maker's $118 billion in annual operating earnings. The courts in the United States are debating whether this payment from Google is anticompetitive. If they decide it is, $20 billion in annual earnings could be immediately wiped away from Apple's income statement.If we look at Apple's stock price, it shows that the company's valuation is not very attractive for a low-growth operation. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 27, which is right around the market average but still sits at a premium to faster-growing companies like Alphabet, the parent of Google Search.And these trailing earnings do not take into account any future headwinds from China, a Vision Pro flop, or the potential steep reduction in high-margin services revenue. Add everything together, and Apple may be the riskiest Magnificent Seven stock to own in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-16 13:03:00+00:00,Companies Paid a Record $1.7 Trillion in Dividends Last Year. These 3 Dividend Stocks Led the Way.,"According to a report by Janus Henderson Global, companies paid a staggering $1.7 trillion in dividends to their shareholders in 2023. That was a record amount of cash payments, 5% above 2022's total. Hundreds of companies helped drive the corporate sector's record dividend outlay. However, three rose to the top as the biggest payers: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). Here's a look at what they paid investors last year and whether these leading dividend stocks can continue enriching their investors through dividends. Microsoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, which was the most of any company. The technology titan is routinely one of the top dividend-paying stocks. It was the leader in 2020, placed second in 2021, and was third in 2022. It was able to reclaim its spot at the top by increasing its dividend (it boosted its dividend per share by 10% in each of the last two years). Meanwhile, the leader of the last two years, mining giant BHP Group, has paid less in dividends due to lower commodity prices. Microsoft can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the last six months, Microsoft has produced nearly $50 billion in net cash flow from operations while paying $10.6 billion in dividends. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74 billion in debt. That strong financial profile helps support its elite AAA credit rating. The technology company is also investing heavily in its growth, including acquiring gaming company Activision and developing AI technology with OpenAI. These and other catalysts should enable Microsoft to grow its cash flow, giving it even more money to pay dividends.Fellow tech giant Apple clocked in at No. 2, paying $14.9 billion in dividends last year. That was slightly more than it paid in 2022, thanks to dividend increases. Apple raised its per-share payment by 4.3% last year, following a 4.5% bump in 2022. Like Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its big-time payout. The technology giant produced $110.5 billion in cash from operating activities during 2023. It also boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. Apple ended the year with a jaw-dropping $162 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $111 billion of debt. That also allows the company to invest heavily in research and development to launch innovative products that drive revenue and cash-flow growth. It recently launched its Vision Pro VR headset and is starting to invest more heavily in generative AI. These growth drivers should enable Apple to produce more cash that it could use to pay dividends in the future.ExxonMobil was right behind Apple at around $14.9 billion in dividend payments last year. The oil giant has steadily increased its dividend. It raised its payment by 4.1% late last year, its 41st straight year of dividend growth. It also grew its payout by 3.4% in late 2022. The energy company produced a prodigious amount of cash last year despite lower oil and gas prices. Free cash flow actually increased by $1.9 billion last year to $36.1 billion, thanks to its focus on investing in high-margin capital projects. While ExxonMobil returned an industry-leading $32.4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, it still grew its cash balance to $31.6 billion. ExxonMobil's high-return investment strategy has it on track to double its earnings potential by 2027. On top of that, the company agreed to buy rival Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal worth more than $60 billion, which will further enhance its ability to grow its free cash flow. These and other catalysts should give ExxonMobil more than enough fuel to continue growing its monster dividend. Microsoft, Apple, and ExxonMobil led the world in dividend payments last year. The massive companies produce enormous cash flows, giving them the money to invest in growing their businesses, pay ever-increasing dividends, and maintain cash-rich balance sheets. Those features make them ideal stocks for those seeking very safe and steadily rising dividends.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-16 12:30:00+00:00,Qualcomm's Powerful PC Chip Is Worse for AMD Than for Intel,"In the world of PC CPUs, the x86 architecture reigns supreme. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are the only two companies outside of China able to design x86 processors destined for PCs.There have been efforts to break the x86 stranglehold, but until recently, they've fallen short. A version of the Windows 8 operating system ran on Arm-based chips, and Microsoft even released variants of its Surface tablet about a decade ago powered by them.The big problem was compatibility. Applications compiled for standard x86 Windows wouldn't work. This created confusion among consumers expecting to be able to download whatever applications they wanted. The product and Arm-based Windows were mostly dead on arrival.Apple is the only success story so far, thanks to its complete control over hardware and software for its Mac PCs. The company began switching from Intel CPUs to custom Arm-based CPUs in 2020, providing a translation layer called Rosetta that enabled old applications compiled for Intel-based Macs to run on new Arm-based Macs. The switch has given Apple an important edge over Windows laptops in terms of battery life.For Microsoft, keeping Apple in check requires PCs to get better, particularly on the efficiency and battery-life fronts. While Intel made progress with its Meteor Lake chips launched late last year, more competition is likely necessary to push Windows PCs forward.Microsoft has been once again trying to push an Arm-based version of Windows, this time with Windows 11 and a translation layer that enables traditional Windows applications to run. There are some laptops already available running Arm-based chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), although they fall short in terms of performance. There are still some compatibility issues, and emulating x86 apps introduces a performance penalty that noticeably slows things down.Microsoft and Qualcomm aren't giving up. Qualcomm's next-generation PC CPU, the Snapdragon X Elite, may be powerful enough to overcome the performance gap with traditional laptops when it starts showing up in devices in mid-2024. There are even rumors circulating that Microsoft will announce a new Surface laptop later this month packing one of Qualcomm's new chips.In early pre-release testing, the Snapdragon X Elite has put up some impressive results. Tom's Hardware recently reported that some benchmarks taken at an official Qualcomm event during the Mobile World Congress paint a rosy picture for the upcoming Arm-based chip. Up against Intel's Core 7 Ultra 155H, the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite held its own in some tests, while beating the Intel chip by wide margins in others.While it will take time for Arm-based laptops to win over consumers, it seems inevitable that the PC CPU duopoly's days are numbered. More competition is bad news for both Intel's and AMD's PC CPU businesses.However, Intel has a way to benefit from Arm-based PC chips proliferating, while AMD does not. Intel may lose PC CPU market share, but its foundry business could eventually be pumping out Arm-based PC chips for Qualcomm and others.Intel expects to surpass semiconductor foundry leader TSMC technologically early next year with its Intel 18A process, which packs a new transistor design and will be the first process node to use backside-power delivery, which can boost power efficiency. This will be particularly important for chips aiming to maximize battery life.Intel and Arm Holdings struck a deal last year to co-optimize the Arm architecture and the Intel 18A process. Intel has scored some Arm-based design wins -- notably, a server chip using Arm Neoverse cores. If Arm-based PCs take off, the downside of potentially losing share in the PC CPU market can be offset by design wins in the foundry business.AMD doesn't manufacture its own chips, so increased competition in the PC CPU market is all downside. The company is already in a distant second place in the PC CPU market with a unit share of about 20%. Viable Arm-based PCs powered by CPUs from Qualcomm and potentially others -- Nvidia is rumored to be working on PC chips -- will eat away at that market share.One could argue that Intel has more to lose, given that its PC CPU market share is much higher. That may be true, but it also has more to gain. As Intel pushes to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030, Arm-based PC chips are likely to roll off the company's assembly lines as its manufacturing technology catches up with TSMC.While Arm-based PCs introduce uncertainty for both Intel and AMD, they represent an opportunity for Intel, while only a risk for AMD.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-16 11:00:00+00:00,Can Nvidia Become the World's Largest Company?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a candidate to overtake Microsoft and Apple as the largest company in the world. After starting 2023 being valued at around a $350 billion market cap, Nvidia is now worth about $2.2 trillion.That's a dramatic expansion in value and it puts it within striking distance of Microsoft and Apple, which are valued at around $3.1 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur.Nvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia. When AI demand started to take off during Nvidia's second quarter of 2023 (ending July 30, 2023), that's when its growth really started.In the last three quarters, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled compared to the previous year's results. For the current quarter, which is first quarter of fiscal year 2025, that trend is also expected to continue as management projects $24 billion in revenue -- a 234% projected increase.After Q1, Nvidia will have harder comparisons. However, if it can maintain its revenue levels in the mid-$20 billion range, it will still post strong growth, as Q2 and Q3 of FY 2024 saw $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion in revenue, respectively.But will that be enough to surpass Apple and Microsoft?If Nvidia can achieve its projection of $24 billion in revenue in Q1 and barely grow quarter over quarter throughout the year to attain $100 billion in revenue for FY 2025, that could set Nvidia up nicely.Using its Q4 profit margin of 55% as a baseline, Nvidia would produce $55 billion in profits. But how does that compare to Microsoft and Apple?The chart below shows the trailing 12-month (TTM) total of each company's net income. So, even if Nvidia achieves $55 billion in annual profit, it would still be far behind Microsoft and Apple.For Nvidia to surpass either company, investors would have to place a significant premium on the stock, reflected in an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Nvidia's P/E ratio is already much higher than that of Microsoft or Apple, as it trades for 77 times earnings versus Microsoft's 38 and Apple's 27.If Nvidia kept its 77 times earnings price tag with $55 billion in profit, it would be valued at $4.24 trillion, easily surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But that isn't likely.Nvidia's stock is valued at a premium because investors know that this figure will come down as it grows into its newfound business. So, the only way Nvidia will maintain its 77 times earnings premium at the end of this fiscal year is if it continues doubling or tripling its revenue each quarter.If Nvidia does that, it will have earned the title of the world's largest company. This seems a far stretch, considering that many GPU orders have already been placed.Will Nvidia overtake Microsoft or Apple in valuation? I'd say it's unlikely. But Nvidia has produced uncommon growth for the last three quarters, and if that trend continues over the next year, it has a shot at capturing the title of the world's largest company.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Please note that our earnings release is available on the Investor Relations page of this EDGE website. The earnings release has also been filed on Form 8-K with the SEC. I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.Jonathan ReichGood morning. Thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin by briefly reviewing our second quarter results, demonstrating how our fiscal year 2023 investments have positioned us for sustainable long-term growth. Q2 revenue increased 11% from last year as we continued managing the geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry specific challenges spanning the landscape. One of the big stories this past quarter was continued momentum at the Zedge marketplace. Ad revenue was up 18% from last year. Zedge plus our marketplace subscription offering delivered exciting results with revenue increasing 24% from last year with small net subscriber gains sequentially and less than 1% net subscriber loss year over year. And Zedge Premium revenue driven by several improvements to content monetization and other back-end front-end items was up 21%. These factors fueled a 37% increase in the average revenue per monthly active user or RPU. Now to a record $0.072, and this strength was not just on Android as IOS revenue for the Zedge marketplace was up an impressive 46% sequentially. I should add that many of these trends are holding up at the halfway point of our fiscal third quarter. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we said building a full-stack marketing team would be our key corporate-wide initiative similar to what we accomplished with data analytics in fiscal 2023. We're well on our way here, and our efforts are starting to bear fruit especially for the Zevex marketplace. Another important story this quarter relates to maturing our product development organization to drive innovation to accelerate product diversification and consolidate resources to ensure long-term success to that end, we have assembled an all-star team of seasoned gaming experts who are alumni of the leading mobile gaming publishers and have turned them loose on shots. Their mandate is to unleash the growth that was core to our investment thesis at the time of the acquisition. This team is already sprinting having overhauled the product roadmap with four major focus areas. The first is teacher development, which hasn't been given the attention it deserves since the acquisition in the past, successful new features would yield a 10% to 30% jump in revenues with little or no downside when they didn't take hold. The updated product roadmap is full of new features designed to drive revenue and make guru shots more accessible to an even broader audience. Next, our decision to focus on innovation will allow us to drive user growth by investing our marketing dollars more efficiently. Specifically, we will better a couple grew chasses UA spend with feature releases. In January, we introduced turbo feature that expands the gameplay and improves game resource consumption. To date, it has yielded a 15% increase in average daily revenue, giving me confidence that we are on the right track. Traditionally, we are about to release another new feature flash challenges, a short duration photo challenge that limits the number of participants per challenge and provides even more opportunities for users to win. We believe that this dynamic will drive up engagement to make food shops more accessible to a broader set of players, both existing and new. In parallel, the team is reinventing the game economy by converting to a coin based economy supporting multiple currencies and foregoing the existing autonomy, which we believe is too rigid and limited in terms of the number of ways players can earn and spend in-game resources. This change will open an array of customer value ads. For example, we will be able to reward all players with game currency and manage resource consumption in a fashion that optimizes further coin purchases, creating a comprehensive and inviting on-boarding funnel is also a key focus area for the grooming shops, game insured onboarding will enable newbies to immediately experience gameplay in a simplified manner with a limited number of competitors increasing their chances of winning the funnel will allow players to progress with more features and increased complexity based on individual performance, enabling skill-based user segmentation, which will be a win for the user base. I want to add that we believe these efforts taken in concert with one another will help us deliver growth, which was one of the key theses of the acquisition through shots is the leading photo competition game and more than 150 million photos have been used to play. The game photography continues growing exponentially due to the ubiquity of mobile phones and with the advent of AI enhancements, high quality pictures are within everyone's reach. The gameplay is fine and it touches on the human interface. Safety for people like to have fun, compete and win with all the opportunities we have in the pipeline. I think we are at a turning point and I look forward to sharing details as they unfold. Moving to the Zedge marketplace our success in growing advertising revenue in recent quarters stems from our continuous optimization efforts, combined with highly effective paid UA programs are driving positive roll offs in 90 days or less Additionally, over the past two quarters, we began improving our IOS monetization stack by optimizing ads and rolling out Zedge plus for IOS, which, along with paint contributed to strong iOS revenue growth. Overall, the iOS ecosystem remains a largely untapped opportunity for us, and we continuously look at ways most recently AI to unlock it and capitalize on our brand to drive growth motor PTO had another good quarter. Our previous investments in website redesign, localization and technology upgrades continued to pay off and lay the foundation for the next phase of growth with new features and content expected to be rolled out in the quarters to come. Taken together, we continue to believe that we have never been in a better position to create sustainable long-term profitable growth given the combination of market opportunity, our current product portfolio and roadmap, our marketing prowess, data capabilities, tech stack, and most importantly, our team. Furthermore, we are not just talking about AI. We have already integrated it throughout our business, including product technology and marketing. And now I would like to turn the call over to Yi, who will review our financial results. Yi?Yi TsaiYes. Thank you, Jonathan. As you saw in our earnings release, GAAP requires us to take a one-time $11.9 million non-cash write-down of goodwill charges, intangible asset. It's important to underscore that this was a non-cash event dictated by time as current performance demand line with a carrying value in the loan book. As Jonathan indicated, we still believe that with time, we will unlock growth and achieve the strategic goals that we envisioned when we acquire closure. Additionally, this write-down does not reflect the valuable gamification experience we secure benefiting the rest of our business as a result of the strain related to variation. Over the past year, we have added non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as new metrics that we plan to report going forward. The reconciliation for GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our earnings release from this morning. Monthly active users on now for the debt marketplace decreased 10.7% from a year ago to $28.8 million. Now in well developed market and emerging market were down 15.6% and 9.2%, respectively. Total revenue in the second quarter was $7.8 million, up 11% from last year due to the goods and services, which encompasses revenue from Korea, came in at $0.9 million, down 26% from last year. Similar to Q1, GuruShots revenue was again negatively impacted by Apple's ATT framework, macro economic issues and the geopolitical situations. Subscription revenue for the second quarter was up 24% versus last year. Additionally, this metric was up sequentially for the third straight quarter as our net active subscriber trend improved and higher-value IOS attrition and our new value add exist Plus offering for Android replace lower cost legacy subscription, which only remove it net premiums. Gross transaction value or GTV, grew 23% from last year to a record $540,000, reflecting higher price per advertising impression and incremental revenue generated from payments, which offset modest decline in other content sales. It was a record [$0.072], up 37% year over year, reflecting stability in our pricing and a positive impact of our new IOS Android. Subscription cost of revenue declined by 27% and was 5.9% of revenue. SG&A increased by 11% to $6.5 million. GAAP loss from operation, including the impact of the $11.9 million write off was $11.9 million versus income from operation of $1.5 million last year. GAAP net loss and loss per share for Q2 was $9.2 million or $0.66 versus income and EPS of $1.6 million and $0.11, respectively in a prior year. Non-gaap net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.5 million and $0.04 versus $0.8 million and $0.06 in the prior year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million versus $1.4 million in the prior year. From a liquidity standpoint, we remain in a strong cash position with over $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, not every pay down the $2 million in outstanding bank loan during the quarter. Thank you for listening to our second quarter earnings call. And I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in mid June. Operator, back to you for Q&A.Operator(Operator Instructions) Allen Klee, Maxim Group.Allen KleeCongratulations on the strong revenue growth from my first question is you had record advertising rates, but it's also your seasonally strongest quarter, I think.

And as I mentioned in my earlier summary of the quarter, we're actually seeing that our comm halfway through the quarter numbers are holding up. So that is due to a combination of factors, both speaker wise as tech winds or ad stack was high as well as I guess, some secular features or some such secular factors. So it's a little bit hard to sort of parse that out because by contrast typically our Q3 is our weakest quarter from an ad revenue perspective in light of post season drop-off in ad budgets and so on and so forth.Allen KleeThat's great. Thank you. And then just, in terms of the marketplace, I think you said that paint and there's greater functionality on the web and gross transactional value sold was up like 23%. Is there a way to think about what the key drivers are of them have growth in marketplace and things that you're doing keep us going?Brian SiegelSure. Just to be more specific, are you talking about Zedge Premium? Are you talking about the overall marketplace, which includes not only licensed content but also user-generated content?Allen KleeFor both.Brian SiegelWell, right. When you take a look at Zedge Premium, which is the licensed content area. We continue to iterate Teun Optimiz. And as a result, you're seeing the improvements there. We are also and now beginning to think about what can that market, what converged premium look like with the expansion across web and in terms of the overall Zedge app are global in that marketplace it's a function of continually adding and optimizing features that we have as well as improving the user experience. There's work that can be done on the user experience. One of the areas that we're beginning to look into now relates to us onboarding. In the past, we've talked about our recommendations on the content that served up to users. How does that impact on the user experience and then projects around improving engagement and retention. So in our totality, each of those contributes up to the results that we reported today and then separate and apart from that, as I mentioned, the work that we had done last year in terms of overhauling the Zedge plus subscription on Android and rolling out Z plus subscription on IOS for the first time, it has also yielded very positive results for us.Allen Klee(multiple speakers) Yes. Thank you, Al. Just so we understand, is it Zedge plus is Zedge marketplace subscription and you also get another different type of subscription just for being ad free for, are they the same and then your paid subscribers were flat sequentially do you think that that number can can continue to grow sequentially? Thank you.Brian SiegelSo that plus is our subscription offering. Our subscription offering has a bundle together. Several value adds up one of those value adds, is it free as you described it, but then if there are additional value adds in there, whether it be both that can be used for creating a I images ahm as an example. And insofar as a potential growth of number of subscribers, our aspiration is clearly to see to it that that subscription number grows over time and there is ongoing work with respect to how to make that subscription offering, whether it be on Android or on IOS even more attractive. If I were to provide a metaphor when you think about Amazon. So Amazon has overnight delivery, but they also offer a wealth of other value ads, whether it be content, whether it be storage and so on. And so forth. And as I said, as a metaphor, that is the work that we are heavily invested in terms of saying to us that we can continue to make the subscription offering even more attractive than what exists today. And going back to the overhaul that we had introduced in 2023, that was a lot of improvements in terms of those value adds, making that subscription offering more attractive and ultimately bringing in new subscribers.Yi TsaiThank you. In terms of a major TV, I don't know if you've provided any numbers in terms of did it grow over year over year as a result, I'm not sure if you're able to provide revenue also, you said the new actions you'd like to add mentioned some things like emoji mash-ups, emotive times, and I'm probably saying around KO. emojis.Brian SiegelCould you just tell me what mash-ups and payer markets are saying, I'm sure these are new content just to keep it simple, these are new content forms. But by way of example, on when today, one renders a smiley emoji and they can either have a smiley face in yellow and so on and so forth or they can type of coal and a closed frenzy. That is a contrast with the text strings that connote a various messages are, and that is a potential direction for us to add as a new content vertical within a motor PDR. And that's one of many in terms of numbers, I'm going to hand off to you to answer your question, Alan.Yi TsaiSo he moved to PDR. The second quarter call was not as great as we had hoped for. But if you look at the six months, we still grew that 27%. For three months ended January, we only grew about 8%.Allen KleeThank you. And then one of the areas that I think you mentioned as a priority is on monthly trying to grow monthly active users that was up slightly sequentially, which which is encouraging. Pat, could you maybe just highlight some of the key things you're focused on to get that number to start growing again?Brian SiegelSure. So we have a couple of activities that are taking place. We put together what I'll call a task force of rank and file their complaints with out a management participation that are working on some various feature enhancements, new features and potentially complementary products that would unlock growth. And then separately, we are also looking at ways of reimagining are they Zedge app or benefiting from the installed base that we have got to help fuel additional growth, whether that be through product marketing, incentive plans, influencer type of job of end referral plans. And then, of course, separate and apart from that on user acquisition investments and all of those taken together, we we are hoping that we can reverse that trend and see to it that we unlock what we believe to be on a promising growth opportunities on an annual escalator at.Yi TsaiSo I would just like to, as we mentioned, even though our active subscribers stayed flat at 648,000, but we are replacing low value solution with a higher value from the lifetime subscription as well as suppressing. So although the active subscribers remain the same, but our revenue base, what's much higher?Brian SiegelThank you.Allen KleeA yes, that's a good point. Thank you. Then on through Charles City, a couple of questions. My personal experience, and I'm a bad example, not being that savvy in this stuff, but on it's hard to be a newbie to when you first get on, it seems difficult to know how to engage, you know, and it tells you, you know, you can engage in a bunch of things until you get to a certain level. So maybe what you're doing to change that. And then also talk a little about what the the turbo feature, what that actually is and the new feature you're going to add and then why multiple virtual currencies some should help you out. Thanks.Brian SiegelThank you, Allen. And a point very well taken with respect to onboarding, as you said, a newbie that downloads good shots today, it is immediately immerse in the full game as they enter into a competition, they can be competing against up to 7,000 other photographers that are in that our competition with a dashboard that has a lot of numbers and features to it. So a user has to be exceptionally loyal and very, very insistent on saying they're going to figure this thing out. Our overhauling onboarding will allow for us too simplify the game plan such that we get users into that funnel immediately, which opens up the top of the funnel, hopefully expand for plate, the potential player base and also allows for folks that may think that they are not good photographers, making this accessible to them. And then with progression as users begin to master skills and so on and so forth, they will then gain again, exposure to additional features. Our that contribute to making in-play more competitive and fun and so on and so forth. In addition to that, the onboarding will on have an element to it to that makes the game more or I guess, shorter in duration. So a typical photo challenge today, Inder shops can range in duration from one to several days. The notion of going through that onboarding feature will be to decrease that to you know, it could be 30 minutes. It could be an hour or it could be two hours and so on and so forth with respect to our changing the economy. The economy today is a rigid economy. There are three game resources that users can benefit from while playing the game and the way to access those game resources is through a hard in-app purchase event. If you buy resource A., it does not have any relevance to resource BOC to master the game. You really need to have a portfolio of those three resources and migrating to a coin based on economy, which has multiple currencies allows for a lot more flexibility. And it also allows for us to some reward every player in the game. Meaning if you are playing a game today and you don't come in first, second or third place, that means you don't feel that great about yourself, even though you may have come in for which is 6,996 in terms of your ranking, our ability will be with this new our Coinbase economy proceeded with the every player, even a player that ranks lowest of those 7,000, we'll be able to get a reward and ultimately use that reward in one way, shape form or another or use those rewards in order to potentially gain an edge. With respect to game resources, as I mentioned during my comments, we've made changes to the product team and the product team is now very, very well resourced with a community of product managers that come out of some of the most well-known global gaming companies that have experienced not only in a gaming design, user experience, user interface, but also in gaming economies and what can be done in order to optimize those economies, ultimately leading to better revenue generation as well as contributing to improving user engagement and user retention in totality. Our hope and expectation is that taken together that will unlock the growth that we believe is inherent in this asset in terms of content, the new features, the new features most immediately are around offering what I will call mini game battles for users that are already in the middle of the game and then and now beginning to expand that too, and just being a standalone short term, limited number of competitors type of battle. Again, allowing for this to be a quick win for users to get that dopamine flow and feel like, wow, they're competing in real time without having to wait for an extended period of time in order to ultimately win a battle. And in addition to that, also decreasing the number of people that they're competing against, therefore increasing the chances that they can actually win. And again, that escalated accordingly. Does that answer your question?Allen KleeNo, that was very thorough. Thank you. From just some updates on AI. heart Master, can you provide an update on that?Brian SiegelSure. So a master remains in soft launch. So we made the decision to keep it in soft launch. While we are hard at work at unlocking the growth in the core guru shots game and we continue to gather data. Our plan currently is that when we get to crew change its trajectory and the direction and that we believe will allow for this growth that we will then refocus efforts and resources on AIR. master. We just don't want to spread ourselves so thinly that were not progressing the GURU shouts game and that as we evolve, it will take time to watch this AR master game as we iterate and so on and so forth. So focusing on getting one thing gone really, really well and then progressing to the next thing, which would be a our master or master now is at a point where we are able to monitor the data. That data is going to be exceptionally valuable in terms of helping guide what our future direction is with that game and how it evolves.Allen KleeGot you. Okay. And then probably I'm guessing a similar answer answer from the past call, you talked about potentially launching hybrid casual game. Is that kind of in the same status or --Brian SiegelAI. art Master is in that hybrid casual category those those are not separate and distinct from one another.Allen KleeOkay, got it. Thank you on. Okay. And then, um, question on financials. The jump in SG&A for the quarter is the ways I look at that. To what degree do we think of that as like on finance that this is a seasonally strong quarter versus some of the other things you talked about perhaps a good acquisition or some of the new well, it's ISG. and you brought on some more people. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of it is maybe seasonal versus revenue run rate for SG&A?Brian SiegelI would actually reframe that a little bit. SG&A includes marketing. So there are two components of that number one is actual money that we have spent on paid user acquisition, as I've said in the past, in order to scale paid user acquisition, when looking at budgets, there is going to be steady state on this platform. This particular campaign works. We continue investing in it, but there is obviously a ceiling there. And then there is what we'll call test budgets for you trying new platform, you're trying new creatives and stuff like that and some of that stuff works. Some of that does not need both components in order to scale pay user acquisition. But then there is also the fee that we pay to, whether it be Apple or Google when we bring on a subscriber or when a user makes an in-app purchase. So those two components taken together contributed materially to the increase in SG&A. And the way I sort of look at it is if we're successful in growing our subscriber base. If we're successful in generating more in-app purchases, SG&A goes up, that's actually a good reason for SG&A to go up as opposed to. We're not managing our expense for infrastructure properly minute By way of contrast, EVM, anything that you want to add to that.Yi TsaiBut yes, I'll only add a pattern of FT. remain quite stable in all net compensation expenses to be in line with last year. So all the increase in exiting a Jonathan mentioned is in the marketing spend and also the pipeline we see one of the downside than we were a lifetime subscription runs from Google Play's point of view, it's just one and done. So they traded at a in their purchase just so we pay a 30% fee rather than a vigorous appreciating, which is at 15% fee. So as a result on our platform fee went up by virtue of our rolling out a lifetime subscription?Allen KleeGreat. Okay. Congrats again and thank you so much.Brian SiegelThank you.OperatorThis does conclude our question and answer session and the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

2024-03-15 21:26:05+00:00,Ex-Apple exec Pete Distad named CEO of sports streaming venture,"Disney's ESPN (DIS), Fox (FOX, FOXA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) have joined forces to launch a joint sports venture streaming service. On Friday, the companies announced Pete Distad, a former Apple (AAPL) and Hulu executive, would serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the upcoming service.The highly anticipated streaming service is slated for launch in the fall, with Wall Street analysts estimating that the service could have a subscription fee ranging between $40 and $50 per month.Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal breaks down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: The new sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Fox has found its CEO. It's former Apple and Hulu executive. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. She's been following this for more.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So now we have a little bit more context, a little bit more information when it comes to this skinny bundle between ESPN, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Fox. Like you said, Julie, Pete Distad is going to be the new CEO. He's a former executive at-- at both Hulu and Apple. So he has that connection with Disney, which I think is important because he's going to be working across three different companies. So the fact that he's already been at one of those three, I think, is important.Now he was at Apple for a decade. Prior to that, he was at Hulu for six years. But while he was at Apple, he was responsible for the business operations and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts. That included the launch of Apple TV in 2015, the eventual-- eventual launch of the streaming service Apple TV+, and then that $2.5 billion acquisition of MLS Season Pass in 2022.So he has the sports and streaming experience that these three companies had really been looking for. This is a service that's going to launch in the fall. We don't know the price point, but Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said that he expects it to be on the higher end of estimates. Wall Street is estimating between 40 to 50 bucks a month. So expect to pay around that $50 range. He also said that he is-- he expects subscribers to hit around 5 million in five years. So by the year 2029. Just put that number in perspective.YouTube TV, which probably is going to be a pretty big competitor, that has more than 8 million subscribers. And that launched in 2017. So we'll see they're targeting the cord cutters, the cord nevers. I think a big question mark is going to come down to price and how much people are willing to pay for this type of service. Let's find out.JOSH LIPTON: Right now, Alex, it's like 40 to 50 you're hearing out there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's the range. And he did say the higher range of estimates. So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw something between 50 to 55 bucks a month, which is a lot of money. But if you're a big sports fan--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think those people like to pay.JOSH LIPTON: We'll see how big that audience is. That's the money. Thank you, Alex.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/ex-apple-exec-pete-distad-212605120.html

2024-03-15 19:59:24+00:00,Norfolk County Council secures settlement as Apple agrees £384m lawsuit payment,"Norfolk County Council has secured a settlement in a lawsuit against Apple, with the tech giant agreeing to pay 490 million dollars (£384 million) in a “tremendous result”.The lawsuit alleged Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook misled investors about iPhone sales in China between November 2018 and January the following year.The preliminary settlement filed in the US District Court in Oakland, northern California, will need final approval from a judge at a further hearing.The class action – made on behalf of a group of claimants including investors in Apple – was led by Norfolk Council, which said its pension fund was affected by the company’s alleged actions.A spokesperson for the Norfolk Pension Fund said: “We are proud of this recovery for investors.“We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals.“When and where it’s warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants’ investments are harmed by fraud.”The Oakland court’s judgment said: “The settlement is a tremendous result for the class.”According to the document, Norfolk Council became the “lead plaintiff” in June 2020 and alleged that Apple “made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about demand for the newly-released iPhones and Apple’s business in China” contrary to the Securities Exchange Act 1934.The complaint further alleged “false and misleading statements and omissions” caused Apple’s stock to trade at “artificially inflated prices” before the stock price declined when the “true facts” were disclosed.Mr Cook indicated during an investor conference call in November 2018 that iPhone sales in China were performing well, according to the complaint.In January the following year, the chief executive warned Apple’s revenue for the quarter would drop nine billion dollars (£7.09 billion) below what was predicted – with almost all of the fall found to be down to poor demand in China.It led to the company’s stock price diving 10% in the next day of frenetic trading and cut shareholder wealth by more than 70 billion dollars (£55 billion).Apple denied Mr Cook deceived investors about the phone’s sales in China in that period.“Defendants (Apple) have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this action,” the Oakland judgment made clear.“But in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive and distracting have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action.”The parties accepted a mediator’s proposal to settle on March 1.Norfolk Council will receive a portion of the settlement.Apple recorded 97 billion dollars (£76 billion) in profit in its last fiscal year. The 490 million-dollar payment is less than 1% of that figure.Apple has been approached for comment.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/norfolk-county-council-secures-settlement-195924538.html
2024-03-15 18:44:28+00:00,Apple acquires AI startup specializing in overseeing manufacturing components,"Apple has added another AI startup to its acquisition list with Canada-based DarwinAI, which specializes in vision-based tech to observe components during manufacturing to improve efficiency, Bloomberg reported.While Apple and DarwinAI haven't announced this deal, several members of the startup's team joined Apple's machine learning teams in January, as per their LinkedIn profiles.DarwinAI had raised over $15 million in funding across various rounds from investors, including BDC Capital’s Deep Tech Venture Fund, Honeywell Ventures, Obvious Ventures and Inovia Capital. BDC Capital confirms on its website that it has received an exit from DarwinAI, whereas Obvious Ventures has updated its portfolio to reflect that the startup has been acquired.BDC Capital and Obvious Ventures didn't comment on the story at the time of writing. We have reached out to Apple for a comment, and we will update the story if we get a response.As Bloomberg noted in its report, apart from helping with manufacturing efficiency, DarwinAI uses techniques to make AI models smaller and faster. This could be useful for on-device generative AI features Apple hopes to introduce in iOS 18 this year.Apple has lagged in releasing GenAI-powered features as compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta and Microsoft. In February, Tim Cook said the company plans to introduce such features ""later this year.""“We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Cook said during a quarterly earnings call with analysts.Last year the Apple CEO had confirmed investment into GenAI efforts. Apple's job listings have suggested the company is exploring infusing AI in multiple internal and external areas, including, Siri, developer tools and customer support.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-in-overlooking-manufacturing-components/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-040605041.html
2024-03-15 18:16:49+00:00,Apple to pay $490 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about iPhone sales in China,"Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in iPhone's sales in China that culminated in a jarring revision to the company's revenue forecast.The preliminary settlement filed Friday in Oakland, California, federal court stems from a shareholder lawsuit focused on the way Apple relayed information about how iPhone models released in September 2018 were performing in China, one of the company's biggest markets.Cook signaled that the new iPhones were off to a good start during an investor conference call in early November 2018, according to the complaint.That reassurance dissolved into a huge letdown on Jan. 2, 2019 when the Cook issued a warning that Apple's revenue for the just-completed quarter would fall $9 billion below management's forecast for the period. What's more, virtually all of the sales drop was traced to weak demand in China.It marked the first time Apple had cut its revenue guidance since the iPhone's release in 2007 and triggered its stock price to plunge 10% in the next day of frenetic trading, wiping out more than $70 billion in shareholder wealth.Apple vehemently denied Cook deceived investors about the iPhone's sales in China between early November and early January. The Cupertino, California, company maintained that stance in the settlement documents, but said it decided to make the payment after more than four years of legal wrangling to avoid an “overly burdensome, expensive, and distracting” hassle.The settlement was reached through a mediator after U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Apple's request to dismiss the case and set a Sept. 9 trial date.Gonzalez Rogers is now being asked to approve the settlement in a hearing scheduled for April 30.Thousands of shareholders who bought Apple stock in late 2018 could be eligible for a piece of the settlement, which will be distributed from of a pool that will be less than $490 million after lawyers involved in the case are paid. The attorneys plan to seek up to one-fourth, or about $122 million, of the settlement.The $490 million payment represents less than 1% of the $97 billion profit that Apple pocketed during its last fiscal year ended in September. Apple shareholders who have held on to their shares have become wealthier too. Apple's stock price has more than quadrupled from where it stood after Cook's China warning, creating an additional $2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-pay-490-million-settle-181649360.html
2024-03-15 18:06:56+00:00,Baby formula lawsuit wipes £7bn off FTSE 100 giant,"Consumer goods giant Reckitt has suffered a £7bn share price slump after it lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.London-listed Reckitt’s share price plunged by the most in two decades and to its lowest point in more than a decade after an Illinois jury ruled Reckitt had failed to warn about the risks of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) from its milk-based Enfamil brand products.NEC is an illness that damages the stomach and tends to affect premature babies. Reckitt’s US subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition had been sued by Jasmine Watson, who claimed the baby formula caused the death of her premature baby.FTSE 100-constituent Reckitt has now been ordered to pay Ms Watson $60m (£47m) after losing the case.Ashley Keller, a lawyer for Ms Watson, said: “The jury’s finding confirms what Mead Johnson folks already knew – that its formula dramatically increases the NEC risk   “This is the first verdict in the US, but won’t be the last, unless baby formula makers accept responsibility for their misdeeds.”News of the decision sparked a near 20pc plunge in Reckitt’s share price, wiping around £7.3bn ($9.3bn) from its market value.It comes amid hundreds of US lawsuits against formula makers over NEC. The Illinois case was the first to go to a jury trial.Shares in Abbott Laboratories, another formula maker facing legal claims, fell almost 5pc. Jurors took less than two hours to decide that Mead Johnson should pay $60m in compensatory damages. Mr Keller said: “We only asked for $25m, but the jury came back with more than double that.”More than 400 suits targeting Mead Johnson and Abbott are consolidated before a federal judge in Chicago for pre-trial information exchanges. The judge hasn’t yet scheduled a trial. Thousands of other suits are pending in state courts, Mr Keller said.   Reckitt continues to insist its products are safe and not linked to NEC. It has vowed to appeal the Illinois case.NEC has a fatality rate of as much as 40pc. It is a major cause of death among premature babies, though rarely occurs in full-term babies.The disease, which affects intestinal tissues, can be hard to diagnose. According to the NHS, symptoms can include general signs of illness, problems feeding or vomiting, and a swollen and tender abdomen.While it has a high fatality rate, it can be treated with intravenous feeding and antibiotics. In some cases it can require surgery.Reckitt said in a stock market update that it stands by the safety of its products and “strongly rejects any assertion that any of our products cause NEC”.The company added: “It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.“This case, and others like it, exclusively involve products used under the strict supervision of neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units and provide lifesaving nutrition options for vulnerable premature infants.“We are, of course, surprised and deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned.”Reckitt is one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, pulling in revenues of £14.6bn in 2023. As well as Enfamil, it makes products such as Durex condoms, Cillit Bang cleaning fluid and Gaviscon.Nutrition brands account for about 16pc of its sales, contributing £2.4bn to its turnover last year.News of the Illinois jury’s decision marks the latest in a series of blows for the company, which last month revealed a £55m hit to revenues caused by an accounting controversy in the Middle East.Kris Licht, chief executive at Reckitt, said the company had unearthed “some commercial practices that we weren’t particularly pleased with”, leading to the dismissal of a number of employees.Reckitt in January recalled two baby formula products from sale in the UK amid concerns they could contain dangerous bacteria, in an event unrelated to the case in the US.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us on the blog today.

Matt Oliver reports:The British engineering giant on Friday said it would increase its assembly, testing and shop capacity, to meet demand for its large engines and improve maintenance for those already in service.Over the rest of this decade, the company predicts the number of aircraft using its Trent family of turbofan engines to grow by as much as 9pc annually.As a result, Rolls is investing £55m and hiring 300 frontline workers to boost its operations in Derby and Dahlewitz, in Germany.About half of the investment and two thirds of the jobs will go to Derby, the company said.It will be used to expand the number of engines the company’s factory there can deliver per year by 40pc from 2025, while also increasing the number of engines that can undergo maintenance.Meanwhile, Rolls will take advantage of existing engine testing capabilities in Dahlewitz to temporarily meet extra maintenance demands before switching to assemble and test new Trent XWB-84 engines from 2026.It comes after the company vowed to invest £1bn in improvements to the Trent engine family.Last month Rolls revealed sales of its large aeroplane engines had surged to their highest level in 15 years.Major plans for gas-fired power stations that capture carbon took a key step forward today with the award of building contracts worth £4bn.The joint-venture scheme, led by British energy giant BP plus France’s TotalEnergies and Norway’s Equinor, forms part of the Government plans for a net zero carbon economy by 2050.The facilities, to be built in northern England by a date yet to be specified, come under the Net Zero Teesside Power and Northern Endurance Partnership banners.The pair on Friday said they had “selected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts with a combined value of around £4bn”. They added:The selection of nine leading specialist contractors ... is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK’s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.Up to two million tonnes of CO2 would be captured annually before being transported and securely stored in subsea sites beneath the North Sea.Companies awarded contracts included energy group Shell and infrastructure specialists Balfour Beatty.Friday’s announcement comes after Rishi Sunak’s administration this week pledged to build new gas-fired power stations to boost energy security.At the same time, the UK is rolling out low-carbon energies such as nuclear, solar and wind power in a strategy to combat sky-high domestic electricity and gas bills, which rocketed after key producer Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.Dettol maker Reckitt Benckiser has fallen 17pc this afternoon. It followed an Illinois jury ordering the company’s Mead Johnson division to pay $60m (£47m) to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company’s Enfamil baby formula.Shares plunged on fears that the consumer goods company would face more financial liabilities from lawsuits related to the baby formula.Reckitt told investors that it strongly disagreed with the jury’s decision.It said:We continue to believe that the allegations from the plaintiff’s lawyers in this case were not supported by the science or experts in the medical community … It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.Reckitt added that it was “deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned”.Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:It’s not simply the size of this payout which has caused nervousness, but the fact a long line of other lawsuits are pending, which could mount up to be a huge sum for the company.A Hong Kong-based activist investor has built up shares in Britain’s biggest sandwich maker after its share price fell by almost 50pc in the last five years. Daniel Woolfson reports:Oasis Management has acquired almost 5pc of the shares in Greencore, a major supplier of sandwiches and ready meals to the UK’s major supermarkets.Greencore produces 779m sandwiches a year and supplies Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.As well as sandwiches, it makes sushi, soups, packaged ready-meals and other chilled supermarket products. It employs around 13,600 people across the UK.Its shares have been languishing since the pandemic, falling more than 45pc over the last five years.Oasis has waged shareholder campaigns at a number of prominent consumer companies over recent years.A stake of almost 5pc of the company would make Oasis one of Greencore’s largest shareholders. It is understood that Oasis plans to continue buying shares. Once its stake rises above 5pc, it will be required to make a formal disclosure.Oasis’s European boss, Daniel Wosner, is understood to have met with executives at Greencore, the Financial Times, which first reported the news, said.Lenders to Thames Water’s parent company have reportedly hired advisers weeks before a £190m debt becomes due.Sky News says a syndicate of financiers have hired accountancy firm EY, amid concerns from regulators and politicians about the water company’s ability to survive.In December, Thames Water admitted to MPs that the holding company did not “currently” have the money to make the repayment due in April.Chris Weston, the newly appointed boss of Thames Water, has vowed to “restore confidence” in the business.He said:I recognise that this business is critical to both society and the UK and how important it is that we restore confidence in our operations and financial position.Thames Water declined to comment.Next is set to reveal higher profits for the past year as investors hope the clothing chain continues to shrug off customers’ cost-of-living pressures.The retailer has already upgraded its profit outlook five times over the past year as it has outperformed rivals amid a challenging economic backdrop.Shares in the company are trading at close to record highs as a result.The retailer is expected to reveal a 4pc increase in pre-tax profits to £905m for the year to January, in its latest update on Thursday next week.The group is also expected to reveal full-year sales growth of about 4pc against the previous year, taking sales to about £4.78bn.Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:Next gave investors plenty to be happy about in their last update, with growth of 9.1pc in its online channel helping sales to exceed group forecasts.While it may be winning the online race, the retail sector remains a tough place to operate.And with a history of under-promising and over-delivering, markets have come to have high expectations.American consumers have become slightly less optimistic about the world’s largest economy this month, although they continue to expect inflation to cool further.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, slipped to 76.5 in March according to preliminary figures, barely below February’s figure of 76.9. Americans’ outlook has essentially remained fixed since January, when it leapt higher.The consumer sentiment figure follows inflation reports this week that showed that, for a second straight month, prices rose at a pace faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2pc target.The consumer price index rose 3.2pc in February compared with a year ago, up from 3.1pc in January.Yet the University of Michigan report showed that Americans’ outlook for inflation hasn’t changed this month compared with February. Consumers expect inflation over the next year to be 3pc, the same as in the previous month.Alex Singleton is taking over now and will keep posting live updates into the evening. Thanks for joining me for another busy week of business news.I’m heading off as I’m starting to feel a little like Bill Gates did when he was pictured watching Carlos Alcaraz taking on Alexander Zverev at Indian Wells.He was lucky that the bees that attacked the tennis players wasn’t nearby.US industrial production ticked higher in February as an improvement in the weather helped boost manufacturing and mining, the Federal Reserve said, although earlier data was revised lower.Production rose 0.1pc in February following a revised fall of 0.5pc in January, the Fed announced.This was slightly above market expectations of no monthly change, but given the sharp downward revision for both December and January, the index remains lower than it was a year ago.Much of February’s rise was down to a 0.8pc rise in manufacturing output, and a 2.2pc increase in the index for mining.“Both gains partly reflected recoveries from weather-related declines in January,” the Fed said, adding that the “warmer-than-typical” month also helped push down the utilities index.High Frequency Economics’ chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi said: “Overall industrial production was slightly better than expected and manufacturing surprised to the upside in February.”She added that the manufacturing sector “continues to face headwinds from higher borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions.”US Industrial production edged up 0.1% in February after falling back 0.5% in January. The output of manufacturing rose 0.8% and mining rose 2.2%. Both reflect a rebound from the weather-induced declines in January. Output of utilities fell in February due to warmer temperatures. pic.twitter.com/In4GdCsVSj— Dr Thomas Kevin Swift (@DrTKSwift) March 15, 2024Contract workers at Northern Rail will strike on Saturday in a dispute over pay, union recognition and working conditions.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) employed by Carlisle Support Services will mount picket lines in Manchester, Leeds and Wigan.About 150 workers are involved in the dispute, including ticket barrier staff.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said:Our members are once again taking strike action against a company who has shown no regard for their staff and is not willing to settle this dispute.We will continue our industrial campaign until we can reach a negotiated settlement.Ultimately, the only, long-term solution is to end contracting out and bring the gateline contract back in house with all the benefits of direct employment from Northern.Oil held near a four-month high after industry chiefs forecast that the Opec cartel would maintain production cuts until the end of the year, resulting in a deficit in the global crude market.International benchmark Brent was down 0.5pc but still trading near $85 a barrel, after advancing 4.3pc over the previous two days.It reached its the highest level since November on Thursday after the International Energy Agency issued its deficit warning.Crude has also been supported this week by the first drop in US stockpiles since January, while Ukraine struck another Russian refinery.JD.com said that “following careful consideration, it does not intend to make an offer for Currys”.Representatives from the Chinese online shopping empire had made contact with the British retailer’s board and held exploratory talks in recent weeks but never made a formal offer.The discussions came as China’s biggest retailer seeks new sources of growth amid a sharp consumer slowdown at home.However, the Currys board indicated it was not prepared to be taken private at a discount, after rejecting two bids from US investor Elliott Management.The electricals retailer’s largest shareholder warned that more foreign corporates will start circling London companies.Redwheel, which holds 14.6pc of shares in Currys, said it was in “complete agreement” with the company’s board over their decision to reject a takeover offer from US hedge fund Elliott.A bidding war for Currys has been brought to a close after the Chinese suitor that had been circling the electricals retailer announced it would not make a bid.Currys shares sank 6pc after JD.com confirmed it does not intend to make an offer.It comes after the US hedge fund Elliott abandoned its attempt to take Currys private after two bids were rejected.Elliott said on Monday that it is “not in an informed position to make an improved offer for Currys on the basis of the public information available to it”.Shares sank on Wall Street today as a $5.3 trillion trading quirk triggered a sudden price swing.The Dow Jones was last down 0.4pc, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.6pc and the Nasdaq Composition has dropped 1.1pc as derivatives traders en masse face decisions about contracts that are scheduled to mature.Traders are forced to either roll over their positions or open new ones, but with $5.3 trillion of contracts scheduled to expire today it will trigger sharp changes in markets.The quarterly phenomenon affecting trades tied to stocks, index options and futures is known as “triple witching”.Rocky Fishman, founder of derivatives analytical firm Asym 500, said:It’s a day in which the direction of the market is very, very difficult to predict.On these big expiration days, the ‘internals’ get so skewed by the expiration that they don’t tell us anything.Therefore, it will be important that investors don’t use today’s action when trying to decipher what is going to happen in the marketplace next week and beyond.An English council has won a $490m (£384m) legal victory against Apple over claims the tech giant exaggerated demand for its iPhones.Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:Apple has agreed to pay shareholders the sum after settling with Norfolk County Council, which led a class action lawsuit against the company.The settlement comes after a five-year lawsuit claiming Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook had misled shareholders by neglecting to identify a downturn in demand in China weeks before a dramatic profit warning in 2019.The case was originally brought against Apple, Mr Cook, and chief financial officer Luca Maestri by the US city of Roseville.Norfolk Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020.Read how the legal battle unfolded.US stock markets fell at the open amid continuing uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate cuts.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc to 38,871.08, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6pc to 5,121.15.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8pc to 16,006.46.Britain homes could one day be powered by electricity generated in America under plans to install up to six power cables across the Atlantic.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:The cables would stretch roughly 3,500 miles across the ocean, reaching depths of up to 11,000 feet, and carrying power roughly equivalent to several nuclear power stations.A group of London investors and energy consultants are behind the ambitions scheme, as they claim technological advances in subsea cables could allow the creation of a global “intercontinental grid”.Simon Ludlam, one of the businessmen backing the project, says such a cable would enable electricity to be traded across the Atlantic, taking advantage of the differences in peak demand as the power line crosses time zones.This graphic shows how transatlantic power sharing works.The main US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading after hotter-than-expected consumer prices and producer prices data.Wall Street was set to end slightly higher this week in spite of figures pointing to sticky inflation, which had sent the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond to a two-week high.Higher inflation adds pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates elevated, pushing traders to rein in bets of a June rate cut to 60pc from 73pc last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve’s meeting next week for hints on the timing of the central bank’s rate-easing cycle.Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank’s global head of economics and thematic research, said: “At the Fed, the big question next week is what they’ll signal in their new dot plot, and whether the median dot still points towards three cuts for 2024, as happened in December.”In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewas up 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.2pc.The Telegraph has won ministerial approval to appoint Mike McTighe as its chairman, as it faces the fallout from the failure of a takeover bid backed by the United Arab Emirates.Business editor Christopher Williams has the latest:Mr McTighe, 70, was previously chairman of Press Acquisitions Limited, the parent company of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine.By becoming chairman of The Telegraph itself, it is expected he will become more closely involved in the day-to-day running of the company and the corporate, regulatory and political challenges posed by the continuing uncertainty over its ownership.Mr McTighe, who is also chairman of BT’s independent network arm Openreach and the FTSE 250 spread betting operator IG Group, said he would seek “clarity and certainty” for The Telegraph to enable it to “continue delivering consistently high-quality and fiercely independent editorial content”.Read on for details.A rail union is warning of possible industrial action against one of the country’s biggest train operators in a dispute over working arrangements for control room staff.The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) said strikes could be held by its members at South Western Railway (SWR) after the two sides failed to resolve a row over the “imposition” of changed working arrangements.The union has now served notice of the first stage of an official process which it warned could lead to industrial action.Gareth Theobald, TSSA organiser for SWR, said:This isn’t merely a shift in working patterns, it’s a stark deviation from well-established norms and we urge SWR to return to the negotiating table without delay to resolve this issue.It’s vital that the company understand the seriousness of the situation. We want to avoid industrial action and ensure the continued provision of rail services to the public.However, SWR should be in no doubt that if staff need to take action, then trains will come to a stop.The pound was set for its biggest weekly fall against the dollar since December, as investors became less certain about summer interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve amid stronger-than-anticipated inflation figures.The slide in sterling comes after a period of relative strength for the currency, which has gained this year on bets the Bank of England will keep rates higher for longer than its peers.However, the pound has been impacted by doubts over the Fed’s plans for its first rate cut, with traders now rating the chances of 54.7pc in June, down from 67pc before the data showed stronger-than-expected producer price inflation.Sterling was last broadly flat versus the dollar on the day at $1.27 but was on track for a 1pc weekly fall. The euro gained 0.1pc versus the pound to 85p.The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at 5.25pc next Thursday, with market pricing favouring the Bank of England cutting rates slightly slower than the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve this year.The British public’s expectations for where inflation will be in a year’s time has fallen to its lowest level in three years amid hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer.The Bank of England’s inflation attitudes survey found that the average expectation of what the rate of inflation will be over the coming year was 3pc, down from 3.3pc in November last year.This was the lowest level since August 2021, before Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, triggering an energy inflation crisis across the globe.It comes as Russia holds national elections which Ukrainian defence intelligence (DIU) said would see Moscow mark ballot papers with the names of dead, missing and captured soldiers in order to boost Putin’s support.French shipping company CMA CGM has agreed to buy part of the media business owned by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, who holds a nearly 25pc stake in BT.CMA CGM’s chief executive Rodolphe Saade intends to create a large media conglomerate in France following the purchase of Altice Media, which owns leading French news channel BFM TV.Altice’s founder and owner Patrick Drahi said the deal would allow further investments into the group’s media such as BFM TV station and RMC radio station.The sales comes after the BT investor said last year that he “feels betrayed” over an alleged corruption scandal within his telecoms empire that triggered the arrest of his right-hand man.The French billionaire said that he was “shocked” after Portuguese authorities launched a criminal investigation into alleged corruption by individuals and senior executives within his sprawling media and telecoms group.BFM is France’s leading TV news channel, and says it has 12 million daily viewers.McDonald’s has apologised after it suffered an IT system outage in its British restaurants, which forced the closure of some sites and left customers unable to order food.The fast food giant insisted it was not hit by a cyber attack after consumers took to social media to complain of issues in several countries including the UK, Japan, China, Sweden and Australia.The Japanese arm of the chain apologised to customers on social media, telling them that they would have to “wait a while” amid the issues.“Many stores across the country have temporarily suspended operations. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers,” it posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.People in Australia, meanwhile, posted pictures of closed restaurants and signs alerting diners that McDonald’s could not accept orders.The cause of the outages is unknown, but it appears to be linked to the chain’s IT systems.Some stores were reported to be operating but only able to take cash orders.A McDonald’s spokesman said: “We are aware of a technology outage which impacted our restaurants. The issue has now been resolved in the UK and Ireland.“We thank customers for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. The issue is not related to a cybersecurity event.”McDonald’s customers have taken to social media to complain about the outage at the fast-food giant:Maccies can't even serve a latte this morning it's that digital there all closed 🤦🏻‍&male;️— Purple bin (@Purple_bin) March 15, 2024It happened in the UK too, I rocked up at work at 6am only to be told every Maccies in the country was broken.

There were 2,102 company insolvencies in February, up 17pc on the same month a year earlier and up 18pc from January.Mr Hudson said:Rather than fresh starts, the spring brings with it additional challenges for already distressed businesses, particularly those in the strained retail and hospitality sectors.Despite hopes of some respite from the Chancellor in last week’s Budget, many will see large rises in their business rate bills from the start of April as well as having to shoulder increased wage costs as the new National Living Wage takes effect.While the positive view is that the UK’s recent recession was short-lived, factors like these – combined with increased borrowing costs and consumer confidence remaining weak – will continue to weigh heavily on UK plc.The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has grown as businesses battle against high interest rates.Some 2,102 firms went under in February, up 17pc on the same month a year earlier and up 18pc from January.There were 10,136 individuals who declared insolvency in February, which was 23pc higher than in the same month in the previous year.European stock markets are on track for their strongest run in six years amid hopes for interest rate cuts.The Stoxx 600, which includes companies across Europe’s main markets, including the FTSE 100, is poised to notch an eighth consecutive weekly gain after hitting a series of record highs.If confirmed, it would be the longest run in six years, with the market boosted today by Vodafone’s announcement today that it is selling its Italian business for €8bn (£6.8bn) to Swisscom.It comes amid growing hopes for interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank over the summer.However, the Stoxx 600 was flat today amid stronger-than-expected US inflation figures put the brakes on the rate cut excitement.Sir Trevor Phillips, the broadcaster and chairman of Green Park executive recruitment organisation, has said his company’s clients think racism is common in the workplace.His recruitment company puts 500 people into executive level and boardroom jobs each year, a third of whome are from ethnic minorities and half of which are female.Sir Trevor told BBC Radio 4:If you have a woman in the room, it is far less likely that people are going to say dumb, sexist stuff.If you have a person from an ethnic minority in the room, it is far less likely they are going to say dumb, racist stuff.The fact that our clients regard this as important, tells us without a doubt that they know this kind of talk is commonplace and they would rather not have it.He added: “Nobody has a right to say dumb, racist stuff any more than they have a right to come into the office and gob on the carpet.”The FTSE 100 was little changed amid a downbeat mood on global markets after persistent US wholesale inflation created uncertainty about interest rate cuts.The exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged down 0.1pc, while the domestically-oriented FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc.Markets tracked dour sentiment from Wall Street and Asian equities, as higher-than-expected consumer and producer inflation readings dampened investor hopes of an early interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.Investors will now watch the Bank of England’s interest rate decision next week, where it is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 16-year highs of 5.25pc.Among individual stocks, Vodafone UK rose 4.2pc after Swisscom said it will buy Vodafone Italia for €8bn (£6.8bn) to merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb.British Airways owner IAG climbed as much as 4.6pc to lead the FTSE 100 after a double upgrade from BNP Paribas.Berkeley Homes expects to make £1.5bn of pre-tax profits over the next three years as the property sector moves past the woes caused by high interest rates.The developer said in a trading update that it expects to make a profit of £550m this financial year - as analysts had expected - despite sales rates remaining around a third lower than the previous year.It said it will return £227m to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks by the end of September.Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the company is “sitting on solid ground” as its focus on London and higher-end homes paid off. He said:While markets aren’t forecasting much of an uplift in the housing market in 2024, there are some early signs that pressures are beginning to ease for housebuilders.Mortgage rates have fallen from peak levels, real wages are growing and build-cost inflation has pulled back, giving some relief to industry margins.Berkeley’s also sitting on a hefty chunk of cash, so there’s plenty of scope for continued shareholder returns through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.Berkeley Homes shares fell 0.3pc in early trading.The FTSE 100 was flat as trading began following uncertainty that also gripped Wall Street and Asian markets following mixed US economic figures on Thursday.The UK’s blue-chip index began the day little changed at 7,743.96 while the midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc to 19,531.84.Bitcoin has dropped back sharply from its recent record high amid fears the latest surge in cryptocurrencies is a bubble.The world’s largest digital token fell more than 5pc in the Asian session to bottom at $66,629.96. It was last down 3.9pc at $68,644.80.The choppy moves in the world’s largest cryptocurrency came a day after its charge to a high of $73,803.25, setting a new record for a fourth straight day.Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett told Bloomberg TV that markets are showing the characteristics of a bubble.He pointed to the surge in the technology sector’s so-called Magnificent Seven stocks and the all-time highs in crypto.Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, said:Bitcoin has an established history of getting volatile and ruthless after hitting (a) record high.And not only did it recently hit a new high, but it looks like the (Federal Reserve) won’t be as dovish as traders had hoped.China’s property crisis took another turn for the worse as home prices continued to fall last month.Both new and used home prices declined in February compared to a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidised housing, fell 1.9pc from a year earlier, steeper than January’s 1.2pc drop.Meanwhile, existing-home prices dropped 5.2pc, worsening from 4.5pc fall in January across all 70 cities.China has been grappling a post-pandemic economic downturn that has led to a significant slump in property investment across the country, which has led to a slowdown in growth.One of China’s biggest housebuilders, Evergrande, collapsed in 2021, which spooked the whole market. Other developers have also been going bust.Vodafone has confirmed the sale of its Italian business to Swisscom for €8bn (£6.8bn), weeks after rejecting an approach by French billionaire Xavier Niel.The British telecoms giant also announced a €4bn (£3.4bn) share buyback plan.The Swiss company said in a statement that it would merge Vodafone Italia with its own Italian subsidiary, Fastweb.It marks the latest deal pursued by Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle as she looks to trim the sprawling telecoms giant and return it to growth.The company has recently agreed a £15bn deal to merge with Three in the UK, creating the country’s largest mobile network.Ms Della Valle said:Today, I am announcing the third and final step in the reshaping of our European operations.Going forward, our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets - where we hold strong positions - enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe. This will be coupled with our acceleration in B2B, as we continue to take share in an expanding digital services market.Nissan and Honda have said they will work together on developing electric vehicles as they try to fend off competition from Chinese rivals.The chief executives of the two car makers appeared together in a news conference in Tokyo to announce that Japan’s second and third biggest carmakers would look into possibilities, scope and areas that show potential for collaboration in electrification and auto intelligence technology.Their agreement is non-binding, and discussions will now start, they said.It comes as Japanese manufacturers battle strong competition in China, with both Honda and Nissan are reportedly planning to cut production capacity in China as sales continue to fall. Mitsubishi has pulled out of the world’s second largest economy altogether.China’s BYD announced plans to roll out new models and expand its network in Japan.Seiji Sugiura, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory, said the deal is advantageous because “both the parties are in trouble”.He added if they collaborate on batteries, that “will save them a lot of cost”.The competition watchdog has launched an investigation into a £2.5bn merger between two of Britain’s biggest house builders.Barratt Developments, the country’s largest housebuilder, announced plans last month to buy competitor Redrow in a deal that will allow the combined company to build around 22,000 homes each year.However, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has revealed it is investigating whether the deal may “result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services”.Both housebuilders are now facing two separate inquiries by the regulator after the CMA last month opened an investigation looking at suspected illegal information sharing between Britain’s biggest housebuilders amid fears that collusion in the industry has pushed up prices.The watchdog will investigate the practices of Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley, Bloor Homes, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey, and Vistry.The CMA today issued an invitation for comments on Barratt Developments’ proposed £2.5bn takeover of Redrow.Interested parties have until April 2 to submit their views before the regulator begins the next phase of its inquiry.Thanks for joining me.

2024-03-15 17:03:57+00:00,"Analyst warns that a TikTok ban could lead to major trouble for Apple, Big Tech","The U.S. House on Wednesday passed a bill that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok. As the legislation makes its way to the Senate, Deepwater Management's Gene Munster thanks a ban could prove to be a blow to U.S. tech giants including Apple, Nvidia and Tesla. The House on Wednesday voted (352-65) in favor of a bill that would give TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance 180 days to divest the app, or face a ban.The swift passage of the bill, which was only introduced the week before, serves as the culmination of U.S. regulatory pushes against the popular social media platform.The bill is now on the road toward a Senate vote, though an exact timeline is unclear. The Washington Post reported Friday that the bill will likely face a much longer approval process in the Senate than it did in the House. President Joe Biden has said that he will sign the bill if it passes the Senate.""This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it's a ban,"" TikTok said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses and the 170 million Americans who use our service.""Related: High-profile investor calls TikTok ruling a 'slippery slope'With its Senate path still unclear, Deepwater Management's Gene Munster said Friday that he sees a 50% chance that nothing will happen to TikTok, a 25% chance that the app will be sold and a 25% chance that the app will be banned.Munster thinks that if TikTok is either banned or divested, ""Chinese leadership will argue U.S. tech companies are using their products to spy on the Chinese,"" something that could spark retaliatory efforts against U.S. companies.He said that 23% of Tesla's  (TSLA)  revenue comes from China; it's 18% for Apple  (AAPL)  and 8% for chip giant Nvidia  (NVDA) .Munster noted that, historically, Chinese leadership has ""largely supported Apple products"" over the past eight years, despite tensions between the U.S. and China. Still, he believes there will likely be ""modest pressure"" on China iPhone sales and Tesla sale numbers if the bill becomes law.""Censorship is not the answer, data privacy legislation is."" — Fight for the FutureWedbush's Dan Ives has echoed a similar impression, noting ""potential retaliatory actions China can head towards the likes of Apple and Tesla and U.S. Big Tech,"" though he said that a potential retaliation would likely impact Apple and Tesla the most, particularly as both companies' sales have been struggling in the country lately.Ives likewise sees a 25% chance that TikTok will get banned.Related: Facebook whistleblower explains why Mark Zuckerberg's latest hearing is different than the othersEfforts to ban TikTok have faced harsh criticism in the past, as other social media platforms collect and share the same data that TikTok collects, and some — including X — collect more.Critics have argued that foreign adversaries, including China, could simply purchase this data through data brokers, making a ban that targets TikTok alone unlikely to accomplish much in the way of real data security.""If Congress really cares about the data abuse Americans are subject to because of surveillance capitalist business models, they should pass comprehensive privacy legislation that would stop all Big Tech companies from harvesting our data,"" Fight for the Future, a nonprofit digital rights group, said in a statement. ""The data of Americans is already susceptible to bad actors, foreign and domestic, because Congress has waited so long to act. Censorship is not the answer, data privacy legislation is.""The TikTok bill: if the American people are going to be spied on by an amoral surveillance capitalist data monster, it will be an American-owned amoral surveillance capitalist data monster.— Jacob Silverman (@SilvermanJacob) March 13, 2024Ryan Martin, lead partner at Infosys Consulting’s IT Risk, Governance Risk & Compliance and Cybersecurity practice, told TheStreet that while the bill might serve as a good way to begin a discussion about personal privacy and data protection online, it likely is not enough to actually protect consumer data.""A ban on TikTok could reduce the risk of one entity being coerced to disclose non-public private information to China — but the extent of readily available information on social media in general dwarfs that in my opinion,"" Martin said.

2024-03-15 13:02:36+00:00,English council wins £400m payout from Apple,"An English council has won a $490m (£384m) legal victory against Apple over claims the tech giant exaggerated demand for its iPhones.Apple has agreed to pay shareholders the sum after settling with Norfolk County Council, which led a class action lawsuit against the company.The settlement comes after a five-year lawsuit claiming Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook had misled shareholders by neglecting to identify a downturn in demand in China weeks before a dramatic profit warning in 2019.The case was originally brought against Apple, Mr Cook, and chief financial officer Luca Maestri by the US city of Roseville. Norfolk Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020.The payout is set to be shared by investors who apply for damages and say they were affected by Apple allegedly misleading investors. It is unclear how much the Norfolk pension fund itself will receive.The lawsuit had claimed that Mr Cook misled shareholders as Apple faced a drop in demand after the release of the iPhone XS and XR in 2018.Mr Cook said in late 2018 that while Apple was “seeing pressure” in some emerging markets, “I would not put China in that category”.Two months later Apple unveiled a rare profit warning that blamed weakness in China, leading to shares being briefly suspended and $55bn being wiped off the company’s value.Apple and its executives had challenged the case ahead of a trial, which had been scheduled for later this year. Dozens of Apple emails had been released as part of the lawsuit discussing the company’s business in China, while executives had been questioned ahead of the case.In legal filings, lawyers for Norfolk Council say the settlement “is a tremendous result” and the third-largest amount recovered in a class action of this type in Northern California.They said that Apple continues to deny it had violated US stock market rules or misled investors.“Defendants have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this Action, but in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive, and distracting, have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action,” the filings said.Lawyers will receive up to 25pc of the payout, which will now have to be approved by a judge.A spokesman for the Norfolk Pension Fund, said: “We are proud of this recovery for investors. We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals. When and where it’s warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants’ investments are harmed by fraud.”Apple was contacted for comment.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/uk-council-wins-400m-payout-130236711.html
2024-03-15 09:40:00+00:00,"Better ""Magnificent Seven"" Buy: Nvidia vs. Apple Stock","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are a group of megacap technology companies that have thrived over the past few years and led this new bull market, but it's not been a smooth ride for every member of that group.Two key members, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), are moving in opposite directions so far in 2024. Apple's stock price has fallen 10% since January, while Nvidia's has risen over 80%.So, which one of these two stocks is the better buy going forward?2024 hasn't been kind to the personal electronics giant. The iPhone maker has fallen more than 10% since January. Why? It's most likely due to declining growth expectations. Apple's revenue growth has slowed significantly, which analysts expect will trickle down to slower earnings growth.Additionally, word out of China is that iPhone sales there are slipping. According to research by Counterpoint, iPhone sales were down 24% year over year in China through the first six weeks of the year, as consumers pass on iPhones for Chinese alternatives.Now, Apple is still a marvelous company. Investing legend Warren Buffett has called it the best business his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns. Apple makes up over 40% of Berkshire's $363 billion stock portfolio. However, it is understandable that Apple faces questions about its long-term growth. Growing isn't always easy for a massive $2.6 trillion company.On the other hand, Nvidia has been growing shockingly fast. The company is benefiting from a surge of investments related to AI. Nvidia's AI chips are today's dominant market leader, with an estimated 80% market share. That's shown up in fascinating financial results that have seen Nvidia's revenue and profits go parabolic, launching the stock higher in the process.The big question is whether this is a burst or a prolonged trend. Lisa Su, the CEO of Nvidia's competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, believes the AI chip market will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. Considering Nvidia's companywide revenue is still ""just"" $61 billion as the market leader, there's a lot of potential upside if this prediction comes true.Investors might be understandably shy toward a stock that has risen so much so fast. However, the fundamentals have (so far) seemingly justified Nvidia's price action. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. For starters, Nvidia does tons of business with relatively few deep-pocketed customers. Losing any of them could put a big dent in revenue. It remains to be seen if AMD and other chip companies can encroach on Nvidia's market share over the coming years.Choosing between these two investments depends on whether you believe Apple is more likely to rebound or if Nvidia will run out of steam. Looking at fundamentals, Nvidia has a clear advantage. I like using the PEG ratio to gauge how much I pay for a stock's earnings growth. In other words, how much bang for your buck are you getting?Comparing the two stocks below reveals a clear winner:CompanyForward P/E RatioExpected Long-Term Average Annual EPS GrowthPEG RatioApple26.09.4%2.7Nvidia35.634.8%1.0Data source: Ycharts. EPS = earnings per share.Lower is better for the PEG ratio. I generally like buying stocks with a PEG ratio of 1.5 or less. As you can see above, Apple is far more expensive than Nvidia for the growth analysts expect over the long term.Could Nvidia fall short of analyst estimates? Could Apple outperform its expectations? Of course!But the gap is so vast today that it's hard to justify picking Apple over Nvidia, especially when the company puts up the financials to justify the hype the stock is getting. That makes Nvidia the better Magnificent Seven stock to buy until proven otherwise.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-15 09:06:00+00:00,Here Are All 7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling,"For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street's flagship index, the S&P 500. Since taking the reins as CEO, the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of 4,927,141%, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024. That compares to a total return, including dividends paid, of around 33,500% for the S&P 500 over the same period.Riding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a moneymaking strategy for decades, which is made all the easier thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors are buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for money managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management.Although most investors are intrigued to see what the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying, understanding why Buffett and his team are selling certain stocks can be just as insightful.Based on Berkshire's most recent 13F, Warren Buffett and his team are selling seven stocks.The first sizable holding that found itself on the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is media company Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett's company pared down nearly a third of its position, which had stood at north of 93 million shares.The catalyst for dumping more than 30 million shares looks to be Paramount's undesirable balance sheet. More specifically, the company is lugging around $14.6 billion in long-term debt, compared to just $2.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of the end of 2023. With cord-cutting ongoing and Paramount's streaming segment still losing money, investors (including Buffett) have begun to lose patience.The other side of the coin is that Paramount's streaming segment losses are lessening thanks to higher subscription prices being passed along to users. Further, legacy media companies tend to enjoy a resurgence in ad spending during major election years. Although Paramount Global clearly has concerns to address, things may not be as dire as its poor stock performance would suggest.Another high-profile name that took a big haircut in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio during the fourth quarter is personal computing and printing services provider HP (NYSE: HPQ). Buffett and his aides dumped close to 78% of Berkshire's stake, compared to what was held on Sept. 30, 2023.The impetus behind this selling activity may have to do with the sluggishness of personal computer (PC) sales. Though PC sales surged during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they've meaningfully retraced with most employees returning to the office. With no sales growth forecast for the current year, HP's 3.6% dividend yield simply isn't enough of a lure to keep Buffett and his team interested.HP also looks like a perfect example of a ""fair company at a wonderful price"" that Buffett would prefer to avoid. Although HP stock can be purchased for a mere 8 times forward year earnings, the company's growth days are long gone. Now reliant on relatively low-margin products and printing services, HP lacks the needle-moving results Berkshire's brightest minds desire.Perhaps the most surprising selling activity during the fourth quarter was the roughly 10 million shares Buffett and his investing ""lieutenants"" parted ways with in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Keep in mind that selling 10 million shares only reduced Berkshire's stake in its top holding by 1.1%.Chances are the Oracle of Omaha hasn't changed his tune on what he previously referred to as ""a better business than any we own."" Apple's physical product innovation has led the way for more than a decade, with the company now also emphasizing high-margin subscription services. To boot, Apple has repurchased $650.9 billion of its own common stock since the start of 2013, which is tops among public companies.The most logical reason Buffett and his investing crew pared down their Apple stake is to offset realized investment losses from Paramount Global and HP. Buffett's company is sitting on an estimated $119 billion in unrealized gains on its Apple stock.A popular holding that was given the heave-ho from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter is insurance and investment company Markel Group (NYSE: MKL), which has been dubbed something of a ""mini-Berkshire"" given its penchant for making investments. Buffett and his team dumped their entire position in Markel, which had been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2022.There are two educated guesses as to why Markel found itself on the chopping block. The likeliest answer is valuation. Since 2015, Markel Group had traded at or below 120% of its book value on only a handful of occasions. One of those instances was during the first quarter of 2022. With Markel's premium-to-book value nearing 50% just prior to the start of October 2023, the luster of getting a ""deal"" may have worn off.The other possibility is Weschler or Combs, not Buffett, cut Markel loose. Buffett's investment aides are considerably more active on the trading front than he is, and this position was ultimately held less than two years.Brazil-focused fintech company StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE), which had been a five-year holding in Berkshire's portfolio, was also shown the door during the fourth quarter.The motivation for Buffett and his team to part ways with StoneCo probably had to do with the company's debt-driven challenges. Brazil's central bank raised interest rates to as high as 13.75% in 2022 to get the country's inflation rate under control. Unfortunately, StoneCo's loan division was backed by debt, which sent its servicing costs soaring. Even though management has addressed these issues, StoneCo is still something of a work in progress.On the other hand, StoneCo has its fingers in far more than just payments in Brazil's economy. It offers banking and credit solutions, as well as software, to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Although add-on service adoption is climbing, StoneCo has penetrated just a small fraction of the fintech market in Brazil.The sixth stock Buffett and his team kicked to the curb during the December-ended quarter was longtime holding Globe Life (NYSE: GL). Prior to its departure, life and supplemental health insurance company Globe Life had been a continuous holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for more than two decades.Valuation looks to be the most sensible reason behind Buffett & Co.'s decision to sell. Shares of the company more than doubled following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, sending its price-to-book value to nearly 300% during the fourth quarter. At no point during the 22 years that Berkshire held shares of Globe Life did it sustain a book value of more than 200% for any length of time, let alone near 300%.Buffett and his team are also known for concentrating Berkshire's investments in their top ideas. Globe Life never met the definition of a core holding, which ultimately sealed its fate.Last but not least, the Oracle of Omaha and his team booted homebuilder D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter.This is one of the biggest head-scratchers of all considering shares of D.R. Horton were only acquired during the June-ended quarter. Since Warren Buffett is a firm believer in holding wonderful businesses for extended periods, the purchase and subsequent sale of D.R. Horton suggests that Ted Weschler and/or Todd Combs were the masterminds behind this relatively quick trade.History may also have played a role in dumping shares of D.R. Horton. Homebuilders aren't known for delivering outsized investment returns. Depending on Berkshire's entry and exit, it could have been up north of 50% on its stake in D.R. Horton in under nine months. That's an incredible gain for a traditionally slow-moving, highly cyclical industry. With various money-based metrics and predictive indicators alluding to a possible recession in 2024, locking in gains may have been prudent.Should you invest $1,000 in Paramount Global right now?Before you buy stock in Paramount Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paramount Global wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-15 04:06:05+00:00,Apple acquires AI startup specializing in overlooking manufacturing components,"Apple has added another AI startup to its acquisition list with Canada-based DarwinAI, which specializes in vision-based tech to observe components during manufacturing to improve efficiency, Bloomberg reported.While Apple or DarwinAI haven't announced this deal, several members of the startup's team joined Apple's machine learning teams in January, as per their LinkedIn profiles.DarwinAI had raised over $15 million in funding across various rounds from investors including BDC Capital’s Deep Tech Venture Fund, Honeywell Ventures, Obvious Ventures, and Inovia Capital. BDC Capital confirms on its website that it has received an exit from DarwinAI, whereas Obvious Venture has updated its portfolio to reflect that the startup has been acquired.BDC Capital and Obvious Venture didn't comment on the story at the time of writing. Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.As Bloomberg noted in its report, apart from helping with manufacturing efficiency, DarwinAI uses techniques to make AI models smaller and faster. This could be useful for on-device generative AI features Apple hopes to introduce in iOS 18 this year.Apple has lagged in releasing gen-AI-powered features as compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. In February, Tim Cook said the company plans to introduce such features ""later this year.""“We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Cook said during a quarterly earnings call with analysts.Last year the Apple top exec had confirmed investment into gen-AI efforts. Apple's job listings have suggested the company is exploring infusing AI in multiple internal and external areas including, Siri, developer tools, and customer support.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-in-overlooking-manufacturing-components/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-040605041.html
2024-03-15 01:55:53+00:00,Hon Hai Jumps by Most in Years After Strong AI Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. shares saw their biggest intraday jump in more than three years after the company forecast strong growth for its AI hardware sales this year.Most Read from BloombergMillennium Trader Scored $40 Million Windfall in Egypt FX PlungeSpaceX Starship Nears Orbit, But Is Lost Before Return to EarthApple Buys Canadian AI Startup as It Races to Add FeaturesBond Yields Jump as Hot Inflation Curbs Fed Wagers: Markets WrapBiden’s Best Shot Against Trump Lies in ‘Blue Wall’ StatesThe Taiwanese firm expects its artificial intelligence server business to grow by 40% this year and is targeting a 40% share of that overall market, Chairman Young Liu said on an earnings call Thursday. The company, known also as Foxconn, reported its second straight quarter of strong profit growth after lucrative AI hardware sales helped offset weakness in iPhone and consumer electronics demand.Shares jumped as much as 9.5% in Taipei on Friday, extending a rally since the start of this year on growing optimism about Foxconn’s opportunity to benefit from AI demand. The world’s largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones wasn’t among the initial cohort of companies boosted by the AI frenzy, but investors and analysts see it likely to gain a growing share. This month, it was reported to have secured a major order from longtime US partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and UBS Group AG upgraded their price targets for Hon Hai after the company posted a 33% rise in net income to NT$53.2 billion ($1.7 billion) in the quarter ended December.“The company’s competitive strength in providing a total solution (including liquid cooling and switches) through vertical integration would position it well for more project wins,” Citi analysts Carrie Liu and Michael Hung wrote after the results.For the current period, Hon Hai had forecast that sales would decline again, as it’s coming off an elevated comparison base from the post-pandemic recovery period early last year. AI sales have helped it improve profit while weathering a down year for the iPhone, the flagship product that first brought Foxconn global renown.“The business saw a good sequential rebound in Q4 partly driven by the AI-focused side, but if you take a step back and look at 2023 as a whole, it was a relatively weak year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea said. “The company should now have a much better year as its main customers start to rebuild inventory.”JPMorgan earlier this week said that Foxconn’s rally could extend as the market is betting increasingly on the company’s prospects in AI server infrastructure from the second half of the year. Analysts including Gokul Hariharan estimate that Hon Hai’s AI revenue and gross profit exposure is likely to be in the 10-12% range in 2025.Still, with Apple making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. This month, Counterpoint Research said iPhone sales in China fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.(Updates with analyst reaction and chart)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?When It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/iphone-maker-hon-hai-profit-062358359.html
2024-03-14 23:21:09+00:00,Warren Buffett Said Steve Jobs Completely Ignored His Advice On How To Invest Apple's Cash,"Warren Buffett shared a look into a conversation with Steve Jobs about Apple Inc.'s financial strategy during a 2012 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”In the ""Ask Warren"" segment, Buffett said, “It was an interesting conversation because I hadn’t talked to him in a long time. He said, ‘We’ve got all this cash. What should we do with it?’ So we went over the alternatives. It was kind of interesting.”This dialogue between two industry titans sheds light on the decision-making process at one of the world’s most valuable companies.Don't Miss:For many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough?Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.Jobs, known for his transformative role in making Apple a global technology leader, reached out to Buffett to seek advice on the company’s cash-management strategies. Buffett, a legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., outlined the four primary options available for deploying cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, or holding onto it.Despite Jobs’s acknowledgment that Apple’s stock was undervalued, indicating that buybacks could be a wise choice, he ultimately decided against taking any action, preferring to maintain the company’s cash reserves.“I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,"" Buffett said. ""And then I asked him the question, I said, ‘I would use it for buybacks if I thought my stock was undervalued.’ And I said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ The stock was 200-and-something. He said, ‘I think my stock is very undervalued.’ I said, ‘Well, what better to do with your money?’""Jobs liked having the cash and that was what he ultimately decided was his best option. Buffett added that Jobs interpreted their conversation as Buffett endorsing his decision to hold onto the cash. ""I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash,"" Buffett said.Trending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?The discussion between Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett underscores a cautious financial approach, contrasting sharply with the bold actions of Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook. Cook’s tenure at Apple witnessed aggressive stock buybacks, totaling over $500 billion in the last decade, a sum surpassing the market capitalization of major corporations like Visa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and ExxonMobil Corp. This demonstrates Apple’s steadfast commitment to repurchasing its shares.Apple’s buyback strategy not only boosted shareholder value but also increased Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in the company, despite no additional investment. Berkshire Hathaway, holding nearly 6% of Apple, benefited from these repurchases.Buffett publicly endorsed Apple’s buyback endeavors, citing their positive impact on Berkshire’s holdings and Apple’s ecosystem in his 2021 letter to shareholders.While Jobs prioritized liquidity, Cook utilized Apple’s financial robustness to actively manage its capital structure. This approach solidified Apple’s leadership in the technology sector, delivering value to both shareholders and stakeholders.Read Next: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

But one of its core technologies is making artificial intelligence systems smaller and faster. That work that could be helpful to Apple, which is focused on running AI on devices rather than entirely in the cloud.Alexander Wong, an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who helped build the business, has joined Apple as a director in its AI group as part of the deal.In response to questions about the deal, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” but doesn’t discuss its plans.Apple shares briefly gained on the news, rising more than 1% to $173.37. It was trading at $172.92 as of 1:29 p.m. in New York, down about 10% for the year.Waterloo, Ontario-based DarwinAI had raised more than $15 million as of 2022, according to the Canadian startup community Communitech. It received investments from Honeywell Ventures and Inovia Capital, among other venture capital firms. The startup also has worked with companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Intel Corp., according to Communitech.The under-the-radar acquisition comes ahead of a big AI push for Apple this year. The company is adding features to its iOS 18 software that rely on generative AI, the technology behind ChatGPT and other groundbreaking tools. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple will “break new ground” in AI this year, and an announcement is expected as soon as the company’s worldwide developers conference in June.Despite having acquired more AI companies than most rivals over the past decade, Apple has fallen behind in the generative AI market.

2024-03-14 13:33:13+00:00,"Apple Stock Has 31% Upside, According to This Wall Street Analyst","After climbing 48% in 2023, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed so far in 2024. The stock is down about 11% year to date, in part, due to worries regarding slowing iPhone sales in China. However, one Wall Street analyst sees this price dip as a buying opportunity.Earlier this week, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan renewed his $225 price target on the stock. That price target represents a potential upside of about 31% in the next 12 months or so over the current share price of $171.A recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year over year in the first six weeks of the year. This seems to be what is weighing on the stock right now, but Mohan noted that Apple has an important option for dealing with this.Apple does an effective job of lowering the prices of its older phones to maintain steady demand, according to Mohan. The analyst also says Apple's long-term trend of shifting customers toward higher-value units can help offset weak sales in China. China generated 21% of Apple's operating profit last quarter.China sales are getting the blame for the stock's recent performance, but the shares were due for a correction. The stock traded at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 32 at the end of 2023 and now trade at a more reasonable P/E of 27, which is still higher than the market average.Despite weakness in China, Apple's earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, mostly driven by growing revenue in the higher-margin services category, and the company's ongoing share repurchases.It might take a while for the market to come around, but Apple has plenty of strengths outside of China to deliver returns to investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-14 13:30:09+00:00,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Apple (AAPL): Should You Buy?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Check price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is AAPL Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.  reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.In fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.These stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.However, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.This wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion.

2024-03-14 11:28:29+00:00,12 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now,"In this article, we discuss 12 best Guru stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios. Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated.

It also contrasts sharply with remarks by Foxconn Chairman Young Liu in November that the world's largest contract electronics maker had ""relatively conservative and neutral"" expectations for 2024.""We see very strong demand for AI servers from our clients,"" Liu told an online earnings conference, adding that he expects the business to have revenue growth of more than 40% this year.The AI server market was likely to see 30% growth each year between 2023 and 2025, and Foxconn's growth would be in line with that or even higher, he said.October-December net profit for the Taiwanese company came in at T$53.1 billion ($1.7 billion), handily beating a T$43.5 billion LSEG SmartEstimate. The 33% surge in profit was the strongest year-on-year growth logged for a quarter since March 2021.In addition to robust demand for AI servers, it also had better-than-expected sales of cloud and networking products and smart consumer electronics.Apple last month reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business though its China sales missed analysts' estimates.In the fourth quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 58% of Foxconn's revenue while cloud and networking products which include servers contributed 20%.Although it expects healthy growth over 2024, Foxconn cautioned that first-quarter revenue was set to come in lower than the same period a year ago when sales surged after pandemic restrictions were lifted in China.Chief Financial Officer David Huang also said that 2024 growth in capital expenditure would at least match last year's rate, partly due to the company's drive to diversify investment around the world and expand into areas such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.Foxconn's capital expenditure climbed 14% in 2023 to around T$111.7 billion ($3.6 billion).

That beat an average of analyst estimates of NT$43.8 billion, helped by a large one-time gain.The company’s shares are up more than 15% this year, buoyed by growing optimism about Foxconn’s opportunity to benefit from demand for artificial intelligence servers and hardware. The Taiwanese assembler, known also as Foxconn, wasn’t among the initial cohort of companies boosted by the AI frenzy, but investors and analysts see it likely to gain a growing share of such business. This month, it was reported to have secured a major order from longtime US partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.For the current period, Hon Hai had forecast that sales would decline again, as it’s coming off an elevated comparison base from the post-pandemic recovery period early last year. AI sales have helped it improve profit while weathering a down year for the iPhone, the flagship product that first brought Foxconn global renown.“The business saw a good sequential rebound into Q4 partly driven by the AI-focused side, but if you take a step back and look at 2023 as a whole, it was a relatively weak year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea said. “The company should have a much better year as their main customers start to rebuild inventory.”JPMorgan earlier this week said that Foxconn’s rally could extend as the market is betting increasingly on the company’s prospects in AI server infrastructure from the second half of the year. Analysts including Gokul Hariharan estimate that Hon Hai’s AI revenue and gross profit exposure is likely to be in the 10-12% range in 2025.Still, with Apple making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. This month, Counterpoint Research said iPhone sales in China fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.(Updates with analyst reaction)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/iphone-maker-hon-hai-profit-062358359.html

The likelihood of the bill passing through the Senate and landing on President Biden's desk has been called into question considering the timing of the presidential election and the usual slow reaction time from the Senate.Wolfe Research Head of US Policy and Politics Tobin Marcus joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the bill and what are the most likely next steps through Congress and beyond.When asked if it will ever get through the Senate and be signed into law, Marcus claims: ""I think the realistic avenue for getting this done is the next annual defense policy bill, the so-called NDAA for FY [Fiscal Year] '25, which will get done sometimes after the election... that's a bill that happens every year, sort of one of the last bona fide bipartisan things that gets done. TikTok has some level of national security angle to it, it's not a defense policy question but it is somewhat germane...""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoJOSH LIPTON: The House of Representatives passing a controversial bill to give China's ByteDance six months to sell TikTok or face a US ban of the app. That bill which raised issues of national security easily passed by a wide margin in the House. But it is not a done deal yet. Of course, still faces major hurdles in the Senate.Joining us now is Tobin Marcus, Wolfe Research Head of US Policy and Politics. Tobin, it is good to see you. So, Tobin, the House passes this bill by a landslide? But, of course, now our attention turns to what happens in the Senate, what do you think is going to happen there, Tobin?TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, I think mostly, a lot of nothing is going to happen. We're going to see a lot of comments from senators. We're going to see a lot of people saying that they agree that TikTok is a threat, that they want to take a close look at this bill, that they have concerns about the specific approach.But, in general, the Senate tends not to feel a lot of pressure just because the house happens to vote on something, multiple different folks in the Senate, not least of them Maria Cantwell, Chair of Senate Commerce Committee which is one of the committees that will have jurisdiction here, have been working on their own approaches to TikTok for quite a while now.And the fact that the House suddenly leapt into action on this bill over the course of the past week or so, I think is not necessarily going to make them feel like they need to go ahead and do something right away. And signals from Senate leadership are they're going to run a normal process where everyone is in the loop and everyone gets time to weigh in on the approach, which means probably that this is going to drag out without clear signals in the Senate longer past the point that there is an obvious vehicle to attach it to.Because we're getting closer and closer to the election. And there are sort of not that many bills that are going to get done between now and the end of the year.JULIE HYMAN: So if it doesn't get done now, will it ever get done?TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, I mean, I think that the realistic avenue for getting this done is the next annual defense policy bill, the so-called NDAA, for FY 25, which will get done sometime after the election in the November, December, January time frame. That's a bill that happens every year, one of the last bona fide bipartisan things that gets done.TikTok has some level of national security angle to it. It's not a defense policy question, but it is somewhat germane. So I think it's a foregone conclusion that we see, an attempt to attach this bill to the House version of NDAA.Possible that the Senate goes along with that in putting their version together over the summer. So I think that's sort of the next threat that we're looking at. And even if they miss that boat, you know, I don't think that the noise is going away on this, whether it's this bill or some other bill. Like the concern is clear.JOSH LIPTON: And, Tobin, if this did become law, I'm just interested to get your take. How do you think the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party would respond, Tobin? Would there be a risk do you think they retaliate in China?A lot of American companies do a lot of business over there. From Apple, to Tesla, to NVIDIA.TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, so it's an interesting question. It's come up a lot over the course of variety of different economic restrictions the US has rolled out. On China, not least of them the exports on or the restrictions on semiconductor capital exports that have been rolled out and tightened over the course of the past couple of years.And, generally, we have not seen that much in the way of direct Chinese retaliation. I mean, certainly, directly in the social media and internet advertising domain. It is already the case that the sort of big US internet Giants are not allowed to have much penetration into China.And, you know, I think they have a lot to lose in terms of really sort of draconian retaliation that is essentially unrelated to what's going on here. If they were to go after Apple, like there are a lot of jobs and economic activity inside of China that are connected to Apple's manufacturing footprint there.So I think probably we'll see some symbolic actions. But I don't know that it really qualitatively changes the US-China economic relationship or the kind of risks that we face there.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/noise-isnt-going-away-tiktok-211041721.html
2024-03-13 20:23:32+00:00,It’s not all doom and gloom for Apple in 2024,"Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.Those headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.And, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.Wall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.Plus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added.Apple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”Apple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.Apple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway.According to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”But one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.That, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.All of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-13 18:33:49+00:00,"UPDATE 2-Epic Games says Apple violated App Store injunction, seeks contempt order","(Adds Apple comments, Europe developments, case citation, byline)By Jonathan StempelMarch 13 (Reuters) - Epic Games, which makes the popular video game ""Fortnite,"" on Wednesday accused Apple of violating an injunction governing its lucrative App Store, and asked a U.S. judge to hold Apple in contempt and end its ""sham"" compliance.The companies have been battling in court since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through its App Store, where it charges app developers up to 30% commissions on in-app purchases.A September 2021 injunction by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, let developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content.In a filing with the California court, Epic alleged that Apple is in ""blatant violation"" of that injunction, despite the Cupertino, California-based company's assurance in a Jan. 16 court notice that it had ""fully complied.""Epic said Apple has imposed new rules and a new 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which taken together make the links ""commercially unusable.""The Cary, North Carolina-based developer also said Apple continues to ""categorically prohibit"" buttons, and still forbids some apps from telling users they have other purchasing options.""Apple's goal is clear: to prevent purchasing alternatives from constraining the supracompetitive fees it collects on purchases of digital goods and services,"" Epic said. ""Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.""In response to requests for comment, Apple referred to its Jan. 16 notice, where it said the injunction would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem,"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride on its platform.Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing.Last week, Apple briefly escalated the feud by blocking Epic from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe, before backing down two days later.In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law. The court also decided against hearing Apple's own appeal from the injunction.The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.

2024-03-13 16:09:53+00:00,Corporate dividends reach $1.66T in 2023: Report,"A report from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index revealed that global corporate dividends reached an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023. Notably, 86% of businesses worldwide increased or maintained their dividend payouts during the year— with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) being the world's top three dividend payers.Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills and Seana Smith break down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithMADISON MILLS: We're also going to talk about dividends because global corporate dividends hit a new high of $1.66 trillion last year, with banks making up half of that. Worldwide, 86% of listed companies either increased or maintained their dividends. That's all according to a quarterly report done by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.And it's just really interesting seeing this new record of $1.72 trillion in dividend payouts this year. This was such a big deal that it contributed to the jobs report. We saw that personal income.At least 4 percentage points of that was attributed to the rise in dividends. So it paints to this broader picture of how we're continuing to see a correlation between market performance and the strength that we're seeing in consumer spending in the overall economy.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. The strong, healthy corporate balance sheets really here front and center, and that's a big driver of the dividend action that we have seen. You mentioned, Maddie, what we were seeing globally, even here within the US. Very impressive numbers.$602.1 billion in total was handed back to shareholders last year through dividends. That was up 5%. Microsoft in the top spot here, the largest dividend payer last year, handing out more than $20 billion in cash to shareholders, followed closely by Apple. Apple was in the number two spot.But you're talking about what lies ahead here for 2024. And like you were saying, $1.72 trillion on a global basis is expected to be paid out, another 5% jump. So that also is very similar to some of the calls that we have gotten from others on the Street.S&P Global was also out predicting another record level of dividend growth in 2024 when they're looking for another 4% increase globally, 6% here within the US. So this is a trend that has been talked about over the last several quarters. But it's certainly something that we called out in this most recent quarter as a trend that we have heard many of these companies that not only are paying dividends, but also raising the amount that they are paying to shareholders. So it looks like, at least if these forecasts are right, we could be set up for another record year ahead.MADISON MILLS: Yeah. I remember being on with you a couple of months ago and you booking a guest who talked about the importance of getting in on dividend plays because at least, it's a guarantee of cash. And that's kind of a hedge against any of the macro concerns. It's also interesting looking at some of those big tech names that you mentioned.I'm fascinated that Meta isn't even in the top couple there because just Mark Zuckerberg alone is expected to make $700 million in dividends due to that dividend increase from Meta this year. So not a bad-- not a bad year of returns there.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

2024-03-13 16:00:00+00:00,4 Things Many Investors Might Not Know About Arm Holdings -- Including Certain Nvidia and Apple Ties,"Last month, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) stock rocketed 48% on the day following the chip designer's release of a strong report for its  third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Dec. 31, 2023. Management cited artificial intelligence (AI) as a main growth driver.No doubt, the mention of AI and the stock's huge price movement brought more investor attention to the U.K.-based company, which seemed to have previously been flying under the radar of many individual investors. That's likely due in part to Arm being new to the public markets -- it held its initial public offering (IPO) last September. So even many investors who closely follow the semiconductor market are probably not nearly as familiar with Arm as they are with other big chip companies.Below are four things you might not know about Arm Holdings, whose primary business is licensing its intellectual property (IP) related to the design of central processing unit (CPU) chips.Arm was founded in 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines, which was a joint venture between the now defunct Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology (some parts of which are now part of NXP Semiconductors).RISC stands for ""reduced instruction set computer,"" which Arm defines as a ""type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly optimized set of instructions rather than the highly specialized set of instructions typically found in other architectures."" The company touts that RISC is ""often considered the most efficient CPU architecture technology available today.""Arm's energy-efficient CPU architecture is widely considered one of the key drivers of the smartphone revolution, as these mobile devices need processors that don't consume a lot of power.While Apple's first iPhone, launched in 2007, wasn't the world's first smartphone -- or cellphone that had internet access -- it played a huge part in kicking off the smartphone revolution. This phone had an Arm-based processor.Currently, more than 99% of smartphones use Arm-based processors, according to the company.Arm's board of directors includes Tony Fadell. He led the team at Apple ""that created the first 18 generations of the iPod and the first three generations of the iPhone,"" according to his profile on Arm's website. Beyond leading this group, Fadell is widely credited as inventing the iPod music player.Moreover, he is a founder and former CEO of Nest, the maker of smart-home gadgets, which Alphabet -- whose corporate name was then Google -- acquired in 2014.The answer is ""yes"" if you're wondering if at least the first and early iPods had Arm-based processors. And according to various sources detailing teardowns of Nest thermostats, they also use Arm's tech. Indeed, Arm's tech is ubiquitous in smart gadgets from TVs to watches.Fadell's background is a great fit for Arm's board, which also includes others with very relevant experience, including former executives at major semiconductor companies Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm. And in Qualcomm's case, it's a former CEO, Paul Jacobs.Investors who have been following Nvidia for some time probably know that the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker tried to acquire Arm, but abandoned the pending deal in early 2022 after running into significant regulatory hurdles.However, it's not likely many investors are aware that Arm CEO Rene Haas spent seven years at Nvidia as vice president and general manager of its computing products business before joining Arm in 2013. Haas was elevated to Arm's CEO position in 2022 following the failed Nvidia deal.While Arm's global headquarters is in Cambridge, England, Haas is based out of the company's U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley. This makes good sense since the bulk of the world's largest tech companies are in this region.The fact that Nvidia was interested in buying Arm makes Arm stock worth at least watching. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is as brainy and business shrewd as they come.Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-13 15:02:45+00:00,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.Apple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.Also Read:  Top 5 Energy Stocks You May Want To Dump In MarchPhoto: ABCDstock/Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-03-13 14:21:00+00:00,Has the Sun Set on Apple's Innovation-Driven Stock?,"Once one of the strongest-growing businesses of the 21st century, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can no longer claim the title of the world's most valuable company. While second place hardly constitutes a fall from grace, investors may be wondering what the tech titan's path forward will be. In the past, Apple's annual release cycle consistently offered either new devices or significant improvements to existing products. Today, it's quite difficult to tell a 2019 Mac apart from a 2023 Mac, and even the last five iPhones have not seen any major design changes.While some product launches provided more growth than others for Apple, the general philosophy under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and design chief Jony Ive always aimed to improve the brand's perception. During Ive's 27-year career in Apple's design department, the company went from large plastic casings to precision machine aluminum. In the five years since his departure, Macbooks and iPhones alike have gotten thicker, heavier, and larger than ever before.There are now two questions to consider before investing in Apple:Has design stagnation led to apathy among consumers who once waited in line for hours to buy its newest products?Can Apple's new foray into spatial computing help the company get back to its old self, or will it become just another contender in the space?Fiscal 2023 -- which ended Sept. 30, 2023 -- saw Apple's sales markedly decrease across many products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. For each of the different devices, lower sales stemmed from unique factors. In other words, it wasn't simply a result of tightening economic conditions reducing consumer spending.For the iPhone, despite the release of the iPhone 15 models, many consumers saw very little reason to upgrade. The new phones replaced Apple's longtime Lightning connector with USB-C and added slight processing and camera improvements. The premium versions received titanium bodies. This marked the seventh year in a row in which the phone's features and form factor changed incrementally, even though the new models' prices increased.In the case of the Mac, processor upgrades did little to drive interest, and unit sales dropped by 11%. This is likely because the new Macbooks are functionally indistinguishable from the previous two years' models. Base models also still cannot support more than one monitor, which significantly limits users who need multiple screens for productivity. This has been an issue since Macbooks switched away from Intel CPUs to Apple's M-series chips.As for the iPad, 2023 marked the first year since that product's debut in which Apple did not release a new model. The result? A 15% decrease in unit sales from 2022 and insufficient marketing for the product line.Initially, Apple's business model focused on offering only the newest version of a product and discontinuing older iterations to avoid price cuts. This also meant the company could cut costs on supporting older models by decreasing the number in circulation. As of the release of the iPhone 14 series in 2022, however, Apple began offering the 13 and 12 as more affordable alternatives to the newest model. This continued in 2023 with the launch of the 15 series, with the 14 and 13 becoming the less expensive variants.Apple has also been branding even more affordable products as ""SE,"" beginning with with the iPhone SE in 2016 and followed by the Apple Watch SE four years later. With significantly more models of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, the company created its product ladder. Consumers now walk into an Apple Store expecting to buy an older model for a cheaper price but are then walked up the product ladder by seeing the incremental price and feature increases.This ultimately leads consumers to that ""Why not?"" moment, where they wonder if the $100 saved is worth having to settle for inferior features.Apple applied this strategy across most of the company's product sales and kept revenue steadily rising from 2019 to 2022 until last year's 2.8% decline.Though Apple has struggled to innovate on existing products, the launch of the new Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024 marks the company's foray into the augmented reality market. While Apple doesn't call the Vision Pro augmented reality, opting instead for ""spatial computing,"" it has a long way to go before becoming competitive in the headset market.Priced at a staggering $3,500, the headset is far out of reach for most consumers, but this is likely part of the company's ladder strategy. By introducing the Vision Pro at a high price, Apple opens up a timeline where it can release new versions, either as SE or legacy models, and slowly bring down the price over time. Whether this new product line will revolutionize personal computing and revive Apple's business growth remains to be seen.Despite revenue slipping in 2023, Apple shares rose 48% last year and nearly doubled the S&P 500's return. Unfortunately, the company's recent announcements regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been greeted with a mixed reception from investors, with some expressing low confidence in the venture.Moreover, though Apple's second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales is its software services like the App Store and Apple Music, even this golden egg isn't safe. As antitrust pressure mounts regarding the App Store and its 30% royalties for app developers, the EU Commission's $2 billion fine brings the company's longtime App Store practices into question.Now might not be the best time to buy Apple shares. I'd wait until the company's new projects in augmented reality and AI mature. Yet those currently holding Apple have no pressing reason to sell the stock, even as hardware revenue slows, because software sales can help pick up the slack. I think investors should keep a watchful eye as Apple continues to transition its business model from leaning solely on hardware products to software services and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-13 10:44:00+00:00,Apple’s Bitter Bite: Is the Tech Giant’s Slowing Growth a Cause for Concern?,"The market has shown extreme volatility for months due to inflation and recession concerns. Thus, it’s only prudent for investors to look into resilient stocks during any economic situation. One of the stocks to buy and hold that show resilience is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.Although AAPL stock saw some volatility to kick off 2024 due to weak China sales and E.U. disappointments, analysts still see value in this tech giant. However, many investors are clearly pumping the brakes on this mega-cap stock, given its slowing growth rate, and its recent lack of momentum (relative to other “Magnificent 7” stocks).Despite this, optimism remains due to Apple’s thriving services segment and recent product launches like the Vision Pro headset. Additionally, the company is shifting focus to artificial intelligence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that said, let’s dive into whether Apple’s recent performance renders the stock a sell, or if it’s one worth holding onto for the long-term.AAPL stock started 2024 off on the wrong foot, but investors remain cautiously optimistic about the stock. Apple has launched its long-awaited Vision Pro headset to mixed reviews, and its high-margin services segment is growing, though the overall trend is weak.One of the reasons for this slowing growth trend is Apple’s performance in China.China’s economic recovery post-pandemic affects Apple’s growth outlook. Citi analyst Atif Malik lowered Apple’s price target to $220, anticipating lower smartphone sales in China. He predicts a 21% decline in unit sales for the March quarter and flat total iPhone sales in 2024.Counterpoint Research data revealed a 24% decline in iPhone sales in the first six weeks of 2024, resulting in a three-percentage-point loss in market share. Analyst Atif Malik expressed concern over Huawei’s resurgence, preferred by some Chinese consumers. Increased discounts on the iPhone 15 compared to last year’s series were noted, with AAPL stock expected to remain under pressure until the June Worldwide Developers Conference.Other analysts, like those at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), have adjusted their stance on Apple recently. Despite a slight uptick on Friday, Apple’s shares faced challenges, touching their lowest point since October and declining by nearly 9% over the past month. However, analysts like Dan Ives from Wedbush maintains a positive outlook (as he has for basically forever), setting a high price target of $250 for Apple.Apple’s integration of AI across its products like iPhone, iMac, and Siri signals its commitment to technological advancement. Additionally, the recent launch of Apple Vision Pro reinforces this dedication. CEO Tim Cook’s emphasis on AI’s potential underscores Apple’s significant investment in transformative technology.Apple holds a distinct position in AI compared to leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While it’s not an under-performer, Apple’s role in AI is less dominant. Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS platform also contributes significantly to AI, unlike Apple.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) faces challenges in maintaining relevance despite efforts like “Gemini.” Currently, GOOG Stock trades at a discount due to concerns about its primary segment’s future. Apple’s valuation closely rivals Microsoft and Nvidia, showing more substantial AI growth potential.Apple’s AI role is less pronounced than Nvidia’s and Microsoft’s peers. While Apple offers strengths like brand power, investors may find more AI-driven growth in other companies. However, Apple isn’t an “AI loser” but benefits from AI trends, albeit to a lesser extent than Microsoft.Apple has given up its crown as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft, and with that, its allure among certain investors. While I’m not of the view that near-term momentum means much for those with an investing time horizon longer than five years, I do think it plays into the market’s overall narrative that Apple may underperform for some time. And until Apple shows reasonable top- and bottom-line growth, there’s a fundamental basis for this narrative.That said, it’s also true that Apple’s world class brand value and consumer loyalty are second to none. I do think this company deserves a premium valuation, but I also think valuation concerns are warranted. Both can be true at the same time.Thus, AAPL stock is a hold for me right now. Until something drastically changes to the upside or downside, this is a stock I think is too dangerous to short, and too dangerous to add to right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-13 09:50:00+00:00,This Trend Could Equal a New Billion Dollar Growth Driver for Apple.,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown revenue and profit into the billions of dollars over the years thanks to its top technology products -- from the Mac to the iPhone. And recently, the company even reached a record number of active installed devices -- more than 2.2 billion -- indicating consumers continue flocking to Apple's products.This could allow Apple to grow revenue yet another way, and this revenue source actually may become the company's next billion-dollar growth driver. The trend has already gotten started. Let's take a closer look.So, what may drive Apple's revenue moving forward? The company's services. From digital content to cloud storage, Apple offers users of its devices plenty of options. And users have signed up, helping the company grow its services revenue to record levels quarter after quarter last year.As you can see in the chart, below, Apple's services revenue has taken off over the past few years, and in the recent quarter reached a new record of more than $23 billion.This is great news because it means Apple's revenue from its devices doesn't stop once the company sells them to customers. Instead, these devices represent a source of recurrent revenue. And the fact that Apple already has an enormous installed base, and continues to increase product sales, suggests this recurrent revenue will keep on growing. On top of this, services are higher margin than products, meaning they are more profitable for the tech giant.Of course, Apple still generates most of its revenue from the sales of its market-leading products. In the latest quarter, product sales totaled more than $96 billion. But services clearly are becoming a key part of Apple's business, and one that could drive growth moving forward.All of this means investors shouldn't worry about this well-established tech company running out of steam. If you're looking for growth, Apple still represents a top long-term buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-13 07:49:14+00:00,Apple to allow web distribution for iOS apps in latest DMA tweaks,"Apple will allow iOS developers located in the European Union to distribute apps from the web, rather than from its App Store.The option, which it says will be made available to qualifying developers ""later this spring,"" is being offered in response to the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which puts obligations on how Apple can operate the App Store and iOS, which are designated as ""core platform services"" under the law.""Web Distribution, available in a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website the developer owns and operates,"" it writes. ""Apple will provide access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of developers’ apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more.""Apps offered through Apple's Web Distribution APIs will have to meet Notarization requirements it previously set out -- which it says is necessary to ""protect platform integrity."" They can also only be installed from a website domain the developer has registered with Apple, in App Store Connect.Users of iOS will also need to approve the developer installing apps from their site via their iPhone settings. They will see a ""system sheet"" -- with info developers must submit to Apple for review, including the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots and system age rating.Apple's initial proposal for DMA compliance did not allow web-based distribution for apps. However, it has faced a barrage of outrage from developers decrying a narrow and self-serving interpretation of rules that the bloc's lawmakers intend to open up digital markets locked down by the market power of a handful of intermediating internet ""gatekeepers.""The European Commission has also signaled it's closely watching Apple. It's notable that a few days after terminating the developer account of one of its most trenchant developer critics, Epic Games, Apple backed down and reinstated the account.Apple made a handful of other changes to its DMA compliance offer last week -- reducing certain criteria it had said it would apply to developers seeking to take up DMA entitlements. But today's announcements look more substantial, with Apple also dropping a restriction on alternative app marketplaces that had meant they had to offer a catalog of other developers' apps.Now -- effective immediately -- Apple says alternative app marketplaces can choose to offer only their own apps.In another change Apple has announced today -- that's also effective immediately -- it's dropping a requirement for developers that want to direct users to their own websites to purchase digital goods to use its own design templates for linking out to the web for purchases.It says this template is now optional and developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their own website.In a note to developers about the changes, Apple writes: ""We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.""The changes require developers to accept Apple's new terms -- which means signing up for a revised fee structure that includes a ""core technology"" fee, charged at €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months (regardless of where apps are distributed).Apple argues this fee reflects the value it provides developers, via ""ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users around the world,"" as it puts it.Today's changes mean qualifying iOS developers will soon be able to offer an alternative app store composed of their own wares and distributed from their own website -- something Epic Games has been anticipating -- but Apple is still applying some additional criteria, in addition to requiring developers to sign up to its new T&Cs (and pay the core tech fee).As well as requiring developers to be incorporated, domiciled, and/or registered in the EU (or have a subsidiary legal entity incorporated, domiciled, and or registered in the EU that’s listed in App Store Connect), Apple's criteria for eligibility for web distribution requires them to have been what it calls ""a member of good standing"" in its developer program for two continuous years or more and to have an app that had more than 1 million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.It also stipulates developers must agree to a range of behavioral pledges, including committing to being responsive to communications from it, especially regarding ""any fraudulent, malicious, or illegal behavior, or anything else that Apple believes impacts the safety, security, or privacy of users""; publishing transparent data collection policies and offering users control over how their data is collected and used; following applicable laws of the jurisdictions where they operate (Apple gives the examples of the EU's Digital Services Act [DSA], General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]), and consumer protection laws); and being responsible for handling governmental and other requests to take down listings of apps.Apple's explicit requirement that developers follow other EU laws looks particularly interesting in this context. The bloc's lawmakers can't exactly complain about that condition -- so it offers a route for Apple to police developers' access to web distribution for iOS apps by applying a privacy and consumer rights lens to third parties' businesses.Last year, reports suggested adtech giant Meta was planning to launch its own alternative app store on iOS and distribute apps to users in the EU via Facebook Ads, using the sideloading requirement in the DMA to bypass Apple's App Store. And while Apple's initial DMA compliance proposal looked too narrow to enable such a scenario, under the revised conditions Apple has announced today, Meta's concept of iOS apps distributed via its own ad network looks possible.However, there's one — well, several — big potential sticking point: Meta's compliance with the GDPR, DSA and EU consumer protection law are contested. Indeed, it's been found to have breached the GDPR multiple times since the law started to apply back in 2018, incurring a series of fines and corrective orders since then. Meanwhile, its current attempt to force EU users to consent to tracking is being challenged via GDPR and consumer protection complaints. The EU is also asking questions about the mechanism's compliance with the DSA, in addition to other areas of concern (like child safety).Apple may therefore have plenty of grounds it can point to to deny web distribution to Meta -- or, indeed, to any other business model that's based on consentless surveillance of users and has a long history of run-ins with EU privacy laws.Now the EU is asking questions about Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ consent modelMeta’s ‘consent or pay’ data grab in Europe faces new complaintsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/apple-to-allow-web-distribution-for-ios-apps-in-latest-dma-tweaks/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-allow-distribution-ios-apps-134458447.html

In 2023, ATRenew achieved record-breaking revenues and profits with a continuously strengthened pre-owned supply chain capability and our ongoing increase in brand recognition. Our total revenues reached RMB13 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 31.4%, significantly outpacing the growth rate of the secondhand industry and consumer sector as a whole. I would like to express my gratitude to our colleagues on the frontline and in all departments for their hard work. Our total transaction volume in 2023 was 32.3 million units. We adhere to the strategy of prioritizing self-operated business that provides better services and user experience. This focus has yielded significant results, with our [Wati] transaction volume increasing by 50% year over year in 2023. Regarding third-party platform businesses, we actively adjusted our development strategy and made efforts to develop merchant ecosystem and service capabilities. The overall platform take rate increased by 92 basis points to 5.39% in 2023. The number of registered merchants on PJT Marketplace reached 596,000, a strong growth of 46.2% compared to the previous year, which lays solid foundations for future development. 2023 was also a year of consolidation and efficiency. We further solidified our secondhand supply chain capabilities, providing more valuable services on our platforms. At the same time, we were also more disciplined at the pace of our expansion and investments in new initiatives. At the profit level, we achieved a solid non-GAAP operating profit of RMB252 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit margin of 1.9%, exceeding our target for the year. Those achievements are firmly grounded in our strategic focus. Firstly, we appear to effective customer customer acquisition scenarios on the recycling front; secondly, strengthening robust supply chain capabilities as a foundation; thirdly, driving efficiency improvements through technology; and fourthly, being agile in seizing new traffic opportunities and capturing new customer demand. Now, I will walk you through these four strategic perspectives. First, on the recycling front, we continue to successfully execute our customer acquisition strategy by leveraging our precise recycling scenarios. By the end of 2023, we have presence in 268 cities in China, reaching consumers through 1,819 AHS stores offline. We have constantly enhanced our service accessibility in high-quality business districts and communities. We further penetrated the market by combining offline stores with online platforms. Over the past year, consumer awareness and trust in our AHS Recycle brand have steadily improved, especially in big cities where recycling rates are improving. By leveraging our physical stores, freemium service reputation, and retail partners, we precisely target [using] mainstream recycling scenarios. With competitive prices and higher efficiency, we obtain high-quality sources of free on goods, fortifying the group's supply chain capability in the main business lines. In June 2023, we were pleased to announce the official collaboration with Apple for its recycling and trading services in Mainland China. Our partnership is designed to meet user demand for convenient recycling and low-cost upgrade to brand-new item products. This service is now available at the brand's official website and online flagship stores. Notably, during the fourth quarter, despite flat iPhone sales, this collaboration contributed RMB300 million to our revenues. Additionally, in terms of e-commerce partners, we have solidified our collaboration with JD's mobile and electronics retail departments, offering one-stop, single-device and multi-device trade-in services. This caters to JD's wide user base who seek more cost-effective shopping options and better recycling experiences when operating their gadgets. Overall, the growth recycling value of trade-in business on JD channels doubled in 2023. By expanding our multi-category recycling efforts, we have further strengthened appeal of our second scenario for users. The updated slogan Apple show, recycling more for you, reflects our commitment to expanding into additional categories beyond our core focus on consumer electronics. We are dedicated to fulfilling the growing demand for recycling and cash for high value -- cashback for high-value categories such as luxury goods, gold, and vintage wines. Looking ahead, we aim to expand to lower value item recycling while promoting the recycle and reuse of more idle goods. Building market cap with recycling capabilities primarily involves upgrades of family wealth, upgrading story experiences and IT systems, while fully establishing fulfillment capabilities with professional service providers. Our fulfillment strategies vary with the residual value of goods, with in-store drop-off and doorstep pickup options, users could circulate more used products with ease. By the end of 2023, we have introduced model at recycling services into 262 AHS stores. During the year, the GMV for nine electronic products at the recycling front exceeded RMB1 billion. At the same time, we bring AHS Recycle brand closer to communities and users' daily lives. Our extended presence in communities and commercial areas, coupled with an increasing density of multi-category recycling stores, encourages customers to reuse our services more often. Moving on to our supply chain processing capabilities, our highly efficient supply chain management ensures recycled goods are inspected at a lower cost while achieving accurate grading and pricing results. This allows a consistent and stable supply of goods. We have also improved our operation center's shipping and receiving capacity and enhanced their space utilization efficiency. Furthermore, our main operation centers are equipped with compliant refurbishment capabilities. The annual revenue from our self-operated compliant refurbishment business reached RMB810 million, accounting for 9.4% of the core one fewer second business segment revenue. Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the refurbishment business increased by 41.5% compared with the previous year, while the gross profit margin was 1.6 percentage point higher. This is mainly attributable to our intelligent supply chain system, which enables more accurate identification of devices suitable for refurbishment, resulting in a higher number of devices in various conditions being selected for the project. We actively participated in [taking] advantages to drive industry prosperity. In 2023, as a major drafting party, ATRenew played a key role in establishing the Electronic Product Refurbishment Industry Committee initiated by the Shenzhen Electronics Industry Association. We contributed to various group standards, including general requirement for refurbishment, labeling and information disclosure, quality management, and technical specifications. These standards serve as industry references for intellectual property protection, product data security quality, as well as user rights protection. On distribution, our advantages of an integrated B2C plus B2B platform will further magnified. In 2023, GMV of the core self-operated retail business totaled RMB2.88 billion, leveraging our supply chain strengths. Paipai has trends in its [1P2] consumer retail capabilities, meeting consumer demand for high-quality pre-owned products. To highlight, 1P2 consumer compliant refurbished product sales contributed RMB560 million in revenue. In 2023, we introduced a new consignment model to address the challenges faced by secondhand industry merchants, difficulties in operating to consumer e-commerce stores, and the struggles of small businesses. Through PJT Marketplace, we effectively connect Paipai stores with small- and medium-sized merchants, thus removing barriers that previously hindered small merchants from integrating their supply into our platform. Merchants now only need to lease their products and confirm pricing, while the platform takes care of the store operations, sales, customer services, and after-sales support. This initiative significantly lowered the entry barrier for B2C merchants, enriches the platform supply forces, and ensures a seamless purchasing experience for users. GMV for the consignment business summed up RMB70 million in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the overall business of PJT Marketplace rebounded, primarily due to a recovery in trading activities and the 35.3% year-over-year increase in the number of active merchant users. Additionally, we took the strategic decision to restructure the low commission rate spare stock business, and this reduced our costs and optimized the overall take rate of B2B platform. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, service revenues from PJT Marketplace increased by 14.9% year on year, and the overall take rate rose by 69 basis points to 6.02%. On an annual basis, its overall take rate reached 6.17%, a significant improvement of 189 basis points compared to the 2022 level. We are proud of the proven business model of PJT Marketplace, as it's an indispensable infrastructure of the industry. Looking ahead, we will further open up our supply chain advantages and become a high-quality supplier for pre-owned products in the industry. At the same time, we will provide models suitable for B2C retail and steady supply through online e-commerce platform, live streaming channels, as well as offline mobile phone retail networks and service stations. In an environment where consumers are more cautious with their expenses, ATRenew aims to leverage its competitive pricing and quality assurance of pre-owned products to foster mutual success with our partners. Firstly, in terms of technology and efficiency, we continue to promote the application of automation technology. Firstly, we have enhanced the accuracy of quality inspection. The automated quality inspection system, represented by Matrix 3.0, has reduced losses caused by quality inspection errors by 19% throughout the year. Secondly, with our focus on 1P business, we improved capacity utilization in our automated operation centers in South and East China. Thirdly, through optimizing supply chain management for receiving and delivering goods in different locations, we reduced logistics costs. As a result of these initiatives, our non-GAAP fulfillment expense as a percentage of total revenue has continued its downward trend, reaching 8.5% for the full year 2023, significantly down from 10.9% in 2022. And this underscores our dedication to achieving further cost reduction at scale. In the overseas market, we are delighted to see strong interest in our automated technology for pre-owned consumer electronics. Beyond the Mainland China market, our quality inspection technology has been successfully deployed in Hong Kong and Japan. In November 2023 -- in October 2023, we expanded our global footprint by collaborating with our European partner to bring our one-stop recycling kiosk solution to Sweden. Our one-stop solution effectively addresses the international demand for C2B recycling services. Moving forward, we remain committed to our growth trajectory and will continue to support global circulation of pre-owned products. Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year of 2024, we believe that ATRenew operates in a sustained circular economy that is impervious to economic fluctuations and technological changes. We identified several key trends in the sector. On the recycling front, we see a definite demand for convenient, high-priced, and trustworthy recycling services. On the purchasing end, we see a stronger demand for value-for-money goods from service consumers. On the fulfillment end, we see an unchanging need from secondhand merchants for efficient and hassle-free trading and logistics solutions. In late February this year, President Yi emphasized the promotion of a new round (technical difficulty) As a leading company in this field, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on this upward trend and better facilitate JD and brand owners training programs. Once again, it demonstrates that recycling and trading are encouraged by national policies as a long-term stable industry with high certainty and low policy risks. Going forward, we will adhere to our long-term core strategy and fortify our business foundations. While enhancing brand awareness for AHS Recycle, we aim to address users' fundamental pain points and collaborate with industry partners to explore the untapped potential of high-quality secondhand products. We will maintain patience in the long run while steadily releasing profits and achieving growth. Finally, I am delighted to announce an international accolade. In November 2023, ATRenew was honored as highly commended by the judging panel at the Reuters Global Business Responsibility Award in the circular transition category. This marks a milestone for ATRenew as it is the first time we have stood shoulder to shoulder with global multinational companies such as Oracle, Schneider Electric, and Pepsico. The recognition from Reuters and the expert panel is a testament to our innovation and our technological achievements. Moving forward, we will continue to deepen our commitment to the circular economy, driving sustainable industry development through technological innovation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Rex, for financial updates.Rex ChenOkay. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2023 was a year of significant achievements for our company.

Now, let's take a detailed look at our financials. Please note that all amounts are in RMB, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. In the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased by 29.9% to 3,873.6 million, driven by strong growth in net product revenues and a rebounding service revenues. Net product revenues increased by 31.1% to 3,502.5 million, while net service revenues was 351.1 million, representing an increase of 19.7%. Closing net product revenues was primarily driven by an increased U.S. sales of preowned consumer electronics through both PJT. and paper marketplaces as well as offline channels, of which sales of LinkedIn purposed devices totaled 278.2 million, which increased by 41.5% sequentially. Increasing service revenues was primarily due to the recovery of paper and the PJT. market process with the efficient online and offline customer acquisition and better execution of our take rate of our marketplaces went up 56 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.6% in the fourth quarter 2023. Now, let's discuss our operating expenses to provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operating expenses. We will also discuss our non-GAAP operating expenses, which better reflect how management views our results of operations. So reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and the corresponding Form six K furnished with the SEC. Merchandise costs increased by 32.9% to stand at 115 million. So increase was in line with the growth in product sales. Gross margin at the Group level was 18.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for our 1P business was 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Hey, Justin, you saw soft April 15th services. We implemented a proactive approach to attract customers with aggressive pricing strategies causing gross margin compression. We believe that as our market share within these channels gross So gross profit away, it will gradually return to normal levels. Fulfillment expenses increased by 9.5% to 301.1 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses, we will which we will refer to as SBC from PR. Non-gaap fulfillment expenses increased by 14% to 295.6 million, and the non-GAAP measures to increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and logistical costs as we conducted the motorcycle and the transaction certain activities year-on-year. Non-gaap fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 7.6% from 8.7%. So overall, decreasing retail fulfillment expenses reflects the impact of the economies of scale and efficiency improvements through automated operations, specifically has a number of onetime orders grow. So average fulfillment cost of product was reduced. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 46.6% to 317 million, while excluding SBC expenses and amortization and the impairment loss of goodwill and the intangible assets. Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses increased by 11 points, 11.0% to 246.6 million, primarily due to an increase in the expenses related to marketing activities. Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 6.4% from 7.5%. General and administrative expenses decreased by 18.8% to 62.2 million. Excluding SBC expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses decreased by 17.4% to 45.2 million primarily due to a decrease in headquarter profit, office expenses and fees related to professional services. Non-GAAP G&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.2% from 1.8%. Technology and content expenses increased by 17.1% to 63.8 million, excluding SBC expenses and amortization and impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets, Non-GAAP technology and content expenses increased by 52.6% to 58.3 million. So the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs in connection with the upgrades of the complex operating center and the systems. Non-gaap technology and content expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.5% from 1.3%. As a result, our non-GAAP operating income was 81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 23, representing a significant increase of 135.8% year-on-year. Non-gaap operating profit margin was 2.1% compared to 1.2% in 4Q 2022. To provide some context regarding our balance sheet our inventories amounted to 1 billion as at the end of the fourth quarter of 20 industry, representing a sequential increase of EUR344.8 million compared to we see end of the third quarter of 20, the industry. This increase was primarily due to a surge in recycling volume generated from Apple's official trading program. However, that had a limited impact on our operating cash flow since we have our payment term of 45 days and effectively managing relevant payables through bank guarantees. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and funds receivable from sort of partly payment of service providers totaled 2.9 billion. Our strong cash position safeguards our company's history, we will put we repurchased of four 4.5 million ADSs in the open market for a total consideration of USD8.1 million at December 31st contains three.

I mean, if you step back and essentially Sundar permit on that. Well, thank you for your question. During 2022 and 2023, we saw a shift in consumer behavior. Our users' focus transition from consumption upgrades to emphasize on value for money during this transformation, we noticed a shift right fleet, the right user demand for trillions and recycling in exchange for cash. As we mentioned, our 1Q revenue grew 34.4% year-over-year in 2023 was trade is still clearly more than doubling compared to the previous year. We will continue to drive the core growth flywheel of 1T Rocephin business and to extend our industrial operating profit margin further by bringing our operational efficiency to the next level, we are steadfast in investing in the brand of interest to recycle to unleash growth of traffic and economy of scale. Further, in terms of our platform business, we've strengthened the synergies between TJC. marketplace and other marketplaces that and provide a small merchants with upgraded consignments services. This helped us build a more robust to supply and meant we could offer a more diverse selection of high-quality secondhand products to our users and looking ahead to 21 for workplace user experience as our top priority and while providing the utmost support to the restocking and trading offerings of JD.com and Apple's official training program. We believe that the support from the central government for large scale trading policies and consumer goods will benefit our collaborations with JD and brand partner together, we elevate consumer awareness of trading and cost ratio has been made during consumption twice. Because of this.Joyce JuWe are confident in achieving a 30% year-over-year revenue growth for our OneTEAM business, why you thought in the equally so on the US and in Toby, Nadir, so you got more agents helpful at CONMED.

We set a model take rate for this business segment in 2003, we trust there is ample growth potential in the take rate in 2024, our focus is enhancing user awareness of a transfer cycle as the leading national recycling brands, our core strategy is to fail to build an even better user experience. To achieve this, we will provide more structured products into our platform and improve our pricing capabilities. This will drive more recycling transactions across a wider range of categories.OperatorJunyun Chen, CITIC.Junyun ChenThank you, Kim, and thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good results. I have two questions. First, could you provide more color on the higher than expected profitability this year? And what's your profitability target for 2024 and for the medium to long term? And second in late 2023 and already 2020 for the iPhone 15 series of face some challenges from Huawei. How does management view the challenging commodity landscape, a more optimal biopharma manufacturers? And how did your Apollo trading business performed in Q4 2023? And what are your scale and profit targets for 2024?Xuefeng ChenThanks to our very own joint venture into cancer going tangential, Akiva goes to constitute a degree or two below tied to that yet, will that Lynch the differentiation of 19,000 tons to Teradata as Danielle, you entitled to any of the different science to address us from you if you don't have to constantly review the GE crush at semaglutide and you haven't seen a change going forward on our own to the iPhone short-selling attack or amateur Trulia 20 Jasmine tornado milling unit to show you how it began. Glad to have one-time Google to come back in financial challenges and are going to be our peak quarter to one point. Joe, quick question on your sensitivity to gas in some. Yes, RCM growth, any growth going or will you move down? Sorry. Okay. Thank you. So I will take your first question and I carry out your with the kiosk. Second, the questions. Okay. So for our first submission in 2023, we once again achieved breakthroughs in terms of cost efficiencies. And then in capital measures, fulfillment, selling and marketing, G&A and other administrative and technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenues for 8.5%, 7.3% and 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. These figures correspond to a year-over-year decrease of 2.4% to 1.6% and 0.1% and 0.6% respectively. In terms of fulfillment, we achieved a remarkable efficiency improvement, our efficient system of production to offer incentives and a centralized self-operated operation stations have further improve our inspection quality and cost conscious skewing effect created by the use of automation. Technology at shopping centers has also had a positive impact. We are now seeing lower costs related to sourcing quoting, especially in the warehouse when compared to our previous approach of using decentralized jointly operated stations, we have also leveraged data to optimize small items deleverage with low cost of ownership. This has driven down shipping and receiving costs of all our operations center expenses in logistics costs decreased by 9% and 8%, respectively. During 2023. This resulted in Yunnan CapEx limited expense of 1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of around 2%. Our total net GAAP selling and marketing expenses in the travel industry was 940 million. This was a year-over-year increase of 7.8%. Also a lot lower than all our revenue growth rate over the same period this was mainly driven by HR efficiency improvements from deploying advanced digital CRM tools of the P2P sales team. The results was a 19% cost reduction compared to the pervious year 1423, Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, 190 million, a year-over-year increase of 21.9%. This was mainly due to office grant and various other administrative costs, including employee travel, training and benefits. Our Non-GAAP technology and content expenses were 170 million in 2023, thanks to the gradual maturation of our platforms at a margin. That's our official launch of our South China automation of incentive. We did not see significant cost growth in this category. In addition, as I call them, maturation initiative we launched in 2022 was completed in 2023. This contributed to an overall decrease in technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenue, representing an improvement in scaling effects. So Brooks, some breakdown above highlights the enhancements satellite to the increasing our non-GAAP operating profit in terms of industry for path to profitability growth, our primary focus of our 1P, gross margin and operating efficiency. Our long-term goal is to improve our non-GAAP operating profit margin by 1% every year. In terms of our 1P business, we have prioritized ability to control first hand supply while also enhancing user awareness of our C2B Brent, a virtuous cycle. We saw the first hand suppliers with competitor. We're recycling prices. Meanwhile, we continue to unleash our self-operated and refurbishment businesses. While we diversify the standard of supply to pipeline, we expect a larger proportion of 2C sales as we seek a higher profit margin of 1P revenue. I'd like I'd also like to add more color on our corporate collaboration with Apple. In the fourth quarter, our Apple business achieved sales of 300 million. However, as this business is relatively new and is still being defined as gross profit margins below an ideal level. Going forward, we plan to optimize our pricing mechanism to strike a balance between profitability and growth. In terms of operating efficiency, we are constantly optimizing our full cost to revenue ratios. Our automation capabilities will continue to improve our fulfillment efficiency, especially cost per device was diluted due to an increase in ASPD. In terms of selling and marketing, we tried to maximize the effectiveness of our B2B sales team. At the same time, we plan to strategically leverage social media traffic to attract customers. So probable reserves and location. Data service capabilities of short video platforms such as Boeing, will help us target potential users with greater accuracy. This approach has the added benefit to further strengthen our sourcing demographics and the market position. We recognize that the key to building a successful second hand opinions also lies in our ability to acquire supplies through brand at par. As such, our agents through a cycle brand is pivotal to our long-term driver with government passed at this at this stage, we believe strategically allocating appropriate put the soft resources to social media traffic will solidify our long-term competitive position in this dynamic market.Joyce JuOkay, of Dazzle, and he will elaborate on a pink or the tone cautious on? Well, what you see in other cities such as etsy.com once again, the anomalies of a deal by deal using Yoshida and Okay. So the decency to Shin Ji, the claim of one to four year warrant portfolio was either with our budget. Omega is social media for them.

So that's how we want to push you up taking or plan for you towards the end of the year for you. So sorry, GBM, Central Europe and quite a male in backup center hockey concern, Jacada key measures.Xuefeng ChenI will answer the second question, we have systematically roll down our recycling and trading services on behalf of official website. And that 47 flagship stores for service and pricing were highly commended by users. On social media spontaneously. In terms of scale, we have secured a significant amount of first densify by leveraging the substantial volume of new items shipments in the fourth quarter and by maintaining competitive research and pricing services contributed RMB300 million in product sales revenue during the fourth quarter. This was not this was a meaningful increase compared to the third quarter our suddenly volume is greater than our sales volume. This crude, that user acceptance of ethanol trading for new products is increasing and there is still much room for improvement in the penetration rate of trading products. We will maintain flexible adjustments to our pricing strategy based on market feedback to optimize our gross profit margin. Importantly, we do not handle front-end fulfillment and marketing for the Apple business. As a result, even though this business segment has a narrow gross profit margin, it has the potential to contribute a relatively higher operating profit margin.Joyce JuOkay.OperatorDue to the time limit on the call, I'd like to hand the conference back to management for closing remarks.Jeremy JiThank you all again for joining us today, and a replay of today's call will be available on our IR website, shortly followed by a transcript.

Apple closed 0.3% lower, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.886 trillion.""It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said at the time, according to Reuters.The two tech titans have jostled for top spot over the years and Microsoft was ahead at last check, with a market cap of $3.085 trillion, compared with Apple's value of $2.684 trillion.Analysts noted that Apple had been dealing with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, the company’s main source of revenue.Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and competition from Huawei.Sales in China of Apple's iPhone fell by 24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared with a year earlier, according to research firm Counterpoint, as the company contended with stiff competition from a resurgent Huawei ""while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi,"" said senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang.“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,"" he said.Future Publishing/Getty ImagesCounterpoint said that the first six weeks of 2023 saw abnormally high numbers with significant unit sales being deferred from December 2022 due to production issues.Apple is planning to open its eighth store in Shanghai – and its 47th across China – on March 21.Related: Tech News Now: OpenAI says Musk contract 'never existed', Xiaomi's EV, and moreThe company also plans to expand its research centre in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and open a new lab in southern tech hub Shenzhen later this year, according to the South China Morning Post.Meanwhile, over in Europe, Apple announced changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect last week, Reuters reported on March 12.Beginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.""To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later,"" Apple said on its website, referring to the software platform that runs iPhones and iPads.""Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,"" the company said.Apple has also said it will appeal a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting competition from Spotify  (SPOT)  and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.The company's shares have suffered amid all this upheaval, but some analysts still see good things in Apple's future.Bank of America Securities confirmed its positive stance on Apple, maintaining a buy rating with a steady price target of $225, according to Investing.com.The firm's analysis highlighted Apple's pricing strategy evolution since the introduction of the first iPhone in 2007, with initial prices set at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model.BofA said that Apple has consistently launched new iPhone models, including the Pro/Pro Max versions, to target the premium market.Concurrently, prices for previous models are typically reduced by about $100 with each new release.This strategy, coupled with installment plans from Apple and carriers, has contributed to the iPhone's installed base reaching a record 1.2 billion in 2023, the firm said.More Tech Stocks:Analyst unveils new Facebook stock price target after earningsBillionaire George Soros sold this popular semiconductor stockArk’s Cathie Wood just traded 3 popular tech stocksApple has effectively shifted its sales mix toward higher-value units despite experiencing slower unit sales, BofA said.This trend is expected to persist and could help mitigate potential unit sales weaknesses, particularly in China.BofA also noted Apple's dominance in the high-end market, maintaining a market share of over 90% in the $1,000 and above price band for the past three years.The firm also cited the anticipation of a multi-year iPhone cycle propelled by next-generation AI technology, robust services growth, and the potential for margin expansion.On Monday, Evercore ISI analysts said they believed that the sell-off in the iPhone maker’s shares may be “overdone.”The firm said that investors' growing preference for AI-focused stocks like Nvidia  (NVDA)  has led to a reallocation of funds away from Apple.In addition, Evercore said concerns over weakening demand in China, where Apple may be losing market share in the smartphone segment, have affected investor sentiment.And then ongoing regulatory issues continue to have an impact on investor confidence in the world's second-biggest company.“We think the sell-off is rather overdone, while we suspect there is strong valuation support at current levels to down 10%, there are three distinct drivers that could unlock upside on the stock from here – a) Cap allocation, b) AI inferencing, and c) Risk-off/defensive shift,"" the firm said in a research note.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",Yahoo

2024-03-12 21:26:16+00:00,"Investor patience, Mag 7 shakeup, Fed dot plot: Market takeaways","Yahoo Finance Head of News Myles Udland joined the Live Show to share his top three market takeaways for the day.""Trust the process,"" Udland advises investors, despite the uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts. Udland points to the continued tech rally and market capital gains as sources of optimism.As heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) experience significant declines, lagging behind other ""Magnificent Seven"" names, Udland identifies Eli Lilly (LLY) and Costco (COST) as potential contenders to replace these stocks. Costco, he highlights, continues to benefit from the premiumization of consumer habits.Udland also stresses the significance of next Wednesday's dot plot release from the Federal Reserve, dubbing it ""the most important dot plot ever."" He explains that current market reactions are based on the expectation of three rate cuts by the Fed. However, this pivotal dot plot will either validate or refute those predictions, shaping market dynamics moving forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: Myles, what are your top takeaways?MYLES UDLAND: You guys were just talking about the first one, which is if you look at the print we got on CPI this morning, and then the reaction we got in the market to continue these sports adjacent theme, I guess, of this program. Trust the process as some of our viewers might remember.And I think that investors right now are essentially continuing to believe, I guess, for themselves, I guess, for their clients just for the general 2024 story, which is that the Fed will cut rates, and it will end up being fine. And a lot of what worked in '23 will work in '24. Well, that continues to play out.And I think you see that really in the sector action with technology doing all of the work today. And the market cap gains that we've seen over the course of this year, obviously, make the skew there, let's say, on a sector basis even more important for the index level move.JULIE HYMAN: All right, I'm curious about the second takeaway there with the real Magnificent Seven.JARED BLIKRE: Here we go. This is a fun part.MYLES UDLAND: All right, so Jared and I were talking about this a little bit earlier. And he crunched the numbers. So we have a little divergence within real Mag Seven.But I think over the last few weeks, we have all circled this idea that Apple and Tesla are kind of out. Like they have been laggards. I mean, Tesla is down for the year.They have been laggards relative to the guys in the Magnificent Seven doing a lot of the work, which is really NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Meta at this point. So I am proposing two new entrants to the Magnificent Seven. Eli Lilly, which is now I think what the eighth biggest company in the S&P, something like this.Bank of America's note last week at $1,000 bucks a share. Had it basically at $1 trillion market cap, about $950 billion.And the second is Costco. Now, Costco is I think 22nd right now in the S&P 500 on a market cap basis. But the reaction that we saw on Costco last week to that revenue miss which was a small revenue miss.I think stock was down 7% to 8% in a day. And that was a day where all the 2024 trades cooled off. And Costco has been at the center of like, don't worry, just buy it at 50 times earnings.It's fine. Everyone loves Costco. And it has taken on like mega caps are now, I don't want to say meme stocks. But there's a meme of like just buy this mega cap theme.Costco continues to benefit from this premiumization, I guess, of consumer habits. And it's just a safe place that you can put money, and you can tell someone we're now overweight Costco. And everyone that is your investors can be like, that's great. I love Costco.JARED BLIKRE: I love how you're stuffing a consumer staple in the Magnificent Seven.MYLES UDLAND: It doesn't act like a staple. Look at the stock.JULIE HYMAN: It just feels wrong to me to have Costco in there with those other companies.MYLES UDLAND: So I was looking at this. I think there's also a discussion to be had about where Alphabet fits within the Magnificent Seven. I know the Magnificent Three is kind of where it's at.JARED BLIKRE: It's flat on the year. So where does it go? Yeah. I don't know. I will say this.When I was crunching the numbers, looking at the disparity between the old Mag Seven, the new one with Costco, and Lilly, it makes a difference. Going back to our chart, if you go back to the beginning of 2020, the Mag Seven original is up 155%.If you switch Costco and Eli Lilly, and it's up 171%. 171. But the mag 4 is at 187%. So it just goes to show you we don't need Costco, we don't need Eli Lilly. We need more concentration.We need the Mag One. And maybe that's it. And that's where you go. That's how you take this to its illogical extreme conclusion in case you were wondering.MYLES UDLAND: Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: The last takeaway that I should mention here is the last point on your screen, which was the most important dot plot ever. Is that since the last dot plot, or are you being-- Are you not being-- wait-- are you, Myles Udland, not being facetious?MYLES UDLAND: I think next Wednesday's dot plot is the most important dot plot the Fed has ever released. And the reason why is that when they came out in December, and they said we're going to cut rates three times in 2024, the market said, all right, we'll buy that. We think it's going to be 6.And over the last few months, there's been a convergence. The market is now at 3 to match the Fed. In that time, the S&P is up 7% or 8%. We're just talking about all the action in the Magnificent Seven for, however, many stocks.All those memes are still in play. Now, you're getting softwares rallying. Chinese tech stocks. Like everything's great in the market.On the condition that the markets still believe the Fed will cut rates three times. If they come out next week, and they say we're going to cut rates once, I think you are then having a conversation about, are we getting to the June dot plot and discussing rate hikes or no cuts this year?And I think a lot of what the market has become comfortable with in the last few weeks is that this is delayed gratification, not removed reward essentially. And if the Fed comes out and suggests that there's a wholesale change in how they're approaching rate cuts in 2024, then you could be like, all right, maybe we've got a problem here.JULIE HYMAN: Just one quick note on that, too, that I think is interesting. Jay Powell really downplayed the dot plot at certain times in the past. But it feels like maybe that was the wrong call because it turns out the dot plot actually was the more accurate read.MYLES UDLAND: And if you look at his testimony last week, he did the same thing. He's trying to downplay it. And I think the reason he's trying to downplay it is because he knows that it has only risen in importance.Like the thing is if you look at '23, the Fed's dot plot told you they were going to be more aggressive, told you they were not looking to cut rates. And while he wants to back away from that, it has been a pretty good guide in the last couple of years.So what they say next week, markets correctly will probably infer. It's going to be a guide for what happens in balance of this year.JARED BLIKRE: I like your thinking. We had some fun earlier. But that's some serious deep dive thinking that--MYLES UDLAND: I know the whole thing is like I'm always kidding. And I don't mean it. But like, I actually think some--JARED BLIKRE: This is how you got to head of news.MYLES UDLAND: For whatever that is. I mean, is that title serious? I don't know.JULIE HYMAN: Yes.JARED BLIKRE: All right, thank you, Myles.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/investor-patience-mag-7-shakeup-212616701.html

Yahoo Finance Live comments on BofA's new earnings forecasts and the role AI and Magnificent Seven tech stocks have played in pushing the S&P higher.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.- Time now to dig a little deeper into some analyst calls of the day, starting with Bank of America raising its 2024 earnings per share. That's EPS target for the S&P 500. Citing a virtuous cycle in AI investment paired with a new labor productivity, they raised their EPS target by 12% for the year end to $250. And Julie, they are now a Street high. And they're touting that in their own report. They're happy to be there. I would say Savita Subramanian and the other teams there, they've been ahead of the pack. They were quite right last year early on when a lot of other analysts were negative. But they've come around, and now this earnings per share that puts them at $250 for this year, $275 for next.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And I think it's so interesting that AI has gone from being a specific company story, or even a sector story to really more of a macro story. Right? I mean, because they talk about that quote unquote, ""virtuous investment cycle."" They talk about new economy investing as the old economy cuts back. And this is according to Bank of America a flip of last year when we saw the so-called hyperscalers, the companies like Microsoft and Amazon and Alphabet, that were cutting back while the rest of the S&P 500 was investing. Now you've seen a flip of that situation. But obviously, the team over there sees this as enough to boost that EPS number.- Well, and for all the talk about share buybacks and dividends, we can also-- investors can also get a return on their capital through capital investments or capital expenditures. And this is-- here's another line from the report. Hyperscalers, this includes Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, expected to spend $180 billion on capital expenditures this year. That's up 27%.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.- So just an amazingly high number that's going into the future basically.JULIE HYMAN: And then on the old economy side just one more quick note, they also say they see a manufacturing upgrade and perhaps a restocking cycle. Right? Because you had over inventory.- We've been in a manufacturing recession.JULIE HYMAN: Right. And then you just had an inventory correction, and now I guess the correction to the correction would be that restocking taking place.- Correction to the correction is up, guys.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.[CHUCKLES]Exactly.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/bank-america-boosts-p-500-200224272.html

2024-03-12 18:00:11+00:00,"'We Don't Want To Think About Apple Being Evil,' Says Y Combinator Founder Paul Graham After Tech Giant Terminates Epic Games Developer Account Over Founder's Critical Tweets","Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.For example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store.  If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.Don't Miss:WealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.New homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market – and it sells for $5 per share.In 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.Trending:Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.The legal battle has continued on several fronts. The European Union recently passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to help level the playing field for people like Epic against Apple. Epic planned to launch a competitor to the App Store, which resulted in Epic Games's developer account being banned. After some challenges under the DMA from the EU, Apple reinstated the account shortly after.While this led to Sweeney touting the battle as ""victory"" on X, it led Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham to comment with a larger question: Is Apple evil?Graham's post stated, ""Apple just terminated Epic’s developer account, and they admitted that this tweet was one of the reasons. We don’t want to think about Apple being evil. It would be so inconvenient. We don’t want to switch to Android. But I see ever more signs that power has corrupted them.""The post in question was from Sweeney stating:Apple leadership faces some massive decisions in the coming weeks as the contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies are reckoned with: the app store monopoly, the digital goods payments monopoly, the tax, the suppression of true information about competing purchasing options, the blocking of competing web browser engines and outright destruction of web apps. It doesn't have to be this way. Apple is a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers and overlord to none.""Many find it concerning that, despite the massive resources Epic Games has at its disposal Apple is still able to assert incredible control over the multibillion-dollar corporation.While corporations increasingly aren't fond of Apple, consumers love the brand.

2024-03-12 16:52:00+00:00,The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans,"For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?While I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.In this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Top DogsAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.We can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.Nvidia: The Undisputed King of AINvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.This dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.Nvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon: Multifaceted Technology EnterpriseAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.Meta Platforms: Always UnderestimatedDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.Under CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.Meta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.Meta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.Microsoft: On the CuspMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.One major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.Microsoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.Something worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.Image Source: TradingViewApple, Alphabet and TeslaThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.Apple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.This seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.As AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.Alphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.Additionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.Alphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry.Image Source: TradingViewSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.Or course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.While major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.Until this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.However, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions.

2024-03-12 16:10:01+00:00,How Apple can exit a slump: Analyst,"Three of the Magnificent Seven –– Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA) –– are lagging behind the other four. Apple is the second largest laggard, down 10% year to date. The company has seen four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, weakness in Chinese markets, a hefty EU fine, and a major patent dispute. Analysts have taken note of the tech giant's challenges, with several firms downgrading the stocks or removing them from their buy lists.Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's performance and her optimism about a turnaround.Martin points to Apple's installed base of two billion devices: ""What they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices...Maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth, its a $600 billion a year business and they do $2 billion a year in it. They need to add advertising to get growth back and also advertising has 80% profit margins. They need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Well, three of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks are taking hits so far this year. Shares of Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla are in the red this week. And we are focusing on those three laggards and what it's going to take for some of that momentum to turn.Today, we're talking Apple. Shares are down about 10% since the start of the year. Apple came into the year with some worrisome trends. Four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, with weakness in China weighing on those results. Apple, also facing a legal battle over the blood oxygen sensor in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watch models. Analysts were quick to pick up on the growing problem.Piper Sandler, Barclays, and Redburn Atlantic, all downgrading the stock in the first couple of weeks of the year. Goldman Sachs, removing Apple from its conviction buy list in March. A slew of negative headlines and data has also contributed to the stock's declines this year.From the blood oxygen patent dispute to the company's disappointing Q1 results and guidance, to the reported cancelation of the company's 10-year-old EV project, and a hefty fine from the EU over Apple's App Store practices. Most recently, a Counterpoint Research report showing that China's smartphone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of the year compared to a year ago.So what is it going to take for Apple to turn things around? We want to bring in Laura Martin, Needham senior media and internet analyst. Laura, quite the setup for you. We have laid out what Apple has been looking at over the last several months. What is it going to take, and do you think Apple is going to turn things around?LAURA MARTIN: You know, I do. The most valuable asset they have is an installed base of two billion devices and about a billion and a half unique users worldwide, which because of their enormous price premium on their products, really it's the richest people on Earth. And that's sort of their, I'm going to call it monopoly in an oligopoly industry structure between them and Android.So what they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices. And, like you say, maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth. It's a $600 billion a year business, and they do $2 billion a year in it. So they need to add advertising to get growth back. And also advertising has 80% profit margins, so.And they need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device. But what they have is two billion active devices, daily active devices, which is a really wonderful installed base.BRAD SMITH: And so for the management and how they're going to be able to navigate this year with pulling some of the levers that you just mentioned a moment ago, or at least leaning into some of those opportunities here.There's a lot of focus around the lighter fluid that generative AI could be to smartphone demand and the products in the future. When could that actually be realized for companies like Apple, or even on the other side of that, on an OS perspective, Android products?LAURA MARTIN: Right. So I expect Apple to continue to lag the generative AI companies. So what I think is happening in America is Google, Amazon OpenAI are creating a new basis of competition for all of American business. And Nvidia is the arms dealer in the chips for all of those. So that opportunity of gen AI is unique to a dozen companies. And those will continue to outperform Apple.Apple doesn't have the-- it operates in the smartphone ecosystem, which is a single industry. So that's what it's defending. So it can-- it's going to be limited, in my opinion, to just doing a better job in its wheelhouse, in its barn.Meanwhile, there's a maelstrom going on outside of that, that's a bigger opportunity. So I think Apple continues to outperform the S&P, but it doesn't continue to outperform these companies that are going to redefine competition in America.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-exit-slump-analyst-161001176.html

Why Analysts Are Counting On a Comeback.","Despite the hit Apple stock has taken this year, Wall Street says now is the time to buy shares of the iPhone maker, citing coming catalysts that could incite a rebound. Apple shares have dropped 10% this year, lagging behind other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of stocks and the broader market.

2024-03-12 15:24:07+00:00,Apple's stock is in the red for 2024: What the charts show,"Apple (AAPL) has lost more than $300 billion in market cap so far in 2024. It's one of the three Magnificent Seven laggards, a list that also includes Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The company hasn't been able to capitalize on AI the way other group members have and there are growing concerns about iPhone sales in China.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre takes a closer look at Apple's charts to see what may lie ahead for the stock.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: The Magnificent Seven in focus this week as we see multiple members trading in the red. AI darling NVIDIA has logged two straight days of losses. Overall, still outperforming, though. And it's up here over the past five days by about 5%, and year-to-date, you're seeing it up as well. But three of the seven Mag Seven stocks are not outperforming. Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla all seeing losses since the start of 2024. Shares of Apple off 10%. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi there. I thought this heat map here of our megacaps kind of encapsulates what we've seen this year. Apple in the red while most of the other things in the green, and Tesla down 1%. And let me show the year-to-date totals where you can see, as you just said, Apple down 10%, Tesla down 29%. Of the Mag Seven, it is the worst off. But then there's Nvidia up 80% really just outshining them all.And here's another way of looking at it. If we look at the market cap gains this year, Nvidia up almost a cool trillion dollars. It was closer to that mark a couple of days ago, but it is roaring back to it. Then you have Meta, Amazon each up more than $200 billion. Microsoft, too, thrown in that category. Then you start getting into the underperformers.Alphabet just slightly down. Tesla, although it's worse down percentagewise, only down the second worst down $224 billion. And then Apple down $327 billion. And I'll do some technical analysis on Apple chart because it is just getting back to a really interesting area. Let me put a three-month chart on. And actually, let me put a one-year chart on. And we can see what could be an M top. It's a little bit hard to see on this time frame. But as I zoom out to a three-year it'll come back in focus.And here we go, M right there. Now, if this neckline is violated, probably heading down to test a lower support area, 150 that big round number that could be one. And then below that, I got 125 to 130. And that would take it down to the place where it was exactly three years ago, so unchanged. Apple, as they say, so goes Apple, so goes the rest of the market. Not this year. Really hasn't been able to capitalize on that AI train.And you can really see this when we take a look at NVIDIA versus Apple all by itself. Here is year-to-date. Apple down 10%. NVIDIA up 80%. But over the last three years, NVIDIA just a much more high beta play. I don't know if it's fair to compare these two together, but there you go, Apple and Nvidia.And I will leave you with this because we've been talking about the race between Tesla and some of the other market cap leaders. Visa just passed Tesla, by the way. But check out what's happening with Apple and Nvidia.

2024-03-12 15:00:13+00:00,Buffett's Winning Trio: Unveiling The 3 Stocks Driving His Remarkable Returns,"Warren Buffett's investment strategies are widely coveted by investors globally, as the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio has delivered a robust 9.85% compounded annual return over the past 30 years. While Buffett has amassed a majority of his wealth through diversified businesses, his stock investments have also generated billions in passive income alone.Buffett has long advocated long-term investment strategies in established blue chip companies and has typically condoned avoiding taking immense risks.""One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been — and will be — rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes,"" Buffett stated in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s annual shareholder letter.Some of Buffett's profitable investment bets have been in large-cap dividend-paying stocks.Buffett describes his stake in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) as his ""secret sauce,"" as the company's immense dividend payouts account for a sizable portion of Berkshire's earnings.Buffett acquired his stake in American Express for $1.3 billion in 1995, but its annual earnings in 2023 ""considerably exceeded"" the cost of purchase. In addition, his total stake in American Express was valued at roughly $22 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022.Buffett's investment in American Express accounts for 4% to 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net worth, while the total dividend earnings from the stake amounted to nearly $302 million in fiscal 2022. The investment guru predicts American Express's dividend payouts to increase by 16% in 2024.While Buffett did not purchase or sell any shares of American Express in 2023, his ownership stake in the company rose marginally because of Berkshire's share repurchases.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here are three high-yield investments that could add significant income to your portfolio.The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) is another one of Buffett's hidden gems, as its dividend payouts make a sizable paycheck for one of the world's richest men. Buffett invested a total of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola in 1994 and cashed in $704 million in dividends annually by 2022.""Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays,"" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter. ""We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.""In addition, Berkshire Hathaway's total stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion, reflecting an over 1,800% capital appreciation.Buffett claimed that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is ""a better business than anything we own."" He had a 5.9% stake in Apple as of Dec. 31, 2023, making it one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. The Magnificent Seven stock has grown by over 365% since the end of 2018, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500's returns.However, Buffett sold nearly 1% of his stake in Apple in the last quarter of 2023. While concerns regarding Apple's operational challenges have caused the stock to plummet by more than 12% so far this year, analysts remain bullish regarding the tech giant's long-term growth prospects.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250, reflecting a potential upside of nearly 50%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Samik Chatterjee maintains a similar Overweight rating on Apple, with a price target of $215, indicating a potential upside of over 27%.Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles. Here’s how to join him in his latest venture with as little as $100.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a lot simpler.

2024-03-12 14:29:12+00:00,Apple will allow direct app downloads from developers in Europe,"Apple (AAPL) will begin to allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites in Europe, falling in line with European Union (EU) regulations.Yahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down the latest development for Apple and what it could mean for the company moving forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Apple shares ticking slightly lower this morning, off just about 7/10ths of a percent after the company announced that it will allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites. Now this is a part of the changes that are required by new EU rules. Now this will only be available for users in the EU. But this is really, broadly speaking, a part of that overhaul that we have been talking about now for quite some time. It's going to permit third-party marketplaces to offer their own developed apps. And we bring this up because of the impact that this could potentially have on Apple's bottom line, at least in the EU here over the coming quarters, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, that's right. And they said in a blog post as well here they're going to be providing more of that flexibility for developers distributing apps in the European Union, including that new way to distribute apps directly from the developer's website, as you mentioned. They also added here that the developers are going to get access to APIs, those-- those application programming interfaces that help with the distribution of their apps from web integrate with system functionality, backup, and restore users apps, and much more, the company is saying here. So this is a significant move, really prompted by, I would say kind of two major cases that move forward. One of them, of course, being Epic Games.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then another one-- And what Spotify was really pushing back on with Apple. And so all of this placed even more of a spotlight on the fees that Apple gets from this, up to 30%.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then additionally-- 30% of the revenues, I should say. And then additionally here, the number of users data that they have access to that they eventually are able to kind of block off or, you know, institute more of their privacy mechanisms to make sure that the people who are actually developing the app are not getting as much access to that as well. Yet Apple is able to retain and advertise on top of that, even more so.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you're exactly right there. And then also just putting this in perspective for investors out there who are looking at Apple and just saying what this could mean for the company going forward, Apple gets about a quarter of its revenue from Europe. It makes that it's the second biggest revenue driver here for the company in fiscal 2023. It makes up 42%. And its revenue come from the Americas, 25% from Europe, followed by just about 19% from Greater China.So we have talked time and time again about the issues that they are having within China, the fact that iPhone demand seems to be slumping. Uhh, at least it has been in recent quarters and then since the start of the year. So another potential issue here, uh, is important for investors to keep in mind when it comes to the European business.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-allow-direct-app-downloads-142912702.html
2024-03-12 12:30:00+00:00,Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $364 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock,"Given his wide recognition as one of the world's greatest capital allocators, it's no surprise that individual investors love to look at Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's gigantic $364 billion portfolio for stock ideas.Among the top holdings is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up a whopping 43% of the entire portfolio. The Oracle of Omaha first purchased this FAANG stock in early 2016, and since the start of that year to March 8, it has skyrocketed 375%. This is undoubtedly one of Buffett's most lucrative bets.Investors can gain insights by figuring out the factors that led to Apple's prominent place in Berkshire's portfolio.While we can't read Buffett's mind, we know that he appreciates high-quality businesses first and foremost. Apple certainly fit the bill in 2016.A key part of its economic moat is the powerful brand. Apple is a technological and cultural icon, thanks to its incredibly popular hardware devices, the most notable of which is the iPhone. This single product generated $201 billion of sales in fiscal 2023.Look through Berkshire's top holdings, and it's obvious he appreciates strong brands. Coca-Cola and American Express are two large positions whose brands resonate mightily with consumers.Apple's brand holds so much weight that it allows the business to flex its pricing power, another trait Buffett likes to see. People have no problem paying up for expensive products, often just to upgrade to the latest version. Add on Apple's growing services offerings, and the company is able to keep its users engaged and loyal.In fiscal 2015, the year before Buffett scooped up the stock for the first time, Apple reported a gross margin of 39% and an operating margin of 30%. This was and still is a ridiculously profitable enterprise, generating $81 billion of operating cash flow that year.Sound financial performance is something the Oracle of Omaha wants from his businesses. Apple's pristine balance sheet also reduces the risk that the company will ever run into money troubles. That probably explains why Buffett was so comfortable letting the Apple holding become such a huge position in the portfolio.We can't ignore valuation as a critical factor. During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10.6. Investors were worried about something that caused such a depressed valuation. But based on all of its impressive qualities, it was clear that the market got it wrong. With the benefit of hindsight, adding Apple to Berkshire's portfolio eight years ago looked like a no-brainer decision for Buffett.Apple has been a fantastic investment. And because Berkshire still owns a sizable stake, investors probably want to buy the stock right now.But because the shares have performed so extraordinarily well, they aren't cheap anymore. In fact, I believe they are now overvalued. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 26.6 today. That's much higher than what Buffett paid in 2016.If Apple was staring at tremendous growth opportunities in the years ahead, then maybe one could justify paying that steep of a valuation. However, I don't think that's the case anymore. This is a very mature company. Revenue declined 2.8% in fiscal 2023. And Wall Street analysts believe sales will increase at an annual pace of just 4.2% during the next three years.Apple is one of the world's most outstanding businesses. No one will argue with that. But it's no longer a solid investment candidate.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

The law targets the dominance of platforms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s App Store, Amazon.com Inc.’s marketplace and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook in an attempt to improve competition. Those firms must comply with a range of rules or face significant penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s annual worldwide revenue or up to 20% for repeat offenders.Read More: Apple on Collision Course With EU as Digital Law Kicks InApple’s rejigs have attracted mounting pressure from regulators and competitors. Last week it said it would restore a developer account for Epic Games Inc. — allowing the Fortnite maker to build its own EU app store, which could compete with Apple’s own. The reversal came a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker.Read More: Apple Reverses Move to Ban ‘Fortnite’ Maker From the EUThe company was also hit with a €1.8 billion fine in the EU this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. Apple’s appealing the penalty and has said that regulators failed to uncover any “credible evidence of consumer harm.”Apple made other moves to bring the App Store into compliance in the EU this year, including restructuring the fee it charges developers. The company scrapped its 30% commission for a cheaper rate of 17%. Instead, it implemented a 3% processing charge for apps that use Apple’s in-app purchasing system and a 50 cent fee per app install for software that’s downloaded more than 1 million times in a 12-month period.The EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg last week that “the DMA is quite specific, also when it comes to having a fee structure that actually enables people to use these new benefits.”Apple, along with Meta and TikTok, is fighting its designation as a “gatekeeper” in the EU courts.

2024-03-12 12:00:00+00:00,Apple to let developers distribute apps directly from their sites,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - Software developers who use Apple's App Store will be able to distribute apps to EU users directly from their websites this spring, the company said on Tuesday, as part of changes required by new EU rules forcing Apple to open up its closed eco-system.The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week, requires Apple to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and to allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%.""We're providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union, including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer's website,"" Apple said in a blogpost.""Apple will provide authorised developers access to APIs (application programming interfaces) that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users' apps, and more,"" the company said.Other changes include allowing developers who set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the marketplace developer's own apps with immediate effect.Developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.Apple's changes come amid continuing criticism from rivals that its compliance efforts are falling short. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.

2024-03-12 07:30:00+00:00,"The year of Spotify? Streaming giant might have outwitted Apple with David vs Goliath play, and you only need to look at their share prices for proof","It’s been a good month for Spotify. While the music streaming giant hasn’t had many of those in recent years, it looks to be righting the ship since layoffs in December as the group celebrated strong earnings and toasted an EU ruling against one of its biggest nemeses: Apple.Last Monday, the European Union slapped Apple with a €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) fine for preventing streaming platforms from informing users of cheaper offers away from the app.As a new EU competition act comes into law, Spotify’s five-year battle with Apple is increasingly looking like a David vs Goliath contest, and a look at the companies’ respective share prices would suggest Apple is wobbling.If you’re an iPhone owner among Spotify’s 236 million subscribers, you might be able to cast your mind back to paying for your first Spotify subscription, thanks mostly to its time-consuming nature.You were likely sitting on your phone ready to sign up, before you were asked to search for Spotify on a browser to make your purchase. You would eventually return to the app to log back in and start listening. Because of Apple’s tight controls, you couldn’t simply sign up there and then in the app.If you’re an Apple Music subscriber, the sign-up process was so simple you’re probably unlikely to recall the routine “double-tap” you used to start paying Apple a subscriptionThis has been the crux of the streamer’s ongoing gripe with Apple.Apple charges large developers a 30% commission on purchases and in-app purchases, including subscriptions, made through the company’s famous iOS platform, while charging some smaller developers a reduced rate.About 85% of developers of free apps don't pay Apple anything because they don't make any revenue from their apps.Spotify has, in turn, limited its iOS app to avoid paying those commission fees. It’s an anti-competitive move that’s affected numerous other content apps, including Audible and Amazon’s Kindle app.Apple said in a press release that Spotify pays the platform nothing. The Guardian pointed out that Spotify does at least pay a nominal $99 annual developer fee to the company.Spotify’s bigger point, though, is that Apple actively deters consumers from buying competitors’ products, which is worsened by the fact that it already runs its own rival service to Spotify, Apple Music.The EU’s investigation excluded the 30% commission charged by Apple in its investigation. However, this charge will go with the introduction of the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA).Since Spotify launched its complaint with the EU about these practices, the group hasn’t minced its words in a coordinated lobbying effort stretching across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.Traditionally press-shy CEO Daniel Ek published an op-ed in the Daily Mail last year, in which he claimed the company couldn’t survive if it were founded today, thanks to Apple’s commission rules.Earlier in February, Spotify rented out ads on bus stops across London criticizing Apple’s App Store rules.Apple defended itself by claiming that 85% of app developers pay no fees to distribute through the app store, as free apps don't pay any commission. It argued that developers with paid apps should have to pay to access the App Store’s billions of users.Those arguments are likely little consolation to Spotify, which has been forced to get around that 30% fine.The back and forth presented itself as a David vs Goliath battle between the two tech companies.While Spotify might go toe to toe with Apple in terms of name recognition, it is about a fifth of the size of the tech giant in terms of market value.And despite Spotify also—as Apple points out—sitting atop the music streaming industry, the role of David is one the group appears keen to have played up to.It’s difficult to know how Europe’s move to try and force Apple to open up its App Store will impact Spotify financially, mainly because there is no real comparison to what it means.The group will change its app in Europe following the rollout of the EU’s DMA on March 7, which will make it easier for users to pay in the app and receive in-app promotions.To get a simple idea of how investors think Spotify’s coup might play out, you just need a glance at the streamer’s share price.Spotify made some easy gains in valuation with the brutal culling of 17% of staff before Christmas last year, its biggest-ever round of layoffs as the company sought efficiency gains.But in the month since Spotify released its fourth-quarter earnings, which showed better-than-expected income and subscriber numbers, shares in the company have jumped 10%. Spotify gave up some of its previous gains as markets closed Friday.With earnings data digested, much of this rise is likely attributable to Spotify’s fight with Apple.The streamer is about $10 billion more valuable at the time of writing than it was a month before. Shares rose nearly 3% in one day following the EU’s announcement of a fine on Apple.Meanwhile Apple has lost nearly three times Spotify’s entire market value since the EU’s announcement Monday, losing $140 billion in market cap.“Apple’s ongoing App store rule review in the EU will be an important factor to determine potential future states for pricing,” Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote last month before the EU’s verdict.“Spotify seems to have contemplated alternative pricing models but Apple’s rules appear to have prevented further experimentation on this front.”As Ek put it in a call with investors in February, the future upsides to Spotify’s new pricing models are “quite significant.”There is a 366 million-person gap between the number of monthly listeners on the platform and paid-up subscribers. It’s unclear how much easier access to subscriptions will close that gap, but at least in Europe, Spotify is about to find out.Spotify is also planning to make audiobook purchases in the app and the launch of a superfan platform as new tangible ways of driving income in a post-DMA world.Ek isn’t finished berating Apple, and he is far from satisfied with how the app market is laid out. Following the EU’s ruling, Ek said Apple wants to “close down the internet and make it theirs.”But moves to break up big tech in Europe will likely have ripple effects elsewhere.“As opposed to a couple of decades ago, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, tend to work more in tandem, or at least get inspired by each other,” Emmanuel Legrand, a music industry expert and editor of Creative Industries News, told Fortune.After a turbulent battle for profitability that has rivaled its scrap with Apple, the EU’s announcement could signal a new dawn for Spotify, just as Apple fights its own demise.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/spotify-streaming-giant-might-outwitted-073000149.html

2024-03-11 21:14:49+00:00,AI trade is now strictly 'fundamental': Strategist,"As the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks experience heightened volatility, Schwab Asset Management CEO and Chief Investment Officer Omar Aguilar joins Yahoo Finance Live to provide insight into how investors should navigate their portfolios during this period.Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term.With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: Meta isn't the only megacap seeing some losses. For more on the recent struggles from the Magnificent Seven, and where investors should look to turn to outside of big tech. We want to welcome in Omar Aguilar, Schwab Asset Management CEO, and CIO.Omar, thank you so much for being here. So as we see, what looks like a faltering perhaps of the Mag Seven, as well as a broadening of rallies elsewhere in the market, where do you think investors should be looking? Is it either, or is it both, how do you think about it?OMAR AGUILAR: Well, that's a great question and very timely I think as you were discussing this earlier. The momentum trade has started worldwide when everybody was talking about AI over a year ago. I think that momentum trade started to just be as just a function of excitement, just a function of-- investors getting really excited about the potential.I think as we go in through this year, this has actually shifted from just being just a momentum trade to be a fundamental trade. And if you actually think so earnings, despite the valuation numbers for these Magnificent Seven, has been significantly better than the rest of the market. So they have outperformed over EPS year-over-year growth of 60%. Whereas the rest of the market has actually been on a decline of EPS growth.So when you actually put that together with the fact that they also have had very consistent free cash flow yields, you know, that actually provides a lot of the support. Now, that's the past. The future, basically, expectations required a lot of the discussion that you just had, which is a significant amount of ramp up of CapEx and R&D in order for them to support what the market expects they will deliver in the future.- Omar, is it that the next shoe to drop here? That once these companies report in coming weeks, there's no possible way they can meet up to the expectations that have been priced into their stocks. So that's what investors are doing today selling these positions.OMAR AGUILAR: Well, I think the investors are looking at the relative valuations. They're basically looking at it. It looks a little bit higher now compared to any other big runs in markets.They're still not at the level of what we saw in the late '90s or even in the energy boom that we had afterwards. So still in that context, you know, it's really more about the function of the expectations.Over the next five years is that they will deliver 30% top line growth and 17% on EPS growth, which is very hard to sustain. So investors are questioning whether or not that's actually sustainable. And there are a couple of those seven that are in the process of ramping up that R&D, and that CapEx. That obviously may have a better future going forward.JULIE HYMAN: Omar, I want to ask about CPI tomorrow, right? Because it has seemed in recent weeks that the focus has shifted a little bit away from the Fed, and to earnings, and to the AI theme. Does CPI tomorrow shift the focus back, or does it just depend on what the number shows?OMAR AGUILAR: I think, in general, we should expect more volatility. I think once we got past the earnings season, you know, I think the question becomes the CPI reading is really just going to ask, or give us a little more information of what the reaction function by the Fed might be. And it's really just about the timing where they may actually come up with the first rate cut.And I think investors will continue to look at opportunities to take that volatility, whether it's valuation-driven, or whether it's related to macro to be able to rebalance their portfolio and strategically positioned for the next six months on an environment that will have lower interest rates on the short part of the curve.- If one is worried about the AI trade fizzling out, Omar, what is the best sector they should be looking at right now and make your case?OMAR AGUILAR: Yeah, I think what we have encouraged our clients to do is to-- if you think about the economic cycle as we are today, even with the CPI numbers tomorrow, we have all signed that this is the last phase of the cycle. What that means is that soft landing scenario that the Fed has talked to us is basically now being a reality.And what that means is that the cyclical trade going into the next phase is probably areas that will basically provide good opportunities. And that includes materials, that includes energy, that includes areas that are a little bit more prone to lower interest rates, or at least a shape of the yield curve that is more normal like financials.So I think we're encouraged clients to start looking at that. And we have seen already small caps are incredibly attractive, and the rest of the market outside of just the large mega caps will probably do well.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/ai-trade-now-strictly-fundamental-211449801.html
2024-03-11 20:11:12+00:00,"Apple Stock Has 27% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed the broader market this year, down 10% year to date. Citi analyst Atif Malik rates the stock a buy, but he trimmed his near-term price target over concerns about sluggish iPhone demand in China.Malik's new price target is $220 a share, which still represents an upside over the next 12 months or so of 27% over the current share price of roughly $173.While Wall Street generally operates on a shorter time frame than the average investor, analysts' opinions can be valuable in understanding what is driving the stock's performance in the short term. In this case, the analyst cited weakening smartphone sales in China for the price target cut.Apple is coming off a strong quarter, where iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. However, a recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that weekly smartphone unit sales in China through the first six weeks of 2024 were down 7% year over year. Most notably, iPhone unit sales were down 24%.Weak demand in China doesn't mean Apple is losing its edge. While iPhone revenue in China fell last quarter, it also hit records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific.China is a wildcard for Apple, but the company's growing installed base of devices, which continues to hit record highs, is a better indicator of its global brand strength and where the business is headed over the long term.The stock is still a good investment.

2024-03-11 17:15:00+00:00,"Prediction: This Will Be the Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock by the End of 2024","If you're wondering why the stock market is back at all-time highs, there's one simple explanation: The ""Magnificent Seven.""This is the group of the seven most valuable tech stocks that include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.These stocks delivered monster returns last year, and many of them are off to strong starts in 2024, capitalizing on the AI boom and the recovery coming out of the 2022 bear market. Today, Microsoft is the most valuable Magnificent Seven stock and the most valuable company in the world. However, I think we could see a passing of the torch this year. The company that is set to take Microsoft's place? AI superstar Nvidia, which is already dominating the AI chip market and the stock market narrative.Here are a few of the reasons Nvidia is a good bet to be the most valuable company in the world by the end of the year.It's no secret that Nvidia has ridden the generative AI boom to record returns. Since the start of 2023, the stock is up by more than 500%, topping a $1 trillion market cap before passing $2 trillion earlier this year.Its revenue has tripled and its profit is growing even faster, largely because Nvidia sells the vital components to build out the AI models and applications that almost every major corporation sees is betting on. That tech infrastructure relies on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), and there's been extraordinary demand for them as analysts estimate that the company owns a 98% share of the data center GPU market.It's true that competition is on the way. AMD launched its MI300 generative AI accelerator in December, but the company's first-quarter guidance indicates that its data center revenue will still be a fraction of Nvidia's.Competition entering the market doesn't mean it will make a significant dent in Nvidia's lead as Nvidia has technological and structural advantages over its aspiring rivals. Some industry insiders have predicted as much as well.For example, Matt Wood, a vice president of artificial intelligence products at AmazonWeb Services told The Information, ""There's no meaningful competition"" for Nvidia, and he was skeptical that AMD or anyone else could pose a significant challenge to the AI chip leader.If Nvidia can successfully defend its market share against AMD, Intel, and others, the stock should move even higher.Skeptics believe that Nvidia and other AI stocks are in a bubble, and its bumper profit is temporarily inflated by supply constraints for AI chips. Once that supply crunch is solved, they argue, prices will come down and Nvidia's profit will fall.However, there's no sign that supply imbalance will resolve itself anytime soon.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the recent earnings call, ""We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply,"" and CEO Jensen Huang elaborated, noting that supply is improving, but added, ""We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply.""Huang made another point that's key to understanding the supply demand dynamic in AI chips, saying, ""With all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products.""While competition may fill in supply for less powerful components, demand for cutting-edge technology is likely to continue to be difficult to meet, and that's where Nvidia excels. It should remain the leader in the product category, GPUs, which it invented 25 years ago and has advanced ever since.While Nvidia's near-term success will be determined by its data center business, investors shouldn't forget that the company has the ability to move into new markets such as PC chips, which it announced in January, and it's well positioned to capitalize on evolving markets such as autonomous vehicles and the metaverse.Nvidia's technology has a long history of finding new applications, including digital gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and now AI, but it's a mistake to think that it won't penetrate and dominate new markets as it's done with AI.The PC chip market presents an attractive opportunity for Nvidia, with tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue available, and Nvidia could turn the tables on AMD and Intel there, taking market share from them in PCs rather than ceding it in AI.Nvidia has soared past Wall Street's expectations in each of its past four quarters, showing that analysts continue to underestimate the company's growth and demand for its AI components.Currently, the average analyst expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share of $24.50, but that number is likely to go up, assuming the company's current momentum continues.At that valuation, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 40, making it not much more expensive than Apple or Microsoft, the two companies it's chasing to gain the title of the top Magnificent Seven stock. Microsoft trades at a P/E ratio of 35, based on estimates for its fiscal year that ends in June, and Apple trades at a forward P/E of 26.At a market cap of $2.32 trillion, Nvidia's stock price would have to increase 31% to eclipse Microsoft's current level of $3.04 trillion. That kind of gain looks to be within reach for Nvidia, given its dominance of AI chips and the ongoing supply crunch that should support its wide profit margin.It's no accident that Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in the AI boom. It holds the key to unlocking the power of generative AI, and that seems unlikely to change. As demand grows for AI and the components that make it work, Nvidia should go even higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The point with Alphabet is that it is expected to grow sales and earnings at considerably higher paces than the S&P 500, while its shares trade at a lower valuation than that of the index as a whole.Nvidia has a relatively high P/E of 34.1, but that valuation has come down considerably over the past year. Nvidia tops this list of 25 of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 whose EPS estimates have risen more quickly than the share prices.Related: Nvidia’s stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here’s the key to that rally.Getting back to Alphabet, the stock is down 5% from where it was at the end of 2021. It is useful to look at performance from that date, because the S&P 500 fell 18.2% in 2022, only to rise 26.3% in 2023. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.)So the S&P 500 is up only 3.4% since the end of 2021, while Alphabet is down 5% and Nividia’s stock has tripled in price.On Monday, Michael Nathanson, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a note to clients that Alphabet’s stock had been ”de-rated” relative to the S&P 500, reflecting investors’ concern over artificial intelligence and its possible effect on Google’s search business.He also pointed to a recent misstep, when Google botched the rollout of its Gemini AI tool for generating images.“Ironically, Alphabet’s long-term reluctance to ship AI products that were not yet safe, reliable, and responsible did not compute with what just happened here,” Nathanson wrote.The analyst also cited a ceding of advertising market share to Meta and Amazon “for much of the past decade.”But then he pointed to Meta, another company that had disappointed investors: CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s initial vision of the metaverse didn’t work out very well, and it was followed by a “year of efficiency” for the company in 2023, which helped reverse its share-price slide.Nathanson rates Alphabet’s Class A shares a buy, with a $175 price target, which is 29% higher than the stock’s closing price of $135.41 on Friday.Summing up, the analyst wrote that “the basic question is about Alphabet’s ability to harness their deep pool of world-class engineers and their long-term embrace [of] machine learning to build products thatconsumers want to use.”He concluded: “Judging by past accomplishments, despite current headlines, that seems like a bet that investors should be willing to make akin to buying Meta in the 4th quarter of 2022.”Here’s a summary of ratings and price targets for the Magnificent Seven among analysts polled by FactSet:CompanyTickerShare buy ratingsShare neutral ratingsShare sell ratingsMarch 8 priceConsensus price targetImplied 12-month upside potentialMicrosoft Corp.MSFT95%5%0%$406.22$469.9716%Apple Inc.AAPL58%30%12%$170.73$199.8617%Nvidia Corp.NVDA92%8%0%$875.28$897.213%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN95%5%0%$175.35$208.2219%Alphabet Inc.

2024-03-11 16:06:25+00:00,How Tesla can leverage R&D to stay in the Magnificent 7,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have fallen over 27% year to date, with fellow Magnificent Seven companies Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) also lagging behind the rest of the group. Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy?Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors.Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- Tesla is a Magnificent 7's biggest laggard year to date, but it's not the only one. Shares of Apple and Alphabet are also in the red since the start of the year. Now this week, we are focusing on these three laggards and what it's going to take for the companies to turn things around.Today, the focus is Tesla, currently trading just around 179 bucks a share, a loss of nearly 30% this year alone. Our next guest, though, saying that now could be a good buying opportunity. For more on that and what the catalyst will be, we want to bring in George Gianarikas.He's with Canaccord Genuity as a managing director there. George, it's great to see you. So talk to us about why you think Tesla is a buy at these levels?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, first, let's address the reason why it's lagged. I mean, it's pretty simple. The numbers have come down. I mean, if you look at the earnings revisions for the last 12 plus months, they've been terrible.I mean, I think we started for 2023 somewhere early in that year on $6, and it came all the way down to $3. And I think we're at a period of time right now where the worries likely exceed the reality. And we had some numbers last week come out of China that weren't very good.But people didn't take into account that the new year has been pushed into February. Also, some stuff that happened. In Germany, their plant came down for about a week because of arson, a week plus. And in the US, people are worried about the production of their new Model 3.And we think that the best way to kind of gauge for the most part of what's happening with Tesla, particularly in the US, is to look at their prices. And they've been pretty stable in the US over the last couple few months. So there's a lot of wood to chop still in the quarter. But in the near term, we think that we may have overcorrected here to the downside.- They talked on their most recent earnings call, George, about the spending and some of the record R&D that they had done during 2023, which now places a lot of emphasis on bringing that to fruition in 2024 and years following now. How much of that spending do you anticipate will lean further towards the side of this artificial intelligence narrative that has started to prevail with Tesla, even though we've seen some early slippage this year, at least, in the price action?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, we're in a little bit of a pause period right now for the stock. And the near term wiggles, we think we've overcorrected. But for the stock to really get its legs, we have to have three things happen. First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful.Second, their margins need to go up. And the most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI that they've built, in addition to volumes starting to pick back up. And third, it's continuation in growth, really good growth in their energy storage business.So when you talk about leveraging this R&D that they've spent a lot on, it's two real products that come out of that, the big spending. It's number one, that next generation vehicle, which we think should start production in the second half of 2025 and continued FSD penetration.Now we think that the FSD offering from the company at $12,000 currently is a little too rich, particularly relative to the cost of the vehicle. We think the company should cut the price of that FSD to really increase penetration and really have the margins start to turn in. If you think about it, that offering is about 100% gross margin very, very high gross margin because it's a software upgrade.- George, we have seen, though, the price wars play out, obviously, Tesla far from the only automaker, one of many, I should say, that has been forced to lower the prices, obviously, putting pressure on margins, very similar to what you were just saying. How do you see that more broadly speaking beyond Tesla shaking out just a bit? And that pressure to the downside in terms of boosting demand, how much longer are they going to be forced to prices in order to drive the demand that we simply have not seen?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, look, there's been a pause, like I said, recently. Particularly, in the US, the price declines that we saw for the most part in 2023 is sort of ebbed right now, which for us, is indication that maybe things aren't that bad. And what the company did strategically by being that aggressive is, first of all, they got to sell more vehicles.Right? Because interest rates went up, and most people finance the purchase of their vehicles. So that meant that the prices of vehicles went up artificially. But second, it put a lot of their competitors on their back legs.I mean, margins got a lot worse for some of the pure play EV competitors. Sales got a lot worse for them. And even for the traditional OEMs that try to compete against Tesla, their margins got significantly worse because they couldn't compete with Tesla on price. So what we saw is-- longer term what Tesla did is put a lot of its competition on the back foot, particularly in the United States and Europe.- And so, let's talk then about China because that's one of the larger kind of lingering risks right now for Tesla. Is sentiment shifting so much in the region that there would be a longer term implication for how Tesla is able to operate and sell into China, as well?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: That's a great question. I mean, look, we see the real competition for Tesla long term, like, we really like Rivian in the United States, and in parts of Europe, and other parts of North America. But in China, specifically, there are some very, very good OEM competitors from pure play EV companies.The company has one plant in China right now, able to produce about 950,000 vehicles. And they're running-- despite this monthly volatility, they're running full tilt there. And we'll continue-- we continue to believe they'll run full tilt in that country. So there's really good competition in China, but we think Tesla can operate that factory at relatively full capacity that leaves them in a good place in that country.- So, George, as we wrap this up, we started this segment talking about the share price being under pressure. We're trading around 179 bucks a share today. What more specifically does that upside look like?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, our price target is in the 230s, and we base that on 26 times our 2026 estimates. And we think that's going to happen as volumes start to pick up next year and the year after that based on increased Cybertruck production and the next generation vehicle.And importantly, we think that the margins will start to get better, particularly as we've seen an abatement and price reductions, at least, for now and costs continue to come down for the company. So, in the near term, we have these wiggles. And we think like we said, we've overcorrected to the downside in the near term.But for real outperformance, we need to-- next generation vehicle or some visibility into that increased margins based on FSD mostly and continued growth in their energy storage business. Those three things will really get the stock to get its outperformance legs of old back.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/tesla-leverage-r-d-stay-160625612.html
2024-03-11 15:37:13+00:00,Apple’s hysterics over the new EU antitrust law have led to two climbdowns already—and the law hasn’t even been in force for a week,"European Commission 2–Apple 0.The EU’s Digital Markets Act has been in place for less than five days, and its enforcers have already pushed Apple into two humiliating U-turns. If Apple has been trying to test how much it can throw its weight around in its increasingly hilarious hissy fit over the new Big Tech antitrust law, it’s had its answer now.The first reversal came earlier this month when Apple meekly agreed to let home-screen web apps continue functioning as intended on iPhones. It had previously killed off the entire category on the basis of protecting users’ security under a rather odd reading of the DMA. The Commission threatened an investigation, and Apple retreated.Then, on Friday, Apple agreed to reinstate a developer account for archnemesis Epic Games, effectively allowing it to roll out a third-party iOS app store (an actual DMA demand) and also finally return Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU.Apple’s reason for axing Epic’s account was that Epic had previously violated Apple’s policy by launching an alternative to Apple’s payment system for in-app payments (which is why Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store in 2020). Apple had also argued that Epic’s criticism of Apple’s new EU business model meant it couldn’t be trusted to follow the terms for third-party app stores, even though Epic had promised to abide by them. Apple’s reasoning was doubly ludicrous because a) the Commission wants affected companies to give feedback on Big Tech’s attempts to comply with the DMA, and b) Apple claimed a California court ruling gave it the ability to cancel Epic’s developer accounts anytime it wanted, anywhere in the world.After the Commission again threatened an investigation—and presumably after Apple’s lawyers googled “jurisdiction”—the company again backed down. “I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,” cackled Commission digital chief Thierry Breton in an X post. “From Day 2, [the] DMA is already showing very concrete results!”I think at this point it’s fair to say that Tim Cook’s team has been massively overreaching in its response to the DMA. But hey, nobody ever said compliance with EU tech law was easy.You know who else just learned that lesson? The European Commission.This morning, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)—the privacy regulator that specifically keeps an eye on big EU institutions—slammed the Commission for breaking a 2018 data-protection law in how its staff use Microsoft 365. The watchdog said the Commission had failed to implement safeguards to ensure that people’s personal data is only being sent to countries whose data-protection rules are equivalent to the EU’s. What’s more, the Commission hadn’t been properly specifying what types of personal data would be collected in the use of Microsoft 365, and what the data would be used for, as the law demands. (This isn’t the well-known General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, but rather a special companion law that only applies to the EU institutions.)As a result, the Commission will have to “suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the [EU and European Economic Area]” that lack adequate privacy protections. It’s unclear which countries the watchdog means. The EDPS has given the Commission until early December to comply, reflecting how difficult it will be to comply with the decision without majorly disrupting the Commission’s work.The Commission insists that its use of Microsoft 365 is legally compliant; it’s studying the EDPS order before deciding how to respond. But, it said in a statement, “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the current high level of mobile and integrated IT services. This applies not only to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services.”Fairly or not, I suspect quite a few Silicon Valley regulatory officers will be chuckling at the irony of the situation.

Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre eyes several of the group's biggest laggards, highlighting EV maker Tesla's (TSLA) year-to-date losses.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks suffered declines last week with Tesla faring the worst, off about 13.5%. And despite the Mag Seven accounting for around 50% of S&P 500 gains this year, three of its members are lagging behind. Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the red year to date.And once again, you see Tesla leading losses. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, he's over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Such as it is, sometimes we group these stocks together arbitrarily. They might be doing something similar for a limited period of time and then they get stuck. And here we have the Magnificent Seven with huge dispersion between the contributions-- among the contributions to the S&P 500 market cap.You look at NVIDIA over there, it's up $965 billion. And then you take a look at Tesla down $231 billion. As NVIDIA's contributing 33% of the market cap gains of the S&P 500, Tesla is responsible for negative 8%.And sometimes math is just not intuitive that way. But the point is besides these four groups of stocks that are advancing, you have these other three. And to be fair, all seven of these stocks have very, very different narratives.I want to point out Tesla versus NVIDIA. So this is the first in class, this is last in class in the Mag Seven. And this what's happening year to date. You can see Tesla down about 27%, NVIDIA up about 78%.And if I show you a two-year chart, you can really see back when their fortunes diverged. Because it was off of the October lows in 2022 that we saw this big rally and we saw the Mag Seven, kind of, in lockstep. But you can see the fortunes diverging as we proceeded in the year, that was last year.Now, I also want to show some technical analysis on Tesla over the last five years. And what I'm seeing here is just a giant trading range with a couple of forays above and below. And so here we got above the trading range here. We got below around the turn of the year one year ago.But for the most part, we are in a trading range. Until that breaks, difficult to see or difficult to get excited about Tesla going in any direction or the other. It looks like it got a little bit of time.So I do want to go to our Mag 100-- or NASDAQ 100 heat maps so I can just check out the totals here. It's been interesting. I've been watching Eli Lilly surge ahead of Tesla in terms of market cap. And here we see Tesla at $571 billion short of AVGO, that's Broadcom. That change was made last week. And now Visa, looks like Tesla heading for Visa's market cap next.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/magnificent-7-laggards-tesla-stock-151336705.html
2024-03-11 15:02:05+00:00,TD taps into iPhones for a leg up in merchant acquiring,"Years after companies like Square convinced micro-merchants that they could accept payments with their smartphones, banks are starting to make the same pitch — without the need for an add-on ""dongle"" or similar hardware.TD Bank, for example, last week added Tap to Pay on iPhone to a growing bundle of products that it sells to businesses. Tap to Pay, also called softPOS, enables Apple or Android handsets to accept payments from contactless cards or mobile wallets. More payment companies are using Tap to Pay to enable fast and cheap contactless payment upgrades. PayPal adopted Tap to Pay last week to enhance the products it offers to merchants. Financial institutions can also use it to reduce merchants' reliance on third parties.""Small businesses are inundated with a number of applications to manage cash flow and back offices,"" said Jo Jagadish, executive vice president and head of commercial banking products, services and innovation at TD Bank, where she leads the bank's business payment strategy. ""Payments is just one of those capabilities that merchants use, but it can drive usage for other products.""The bank noted a massive consumer shift towards contactless payments that started during the pandemic, creating ongoing demand for merchants to adopt contactless payment, according to Jagadish. Tap to Pay enables businesses of all sizes to access mobile commerce and banking, but is particularly useful in reaching smaller merchants, she said.Tap to Pay is an Apple technology, but Apple is not a payment processor, creating an opportunity for other companies to sell the technology to banks or merchants. TD Bank added Tap to Pay through its collaboration with Autobooks. TD Bank is an investor in Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping provider, which it uses to support digital invoices, debit and credit card payments, cash flow management and accounting as part of the TD small business checking account.TD Bank has added other merchant services accessible via the checking account over the past few years, including Zelle and digital invoicing. All of these functions involve the mobile phone, making Tap to Pay a good fit, Jagadish said.""The majority of our customers use Apple devices,"" Jagadish said.TD Bank is upgrading its business banking operation as it faces challenges in other areas that involve technology. The bank is upgrading anti money-laundering systems amid a regulatory probe of AML practices at the bank and is also in the midst of an institution-wide cost cutting initiative. The bank's public relations office said the Tap to Pay deployment and related merchant services products are not part of the AML issues.Autobooks clients include Citizens Bank, Zions Bank and hundreds of small community banks. It has licensed its technology to FIS, Jack Henry, NCR and other firms that sell payments and financial technology. About 50 banks are live with Tap to Pay contactless payments via Autobooks.Another user, Centier Bank, has also used Tap to Pay as a bridge to a larger merchant product bundle. Centier, a $7.5 billion-asset bank that operates mostly in Northwest Indiana, offers accounting, checking and digital invoicing, among other merchant services. ""By using Tap to Pay, a business can support payments, sending and receiving through their bank account with us rather than worrying about a third party. We think that's an advantage for us,"" said Tim Coleman, senior vice president and director of wealth management and small business at Centier Bank.Tap to Pay enables the bank to support digital payments for all merchants, regardless of size, according to Coleman. The bank's clients include about 20,000 businesses, ranging from ""side hustles"" to larger manufacturing businesses, with a diverse mix of other merchants. ""It's an intersection of businesses. You never know where the demand is going to come from,"" said Coleman.TD Bank and Centier — and thousands of other financial institutions — are battling JPMorgan Chase, the largest merchant acquiring bank in the U.S. JPMorgan recently upgraded its merchant acquiring business by launching a platform that integrates payment channels alongside a set of tools that support checkout and other functions in stores, online and in mobile apps. JPMorgan added support for Tap to Pay for iPhone in 2023, and plans to add biometric check-in and additional contactless payment features in future deployments.All three banks compete with merchant-focused fintechs like Stripe, PayPal and Block, all of which have adopted softPOS or Tap to Pay. Adyen, a Dutch payment technology company, is using Tap to Pay to bolster its point of sale technology in brick and mortar in tandem with its e-commerce technology.Banks can integrate new products into existing services as a way to compete with larger institutions to attract merchants, including smaller businesses, according to Mattew Golden, president of Totavi, a card consulting practice.""The proliferation of standardized payment platforms such as Square, Stripe, Shopify and Toast means that fewer businesses are proactively making decisions about their underlying merchant acquirer; instead they are choosing a platform and then that platform is choosing an acquirer,"" Golden said, adding that to respond to this trend, institutions can connect businesses to newer payment technology using application programming interfaces or similar connecting technology — thus reducing the need for extensive integration.""As always, another area where smaller institutions can succeed is in service and support,"" Golden said.

2024-03-11 12:30:00+00:00,"1 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have had a phenomenal run in terms of not only stock performance but also business gains. Well, except for one. Over the past 12 months, each member of the group has averaged these revenue growth levels:CompanyOne-Year Average YOY Revenue GrowthMicrosoft17.6%Apple(0.6%)Nvidia139.8%Amazon11.7%Alphabet8.5%Meta Platforms15.4%Tesla21%Data Source: YCharts. YOY = Year over Year.Two things stick out here. First, Nvidia is doing unbelievably well compared to its peers. Second, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has averaged losing revenue over the past 12 months while every other company on this list has grown.That's a huge red flag, making me want to stay far away from Apple's stock.When you dig in, it's evident that Apple's stock has become disconnected from the business. Most investors would assume that if Apple's revenue shrank over the past year, its stock would be flat or even down. But you'd be wrong.Apple's stock is up roughly 12% over the past year, making it the second-worst performer of the group behind Tesla (down 5%). But how can a stock that has shrinking revenue increase in stock price?Revenue doesn't have everything to do with how a stock is valued. There are a couple of other considerations to factor in. One of those is profits.Over the same period, its revenue averaged a decline, but its earnings per share (EPS) averaged an 8.8% increase. Because Apple was disciplined with its operating expenses and engaged in stock buybacks, it grew its EPS despite falling revenue. This is a sign of a strong and well-managed business, something most people would say about Apple.Another factor in Apple's stock price rise is multiple expansion. What people are willing to pay for a stock fluctuates, and depending on various factors, this number can rise or fall. How ""expensive"" a stock is often described by a valuation ratio, like the price-to-earnings (P/E) metric, which divides a company's stock price by its EPS.For Apple, investors were willing to pay more and more for shares, although this figure has come down since the start of 2024.Paying more than 30 times earnings for a company with shrinking revenue is very expensive, even for a company with the pedigree of Apple. This is part of why the stock has fallen nearly 12% since the start of 2024, while many of its peers have gained that much.But with a more reasonable stock price, why am I not willing to touch Apple's stock with a 10-foot pole?While Apple is a solid business, its products have nearly become commodities in the past few years. Plenty of other smartphone and accessory makers have quality products, so it comes down to user choice.Additionally, the sales cycles of these products have become elongated thanks to how advanced the latest product generations have been. This has caused revenue to stagnate and likely won't pick up anytime soon until Apple finds a new product to launch.Businesses can only maintain expenses for so long before raising prices or compressing margins. Both of these would harm Apple, and I don't envision a scenario where Apple can consistently grow its earnings at a healthy pace with low revenue growth.With the stock trading at 27 times earnings, it's way more pricey than its peer, Alphabet, which trades at 23 times earnings with better growth.At the end of the day, Apple isn't a bad company; it just isn't worth the price tag you must pay for it. With longtime Apple bulls like Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway selling shares, the writing may be on the wall for the formerly largest company in the world.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11 11:02:00+00:00,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's outstanding surge in the past year has led to a massive jump in its market cap, and the semiconductor giant is now counted as one of the world's largest companies. More specifically, Nvidia's market cap of $2.22 trillion means it is now the third-biggest company globally, ranking just behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has a market cap of $2.61 trillion.It is worth noting that these tech giants have experienced divergent fortunes on the stock market in 2024. While shares of Nvidia shot up 79% this year already, Apple stock has moved in the opposite direction, dipping 12% as of this writing. As a result, Nvidia is now within touching distance of Apple's market cap.But can Nvidia stock continue soaring and overtake Apple's market cap by next year? Let's find out.A key reason Nvidia's market cap has grown while Apple's has declined is the different trajectories of the two companies. Nvidia is making the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, which is growing at a terrific pace. According to third-party estimates, the AI chip market is estimated to clock an annual growth rate of 38% through the end of the decade and generate $207 billion in annual revenue.Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion thanks to the lucrative AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it dominates with an estimated market share of 98%, according to Wells Fargo. Nvidia is also enjoying terrific margins in AI GPUs as its chips are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is reflected in the company's bottom-line performance, with its fiscal 2024 earnings jumping 288% to $12.96 per share.On the other hand, the smartphone market is Apple's bread and butter. The iPhone produced 58% of its total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended Dec. 31, 2023). However, Apple's top line increased just 2% year over year to $119.6 billion during the quarter, while earnings were up 16% to $2.18 per share. Its iPhone revenue increased 6% year over year during the quarter, while sales of iPads and wearables fell. Also, sales of Apple's MacBooks remained flat last quarter.A closer look at the end markets Apple serves tells us why it is growing more slowly than Nvidia. The smartphone market, for instance, is expected to grow by only 2.8% in 2024, as per IDC. The researcher estimates that smartphone sales will likely increase in the low single digits over the next five years. Tablet sales, meanwhile, are declining, while the personal computer (PC) market is forecast to turn around this year following steep declines in the past couple of years.Additionally, Apple doesn't enjoy Nvidia-like dominance in the markets it serves. Though Apple was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, its market share stood at 20.1%. Last year, Samsung was the second-biggest smartphone company, with a 19.4% market share. Apple was the fourth-largest company in PCs last year by shipments, controlling just 8.5% of this market.So, the bottom line is Nvidia is in pole position to capitalize on a fast-growing opportunity in the form of AI chips. Apple, however, is operating in mature markets where there are multiple contenders. As a result, it is unsurprising to see why Nvidia's revenue and earnings are forecast to increase much faster pace than Apple's.PeriodNvidia Revenue Rstimate (in $billion)Year-Over-Year GrowthApple Revenue Estimate (in $billion)Year-Over-Year GrowthCurrent fiscal year$110.281%$388.31%Next fiscal year$130.719%$412.76%Two fiscal years ahead$150.015%$433.45%Source: YCharts.Also, Apple's earnings are expected to grow at a much slower annual rate of 11% over the next five years compared to the 36% annual earnings growth Nvidia is expected to deliver during the same period. As such, seeing the market reward Nvidia with more gains won't be surprising. Apple stock, on the other hand, could remain in the doghouse thanks to the slow-growing nature of the smartphone market and recent developments suggesting the company may be late to the AI game.iPhone sales in China reportedly fell an alarming 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Huawei gained at Apple's expense and recorded a 64% spike in sales during the same period. Meanwhile, Apple's biggest smartphone competitor, Samsung, has already jumped onto the AI smartphone bandwagon with its latest Galaxy series of smartphones. The good news for Samsung is that it expects to sell more flagship phones than its original forecast, and AI seems to be playing a key role in driving this performance.This gives Samsung an advantage over Apple, which is yet to launch an AI-focused smartphone.Apple has already lost the title of the world's largest company by market cap to Microsoft. And now, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia displace Apple and climb up the rankings.As shown in the table above, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump to almost $131 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). Nvidia is trading at 35 times sales right now. While that's expensive, Nvidia has been able to justify its expensive valuation with outstanding growth in recent quarters.The solid opportunity in AI chips means the market could also reward Nvidia with a rich sales multiple in the future. Assuming Nvidia maintains a discounted sales multiple of 25 next year and generates $131 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $3.27 trillion.Apple, for comparison, trades at 7 times sales, slightly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 6. Giving Apple a higher sales multiple doesn't make sense, considering its slower growth. Assuming it generates $413 billion in revenue next year and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could go to $2.9 billion, indicating Nvidia seems set to become a bigger company than Apple by 2025.That's why investors looking to buy one of these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have an easy choice about where to put their money.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11 10:23:00+00:00,"Which Megacap Stock Has the Greatest GAAP Net Worth? Hint: It's Not Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia.","Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the biggest company of all? That might seem like an easy question to answer. Just use a stock screen that sorts by descending market cap.For much of the past few years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) claimed the biggest market cap of all publicly traded companies. Thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took over the No. 1 spot earlier in 2024. This AI boost has also put Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) within striking distance of the top position.But the real answer to the question depends on how you define ""biggest."" Warren Buffett recently discussed the biggest company based on net worth as measured by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). And it isn't Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia.GAAP net worth is better known by another name -- book value. It's also sometimes referred to as shareholder's equity.The calculation of GAAP net worth is straightforward:Determine a company's total assets (found on its balance sheet)Determine the company's total liabilities (also on the balance sheet)Subtract total liabilities from total assets to get the GAAP net worthThere's also an even simpler way to find a company's GAAP net worth. Just look at the value for total stockholders' (or shareholders') equity on the balance sheet.Microsoft's market cap tops $3 trillion. The tech giant's GAAP net worth, though, is a much lower $238.3 billion.It's a similar story for Apple. The iPhone maker has a market cap of more than $2.6 trillion. But Apple's GAAP net worth is only $74.1 billion.The difference is even more pronounced for Nvidia. Although the chipmaker's market cap has skyrocketed to over $2.3 trillion, its GAAP net worth is a little under $43 billion.So if the largest company based on GAAP net worth isn't Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia, which company holds the No. 1 spot? Since I mentioned Buffett earlier, you can probably guess who the U.S. winner is. It's his own Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B).As of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's GAAP net worth stood at nearly $561.3 billion. The conglomerate is more than twice the size of Microsoft based on the metric. It's nearly 7.6 times bigger than Apple and over 13 times larger than Nvidia.Berkshire boasts the largest GAAP net worth by far of any U.S. business in history, according to Buffett in his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders. He noted that the total GAAP net worth for the S&P 500 excluding Berkshire was $8.9 trillion in 2022. While the total hasn't been calculated yet for 2023, Buffett doesn't think that it will be much higher than $9.5 trillion. He pointed out that Berkshire by itself makes up roughly 6% of the total GAAP net worth of the entire S&P 500.But while Berkshire has the biggest GAAP net worth among U.S. companies, there's a company outside the U.S. that's even bigger. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the GAAP net worth for giant oil and gas producer Saudi Aramco totaled $1.75 trillion.Why don't Berkshire Hathaway and Saudi Aramco get more props for being the biggest companies based on GAAP net worth? There are some drawbacks to using the financial metric. For example, asset values can sometimes be understated or overstated. Intangible assets are especially tricky to accurately value.Market cap still matters. However, there's perhaps an even better measurement for determining the biggest companies -- enterprise value (EV). This metric adds a company's market cap and its total debt then subtracts cash and equivalents.What's the biggest megacap company based on EV? Microsoft comes out on top, just as it does based on market cap.For investors, though, how much a company can grow is more important than how big it is now. There are plenty of stocks that are likely to grow faster than Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, or Berkshire Hathaway.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11 09:21:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Has Bought Shares of This Stock for 22 Consecutive Quarters -- and It's Not Apple or Occidental,"There are a number of great money managers on Wall Street, but few, if any, can hold a candle to the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" Warren Buffett. Since Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a greater than 4,900,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.Patient investors have become financially independent mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's investments. This can be done by analyzing Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the most recent quarter.But while Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have clued investors into a number of businesses Buffett appreciates, the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy -- one which he's added to for 22 consecutive quarters -- won't be found on his company's 13F.A quick glance at Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio would appear to suggest that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Warren Buffett's favorite business. After all, it accounted for 42.5% of invested assets as of the closing bell on March 6.Innovation is a big reason Apple held the title of world's largest publicly traded company for so long (it only recently ceded this title to Microsoft). Since upgrading iPhone to handle 5G speeds in late 2020, the company's flagship smartphone has accounted for half or more of domestic smartphone market share. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't understand the mechanics of how an iPhone works, he fully understands consumer behavior and the exceptional loyalty of Apple's customers to its products.But what investors may have overlooked is Apple's innovation beyond its physical products. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing an extended transformation that has Apple focused on various subscription services. Subscriptions should smooth out Apple's revenue recognition during iPhone upgrade cycles, steadily lift the company's operating margin over time, and encourage Apple's customers to stay within the company's ecosystem of products and services.However, the best aspect of owning a lot of Apple stock for Warren Buffett might be its unbeatable capital-return program. Apple is returning $14.8 billion annually in dividends to its shareholders, and has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett is a huge fan of businesses that reward long-term-minded investors like himself.The other stock in Berkshire's portfolio that you'd probably think is Warren Buffett's favorite to buy is energy juggernaut Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Since the beginning of 2022, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have purchased more than 248 million shares of Occidental -- a position with a market value of $15.2 billion.Although energy stocks haven't played a big role in Berkshire's portfolio throughout much of this century, the past couple of years have represented something of a change of heart for Buffett and his team. Piling into Occidental the way Berkshire's investment team has signals that they believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms, or perhaps head even higher.While it's tough to predict the directional movements of energy commodities with any certainty, there are factors working in Buffett's favor. For instance, capital underinvestment for multiple years from energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, it's not uncommon for the price of that commodity to rise.A higher spot price for crude oil would be noteworthy for two reasons for Occidental. First, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. If the price of oil climbs, it disproportionately benefits, when compared to other integrated oil and gas operators.Secondly, Occidental is still digging itself out of debt. The company is counting on a higher spot price to fuel the steady paydown of its remaining debt.Though it's abundantly clear that Apple and Occidental Petroleum are core holdings in the $361 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, neither stock has been purchased by the Oracle of Omaha for 22 consecutive quarters.To find Warren Buffett's favorite stock, investors will want to peer beyond the company's 13Fs and take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Contained within these operating results is a section on share repurchases. That's right -- the stock Buffett genuinely can't stop buying is shares of his own company.Share buybacks at Berkshire Hathaway took a big turn in mid-July 2018. Prior to this point, repurchases could only be undertaken if the company's shares traded at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire Hathaway's stock never retreated to or below this preset threshold, the company went years without any share repurchases.Everything changed on July 17, 2018, which is when Berkshire's board reworked the covenants governing share repurchases to allow Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger to work their magic.Under the new criteria, as long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and both Buffett and Munger agreed that shares of their company were intrinsically cheap, buybacks could continue with no preset cap.During the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett oversaw the repurchase of 3,623 Class A shares and 660,585 Class B shares (BRK.B) of Berkshire stock at a total cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the criteria for buybacks changed in July 2018, Buffett has bought back more than $74 billion worth of his company's stock, with repurchases occurring every single quarter.The reason the Oracle of Omaha and his team spend such a small fortune on buybacks is because it's the easiest way to reward investors who share their long-term vision. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regular buybacks are incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders.Furthermore, buying back stock can lift earnings per share (EPS) for businesses with steady or growing net income. As Berkshire's outstanding share count shrinks over an extended period, EPS should increase. Ideally, this makes Berkshire Hathaway appear even cheaper to investors.Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, Warren Buffett buying back shares of his favorite stock, Berkshire Hathaway, is a virtual given.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

The benchmark index has scaled all-time highs in 2024, but the performance of those mega-caps has diverged more recently.While AI darling Nvidia has soared to a record high, Apple shares entered a technical correction this month amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.A note from Bank of America Corp. last week showed technology funds suffered their biggest outflows on record.

2024-03-11 07:07:00+00:00,"A Third ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?","The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.The ""Magnificent Seven"" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.Alphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.The 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.For example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign.The 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock.Notice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.In the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.A great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.The market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.If you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.Another recent example is Target (NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.In sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.The best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.Similarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.In other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.Some of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.It happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.The point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.The biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.Apple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.The market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI).

But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.The Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.

Apple, which is a partner and also a competitor for domestic banks, doesn’t give access to the near field communication chip on its iPhones, and instead requires banks to send payments using Apple Pay.“They are very sophisticated companies who are playing a very deliberate game and it should be a very clear agenda item for government and policymakers,” Comyn said, referring to the US technology giant. He was speaking at the AFR Business Summit in Sydney.Macquarie Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Shemara Wikramanayake, speaking on a panel at the same conference later in the day, said she won’t buy into the regulation of the so-called Magnificent Seven, companies that do “an amazing job for the US and the world.”“The US and the world does need to allow other competition to come in, but that’s something for regulators to sort out,” she said when asked whether the Australian government should place more attention on Apple’s market power.“Basically we take the world as we see it and work with it. They’re contributing a lot and we’re focusing on the positive in how we engage with them,” she said.Comyn also reiterated his opinion on hybrid work, a policy which requires his staff to spend at least 50% of their time in the office.

Epic had created the account in an effort to put Fortnite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. Apple must allow third-party stores on its devices, under the new European law.The developer accounts are important because software creators cannot distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without one. Apple had previously terminated some of Epic's developer accounts in 2020, after Epic purposely broke Apple's in-app payment rules, using its violation of the rules and subsequent banishment from the App Store as the core of public relations and legal campaign against Apple.Two days after terminating the developer account, Apple had reversed its decision and Epic changed its tone.APPLE'S NEW MACBOOK AIR MODELS ROLLING OUT THIS WEEK""Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account,"" Epic said on X.

2024-03-10 14:53:59+00:00,Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better,"Apple’s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it’s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you’re looking for a Windows laptop.But if you’re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that’s no different with the company’s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it’s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.Available March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple’s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.Both are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.My review unit came equipped with Apple’s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you’re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that’s the exact configuration I’d recommend you buy. It’ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.If you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.If you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you’re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.As far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year’s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.I’m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven’t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn’t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you’re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.The latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.Battery life is as fantastic as you’d expect from an Air running on one of Apple’s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I’ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.Of course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment’s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.One of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” thanks to the M3’s built-in neural engine. It’s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn’t exactly some kind of new development.It’s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it’s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.My only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you’re used to having a connector on your system’s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.Overall, Apple’s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you’ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you’re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you’re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it’s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple’s chips.It’s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year’s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don’t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it’s still a fantastic laptop.If you’d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won’t be disappointed.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-10 12:35:00+00:00,"Apple Could Launch Its Most Important Product Since the iPhone This Summer, According to a Pair of Wall Street Analysts","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) could use a new blockbuster product, and it could come as soon as this summer.The iPhone maker saw sales rise just 2% last quarter after a year in which revenue fell 2.8%. China remains a big question mark for Apple following a government ban of iPhones and a report indicating a massive decline in sales in the country to start the year. Meanwhile, the varying sources of its high-margin services revenue remain the focus of regulators around the world.But at least two Wall Street analysts think Apple will release the next product to set off a spurt of growth at the massive company this summer. Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe think investors should focus on what Apple will announce this summer at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).At Apple's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook promised investors the company will ""break new ground"" on generative AI this year.The claim follows comments the executive made during Apple's first-quarter earnings call. Cook said, ""We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort"" on AI, and ""I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI.""Apple recently shuttered its electric car development to focus more on the generative AI projects it's working on. Bloomberg previously reported the company is spending more than $1 billion per year on generative AI. But true to form, Apple hasn't talked much about what it's working on publicly before it's ready to announce a product set for release.That's coming this year, Cook says, and very likely planned for WWDC in June.""To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone,"" Reitzes and Monroe wrote in a note to investors. They see new AI features as a catalyst for a new iPhone supercycle next year as iPhone users upgrade their hardware to take advantage of new AI capabilities.While most AI companies are focused on either the hardware (semiconductors) or the software (large language models and applications), Apple, as always, is focused on the combination of the two. That could allow it to leapfrog competitors and push more AI capabilities to consumers.Apple builds some of the most advanced mobile processors on the market for the iPhone. A few years ago, it expanded its designs to its Mac lineup, and it now makes some very powerful chips for desktops and laptops as well. While these chips aren't going to power large language model training, which is mostly handled by remote servers full of GPUs, they may be exactly what's needed for on-device, or ""edge,"" AI applications.In other words, new Apple devices may be capable of implementing generative AI all while keeping data securely on a device. That opens the door for a lot more applications and use cases. And Apple could develop software that uses its large language model in a way that takes advantage of its capabilities.Another factor that separates Apple from the pack of big tech companies all developing products and services around generative AI is that Apple has multiple ways of monetizing its advancements in AI.Apple has historically made the bulk of its revenue from hardware sales. As Reitzes and Monroe mention in their note, AI advances could push more users to upgrade their iPhones. With over 2.2 billion active devices in use, it could sell a lot of iPhones just by convincing users to upgrade.More recently, Apple has focused on growing its services revenue, which leverages that massive user base. Apple could offer a subscription service that gives users more AI features. It could integrate it into its other subscription services like Apple Music and Apple News, or bundle it as part of its Apple One subscription.Apple could also give developers access to its AI models and other tools. That could be monetized through licensing revenue, or as analyst Dan Ives suggests, an ""AI app store.""The key differentiator for Apple is that it owns the platform, and it has several ways to monetize the user base on that platform. While shares currently trade for about 26x forward earnings, that valuation also takes into account Apple's massive cash position and its capital return program. If Apple's AI development proves to be its next big product, it could result in its price-to-earnings multiple expanding as revenue and profit growth reaccelerate.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10 12:00:00+00:00,"Bubble Angst Belied by Big-Tech Weaklings, Broader S&P 500 Gains","(Bloomberg) -- US stocks’ torrid climb to start 2024 is evoking worrisome comparisons with past boom-and-bust cycles on Wall Street, sparking debate over the risk that the market is overheating.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, DirectorBond Investors Are Lining Up to Fund the War Against PutinThere’s ample reason to wonder whether shares have advanced at an unsustainable pace: The S&P 500 Index has closed at record highs 16 times this year, accounting for about a third of all trading days; AI darling Nvidia Corp. has soared nearly 80%, adding roughly $1 trillion in market value, even after sliding Friday along with other tech shares; and speculative areas like Bitcoin have surged.Yet there are signs that the strength, based in large part on the economy’s resilience and robust corporate earnings, hasn’t turned into a speculative frenzy.Several of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks have sputtered, showing that investors aren’t throwing money at the market with abandon. The muted reaction to initial public offerings of late also backs up that notion. What’s more, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 just hit a historic high, indicating the rally is broadening out. And valuations of the benchmark’s biggest stocks are well below levels seen for the market leaders at the height of previous market cycles.Scott Chronert at Citigroup Inc. also notes that the seven megacap tech firms contribute roughly 20% to S&P 500 earnings, which he says largely justifies their market-capitalization weighting of about a third of the gauge.“There was a premise where you were trying to build out Internet infrastructure back then, much like right now we’re building out AI,” Chronert said. “But the nature of the companies’ revenue and the cash flows that are supporting it are markedly different.”Below are some charts that may dispel concerns of a bubble forming:Megacap DivideThe Magnificent Seven companies — Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia and Tesla Inc. — moved in unison through much of last year, driving the brunt of the market’s gains and reigning until very recently as the S&P 500’s biggest firms.The relentless demand for the group’s shares drew parallels to the speculative frenzy surrounding Internet stocks at the turn of the century.But the seven have diverged in 2024 as investors soured on the outlook for several firms, signaling that the froth around the cohort may have diminished.Apple has dropped this year, in part amid concern over iPhone sales in China. The firm closed at a record in December before retreating. With demand for its vehicles waning, Tesla has fared even worse, dropping below Eli Lilly & Co. in terms of market value. Google parent Alphabet has also declined this year.More ParticipantsCountering worries that a handful of shares were powering the bull run, the gains are showing signs of extending beyond just technology.The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index set a closing record last week for the first time in two years. The gauge gives an equal share to each constituent, rather than weighting by market capitalization.The share of S&P 500 stocks at all-time highs in the past month has risen, reaching the highest since early 2022, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Gillian Wolff show.Even so, less than a third of stocks are at records, “leaving plenty of room” for the bull market to gather participants, they said in a note.In contrast, by the time the tech bubble was about to burst in early 2000, the ratio of stocks at historic levels was waning, from around 60% at one point in 1997 to 20% at the turn of the century, the strategists wrote.IPO BluesInvestors’ limited appetite for new listings is another indicator that sentiment is short of the kind of euphoria typically seen around bubbles.In 1999, about 42% of US IPOs that raised more than $100 million saw share prices pop 50% or more through the close of the first day of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In 2024, only one — CG Oncology Inc. — has met that criteria.The US IPO market raised about $89 billion in 1999. While the market saw record business in 2021, it’s hit a wall since. There have been 36 IPOs in the US this year, raising $7.2 billion. In 2021, companies generated roughly $300 billion from around 1,000 deals.Valuations ComparedRobust profits from some of the tech behemoths have also brought down sky-high valuations. They remain relatively stretched, but they’re still well below prior peaks.The Magnificent Seven stocks, for example, trade near their average price-to-earnings ratio since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.And take the largest five S&P 500 stocks today. They trade at less than half the multiples of the top stocks in early 2000 — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell — a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis shows.Valuations are also contained across tech shares in areas including AI and robotics, with most of those baskets at or below their five-year average for price-to-sales multiples, according to BI.--With assistance from Elena Popina, Jessica Menton and Bailey Lipschultz.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/bubble-angst-belied-big-tech-120000734.html
2024-03-10 11:00:00+00:00,"6 Dividend Stocks Make Up 78.4% of Warren Buffett's $370 Billion Portfolio, and They Are All Cheaper Than the S&P 500","Famed investor Warren Buffett is known for finding quality businesses at a good value and holding them over time. When his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) first began investing in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, that stock traded at a steep discount to the market -- with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the range of 10 to 14.5 that year. Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today.A lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500.Berkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500. Combined with Apple, these six companies make up 78.4% of Berkshire's portfolio.Let's consider why Buffett and his team like these companies, and the qualities that make them good long-term holdings.In Berkshire Hathaway's most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett praised his longtime partner Charlie Munger for many things, including a key lesson he taught Buffett.Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ""Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.""Back then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.Berkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift. Apple is the undisputed leader in smartphones, consumer electronics, and wearable devices, and offers a wide range of services, many with high margins.Bank of America is the second-largest diversified bank behind JPMorgan Chase.American Express is a top credit card company, along with Mastercard and Visa (which Berkshire also owns shares in).Coca-Cola is the most valuable U.S.-based beverage company.Chevron is the second-biggest U.S.-based oil major, behind ExxonMobil. And Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, is one of the most valuable exploration and production companies and, assuming its deal with CrownRock L.P. goes through, will become one of the top producers in the Permian Basin -- the largest onshore oilfield in the U.S.In sum, Berkshire's biggest stock holdings are all among the top dogs in their respective industries. Many of them have another attribute that Buffett loves -- capital return programs.Over the last five years, Apple, Bank of America, and American Express have all boosted their dividends and bought back stock at impressive rates.Coke and Chevron have focused primarily on growing their dividends. Both have increased their payouts by more than 50% in the last 10 years. And Chevron has bought back a boatload of stock over the last two years. In 2023 alone, it spent a record $26 billion on dividends and buybacks.Occidental Petroleum is a bit of an outlier. In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since raised its quarterly payout several times, bringing it up to $0.22 per share, but it hasn't been exactly the type of consistent dividend payer Berkshire usually targets.Oxy is also known for using debt and leveraging up its balance sheet, which it will do to pay for its pending CrownRock acquisition.In Berkshire's 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett praised Oxy's leadership and wrote of his confidence in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Oxy stands out as a specific play on a specific theme. It amounts to 4.1% of the public equity portfolio, indicating that Berkshire is taking care to manage the position to make sure it doesn't become too large.You may be wondering, if these companies all have qualities that make them suitable investments, then why would they trade at a discount to the market? Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.Financial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.As for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei. So its valuation has come under pressure as investors search for companies that are growing in the near term.Berkshire's largest stock holdings showcase its highest-conviction names. Berkshire has owned some of these stocks for decades. Others, like Apple, Chevron, and Oxy, are more recent additions to the portfolio.The key takeaway is that Berkshire knows what it is looking for, and targets companies that fit its criteria -- not simply those that are tied to whichever hot trend is sweeping Wall Street. Berkshire invests in companies that are good values and have attractive capital return programs through dividends and buybacks.As an individual investor, it's important to find the types of companies and sectors you like. It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance. Buffett has often said that Berkshire purposely keeps a massive cash position and is conservative with its investments, but that's because capital preservation and limiting downside risk are integral parts of his philosophy.If you have a high risk tolerance or are multiple decades away from retirement, taking on more risk could make sense for you. But only if you are comfortable with risk and have the patience to hold onto stocks through periods of volatility.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10 08:49:00+00:00,"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Hit All-Time Highs, but It Could Be Just the Beginning If These 3 Stocks Join the Rally","As the calendar turned to March, the market has wasted no time bidding stocks higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closing at all-time highs.As of March 1, the S&P 500 is up 7.7% year-to-date (YTD), and the Nasdaq is up 8.4%. It's been a great run, but some fear that the market won't be able to keep up the pace.At this stage in the rally, it is asking a lot from top leaders like Nvidia to continue carrying the market higher. With a 4.5% weighting in the S&P 500 and a year-to-date return of 66.2%, Nvidia alone has contributed a staggering three percentage points to the S&P 500's YTD return. Put another way, Nvidia is responsible for 39% of the S&P 500's YTD return.Nvidia could keep going up, or it could stall. But the good news is that Nvidia doesn't have to lead the market higher.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have all missed out on the market rally. In fact, all three growth stocks have actually lost value in 2024. Here's what each company needs to do to regain favor on Wall Street, and what it could mean for the broader market.The ""Magnificent Seven"" refers to seven of the largest tech-focused companies. Together they make up 28.8% of the S&P 500. But only four of those stocks are doing well this year.Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla make up a combined 11% of the S&P 500. If these stocks turn things around, it could help push the S&P 500 higher even if Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms trade sideways from here.Apple has arguably the best overall case for a turnaround. The valuation isn't bad, with Apple trading at a 27.9 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is coincidentally the exact same as the S&P 500.The main issue is slowing growth out of China and a perceived lack of innovation with iPhone upgrades. Investors want to see Apple incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its products. It has been noticeably absent from the AI-fueled market rally.Investors who have been following Apple for a while know that the company is not one to overpromise and underdeliver by pre-announcing something flashy to boost Wall Street sentiment. Rather, Apple will wait, let the market do what it wants, and wait to reveal a new product, acquisition, innovation, etc. until it is ready.Two dates to keep track of would be the 2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June and then the unveiling of the iPhone 16, which should be in September.Investors will want to see meaningful strides across Apple's product line and the company's ability to capitalize on AI. As for the quarterly figures, investors will look for improvements from China, ongoing services growth and high margins, and strength from North America and emerging markets.Apple's main product threat is Huawei's new smartphone, which is weighing on its performance out of China. But China in general is down right now. Apple's moat isn't eroding, and it has dealt with plenty of competition before.It's easy to get negative on Apple stock right now. And to be fair, the stock could face a lot of short-term pressure between now and June or September (or beyond if it fails to deliver). But Apple's business isn't necessarily doing bad, it just looks bad compared to the scorching hot growth of the rest of big tech.Alphabet is in a similar but rockier boat. With an 11% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Its tried and true search engine business is still the undisputed market leader, but there's concern it could face unexpected threats as the competition makes strides in AI.Alphabet recently came under pressure because its Gemini 1.5 model was an AI disaster. It just seems like Alphabet has been lagging behind the competition in a field that it was once thought to lead. Google search is a brilliant algorithm built upon decades of AI innovation, but Alphabet is struggling to monetize new AI products right now.Until Alphabet reinforces its search fortress and gives the market something to get excited about, the stock will probably remain under pressure. The good news is that Alphabet isn't expensive. It is, by far, the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading at a mere 24.5 P/E ratio.Tesla stands out as arguably more vulnerable than Apple and Alphabet. Apple and Alphabet are already decent valuations relative to the market. So the further they fall, the more they may be considered by value investors.Tesla doesn't have that advantage. It has a lofty 47 P/E ratio and a 63.3 forward P/E ratio, which means that analysts believe the next 12 months of earnings will be lower than the last 12 months. In other words, negative growth.Even Apple and Alphabet have lower forward P/E ratios than their current P/Es because they are still growing, even in the near term.Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are achieving incredible results. Toyota stock is hovering around an all-time high. A big part of the rally is the company's success with hybrid vehicles, which have become a core part of its business strategy and are contributing to margin expansion. Toyota now has a higher operating margin than Tesla, which casts doubt on the sustained growth of electric vehicles (EV), at least in the short term.Tesla is facing a slowdown in EV adoption and mounting competition. It has also failed to monetize AI in a big way through fully autonomous driving.Tesla is still the market leader in EVs. But right now it's basically only doing one thing well, while the rest of the market is catching up. For Tesla to justify its current valuation, it has to show more growth outside of EVs.I wouldn't go as far as to say the long-term investment thesis for Tesla has changed, but the company has a lot of challenges that don't seem to be going away anytime soon.It would be great for the broader market if Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla joined the rally. But for the reasons discussed, there doesn't seem to be a fundamental reason for that to happen anytime soon.All three companies are facing slowing growth and competition. However, they also have vast financial resources to unlock growth for patient investors. The more Apple and Alphabet fall, the more they look like value plays. When Tesla returns to growth or announces some game-changing stride in AI, the stock could also start to look more reasonable.This market rally is fueled by specific themes and growth, so it's understandable why Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla have been left out.But long-term investing isn't about hopping on whatever trend is working in the short-term, but rather ensuring the businesses you invest in have what it takes to compound earnings over time. Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla have a long growth runway and plenty of potential, but they are all in ""prove it"" mode as far as the market is concerned. Holding all three stocks seems perfectly reasonable right now. And if there's one in particular you believe can address the market's concerns, then it may be an excellent time to buy it while it's out of favor.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10 07:30:00+00:00,2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.However, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.Then, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.Despite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.So here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.Apple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.While declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.Moreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.The tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.However, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value.These are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.Apple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.A recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09 21:14:02+00:00,OpenAI’s success has put a huge target on its back,"OpenAI is the world’s hottest startup. It not only set the stage for the generative AI explosion thanks to the launch of its ChatGPT in November 2022, but it’s also powering Microsoft’s (MSFT) push into the space via a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that gives the tech giant a roughly 49% stake in the company’s for-profit subsidiary.The company is now valued as high as $86 billion, according to Bloomberg. And with its latest product, the generative AI video platform Sora, making waves, CEO Sam Altman and company are riding higher than ever.But OpenAI’s success has also put a massive target on its back. The company is facing a slew of headwinds ranging from lawsuits and government investigations to increasing competition from established players like Google. And some of those could pose an existential threat to OpenAI as it’s currently constituted.OpenAI’s latest trouble comes from a familiar place: co-founder Elon Musk. Last week, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against the generative AI company claiming it is in breach of contract. Musk claims in the suit that OpenAI is in violation of its founding agreement by using its technology to grow its for-profit arm rather than for the benefit of humanity.Musk wants OpenAI to make all of its technologies public and to prevent it from making any money for Microsoft, which uses OpenAI’s models for its various AI Copilot offerings. After helping to found OpenAI in 2015, Musk left the company in 2018 over disagreements about the company’s future and, last year, founded an AI company of his own called x.AI.The New York Times is also suing OpenAI as well as Microsoft, claiming that the companies are benefiting from the use of the Times’ copyrighted material. The Times says OpenAI used its content without permission to train its models, which now benefits the company and Microsoft. The Times wants OpenAI to destroy any content from models trained using its materials.The paper isn’t the only media company looking to take on OpenAI. The Intercept, Raw Story, and AlterNet are also suing the firm, saying it used their data to train its models. The organizations are seeking damages and calling on OpenAI to delete any training data “from which author, title, copyright, and terms of use information was removed.”Removing training data from OpenAI’s large language models could impact their overall performance.OpenAI is also facing regulatory scrutiny in the US and abroad. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the midst of a probe into whether or not OpenAI misled investors. The inquiry followed the OpenAI board’s decision to fire Altman in November, saying he hadn’t been consistently candid with its members. OpenAI rehired Altman less than two weeks after he was removed.The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into OpenAI and its dealings with Microsoft, as well as those of its rivals, as the entity examines the potential impact of major cloud providers investing heavily in generative AI companies. The FTC is looking at Amazon and Google’s investments in OpenAI competitor Anthropic.Overseas, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is seeking comments from the public with regards to whether OpenAI and Microsoft’s deal should be considered a relevant merger situation and what kind of impact that will have on competition in the market.The European Commission, meanwhile, is looking into whether Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship is reviewable under the EU’s Merger Regulation.OpenAI is also staring down increasing competition from some of its biggest rivals. On Monday, Anthropic announced its Claude 3 family of large language models. According to the company, its largest model, Claude 3 Opus, can take on OpenAI’s GPT-4.Google (GOOG, GOOGL) also aims to take on OpenAI with its Gemini family of models. But the company flubbed the rollout of its Gemini image generator and pulled it off the market pending an update.Apple (AAPL) is also looking to get into the generative AI market, with Tim Cook saying that the company is investing heavily in the technology. And while Apple is unlikely to launch an enterprise generative AI model to directly rival OpenAI’s GPT offerings, it could reveal on-device generative AI capabilities that will draw consumers’ attention away from ChatGPT and its ilk.However, OpenAI’s challenges aren’t necessarily signs that the company is in any immediate danger. Lawsuits and regulatory actions can take years to wind their way through the courts if they even get that far. And with Microsoft in its corner, the company has an enormous war chest to pull from to fund its research into larger, more powerful AI models. But with the company sitting at the top of the AI mountain at the moment, it’s sure to face more challenges in the future.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-09 20:30:00+00:00,EV Stocks Are Dropping Like Flies – This “Bug” Is Still Worth Looking At,"Hello, Reader.A once-mighty Titan has fallen.No, not one of the pre-Olympian gods defeated by Zeus and his friends during the “Titanomachy”…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNor the monster “Kraken” from the 1981 film Clash of the Titans…It’s Apple’s electric vehicle aspiration, Project Titan. Through Project Titan, Apple Inc. (AAPL) sought to create an electric vehicle with AI-equipped features and self-driving capabilities. While rumors abounded, the company kept the details well-hidden since the project launched in 2014. Development picked up in 2018, but then finally ran into wall last week.Like the builders of the Titanic, Apple probably tempted fate by naming its EV project after an immortal deity. Project Titan perished after just ten years.Apple, itself, may be a true titan, but not a miracle-worker. The EV industry is claiming many victims these days. Earnings and revenue are declining at Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and the share prices of former EV hopefuls like Nikola Corp. (NKLA), Canoo Inc. (GOEV), and Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) are sliding into a ditch. Suffice to say, it’s becoming more and more difficult to find quality EV opportunities. Electric vehicles remain an unstoppable trend, however, and continue to provide investment opportunities.That’s why I’m sticking with my top pick in the EV space.In today’s Smart Money, I’ll take a look at why I still like this company as an EV play today…And at another EV-themed investment that may have even greater profit potential…The company – Volkswagen AG (VWAGY) – makes no secret of its ambition to become the world’s preeminent EV company… and it is making rapid progress toward that goal.The ID.4 SUV, VW’s first-ever U.S.-made battery electric vehicle (BEV), was the first fruit of the legendary German automaker’s ambitious expansion plans in the U.S. market. The company expects 55% of U.S. sales to be fully electric by 2030.Over the next five years, Volkswagen plans to invest a hefty $76 billion in global EV production and battery technology, including $7 billion to expand U.S. production and $17 billion to expand its market-leading presence in China. No other major automaker – no less the likes of Nikola or Rivian – is spending close to that amount. Volkswagen is also investing heavily to develop an open fast-charging network worldwide. By 2025, the company and its partners expect to install 45,000 High Power Charging points in Europe, China, and the United States.Last year, the Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, Porsche and a few other brands, sold a record 771,000 BEVs last year – 35% more than it sold in 2022. That figure represented just 8.3% of its total car sales. So, plenty of room for growth remains.Looking further down the road, Volkswagen believes software-based services will generate one-third of revenues in the global mobility market by 2030. For this reason, it is developing proprietary software expertise.As the company explains…Over the coming years, the Group’s own software and technology company CARIAD will develop the new E3 2.0 software platform for all Group vehicles and thus exploit synergy effects across all the brands… The new software architecture enables a complete ecosystem, which will offer customers a host of software-based services throughout the full product life cycle. By 2030, the Volkswagen Group will put up to 40 million of its cars based on the new software stack on the streets of this world. The Group will have the largest amount of real-time data in the whole industry – and continuously improve its products on this basis.Volkswagen’s grand BEV ambitions are not merely an attempt to transition successfully to the next phase of human mobility. They are also an attempt to establish a new phase of robust profitability for the company.Volkswagen is also heartily investing in battery technology to gain an advantage over its rivals.In July 2022, the company created PowerCo, a 100%-owned subsidiary, to produce battery components in European factories. The company’s aim is to manage the entire process, “From processing raw materials to developing a unified Volkswagen battery to managing the European gigafactories.” Lithium is, of course, one of the main raw materials that lithium-ion EV batteries require.This is why a recent discovery in Nevada –an ancient supervolcano holding a vast quantity of lithium – could become a vital cog in the global EV supply chain.Early reports suggest that the rich sediment from the supervolcano’s eruption millions of years ago could hold enough lithium to last 100 years at current projections… and enough to potentially be worth $1 trillion, an opportunity that could produce a major investment opportunity.Click here to find out the company that is set to profit from this discovery.Regards,Eric FryP.S.

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever. The equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape. Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26: ""As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”To benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology We referred to long-term hedge funds that rarely buy and sell stocks, then found 13 stocks that they have held consistently for at least 10 years. These are the best stocks to buy and hold forever. These hedge funds include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant company operating in the United States and globally. It operates through three segments – Wendy's U.S., Wendy's International, and Global Real Estate & Development. On February 15, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of March 1. It is one of the best stocks to buy. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 31.4 million shares worth $613 million. Trian Partners has held a stake in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) consistently since 2013. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best stocks to buy.Oakmark Equity and Income Fund made the following comment about The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)’s is the second-largest quick-service burger chain in the U.S. This iconic brand generates $13.3 billion of systemwide sales from 7,095 restaurant locations around the world. Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a global risk assessment firm with two main segments – Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. The company provides institutional risk management, credit research and structured finance solutions, credit ratings, and assessment services for debt obligations and entities. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) declared a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is payable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of February 23. On February 5, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authority.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 58 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 24.6 million shares worth $9.6 billion. L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.We continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.The Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.The share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyze Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the American multinational beverage giant, is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15. The company’s revenue in Q4 2023 increased 7% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $150 million. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $23.5 billion. Hayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products. The company operates through four segments – U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services, International Card Services, and Global Merchant and Network Services. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provided optimistic guidance for 2024, surpassing analyst expectations, despite the Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue falling short of estimates. American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration. The projected 2024 EPS is between $12.65 and $13.15, exceeding the consensus estimate of $12.30, with an anticipated revenue growth of 9%-11%. This guidance implies a 2024 revenue range of $66.0 billion to $67.2 billion, compared to the consensus of $66.2 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 74 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $28.4 billion. In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of human health products, including oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and vaccine products. The Animal Health segment focuses on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and health management solutions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03 and a revenue of $14.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.14 and $120 million, respectively.According to Insider Monkey's fourth quarter database, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was part of 98 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 85 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $1.5 billion.Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading manufacturer and provider of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices. TSMC ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a Q4 GAAP EPADR of $1.44 and a revenue of $19.62 billion, outperforming Wall Street expectations by $0.05 and $50 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 105 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 107 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 31 million shares worth $3.2 billion. Baron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the fourth quarter due to investor expectations for a cyclical recovery in semiconductors heading into 2024 and significant incremental demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company with operations worldwide. It operates through Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. On January 30, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, in line with market consensus. The revenue increased 10.7% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $60 million. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 120 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.8 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever. Jackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.5 million shares worth $174.3 billion. Horizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.  Suggested articles:12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to AvoidJim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024 Disclosure: None. 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/13-best-stocks-buy-hold-175854400.html
2024-03-09 15:15:00+00:00,Will Apple Be a $3 Trillion Stock by 2025?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) became the world's first $3 trillion company last June. By Dec. 14, 2023, its stock had hit its record high of $197.86, lifting its market cap to $3.08 trillion and seemingly securing its spot as the world's most valuable company.But today Apple's stock trades at about $170 per share with a market cap of $2.63 trillion. Microsoft, which surpassed that market cap this January, is now worth $2.99 trillion. Let's see why Apple lost its luster over the past three months, if it can regain its footing this year, and if it can become a $3 trillion stock again by 2025.The bulls abandoned Apple this year for four simple reasons. First, its sales of iPhones -- which accounted for 58% of its top line in its latest quarter -- are slowing down. Its iPhone sales dipped 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) and only grew 6% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended.Competitive and macro headwinds in China exacerbated that slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 24% year over year in the first six weeks of 2024 amid stiff competition from Huawei.Second, Apple couldn't offset that slowdown by selling its other products. Its Mac sales fell 27% in fiscal 2023 amid the broader PC market's slowdown, then rose less than 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Its sales of iPads slumped during both periods, its Apple Watch sales were temporarily halted last December amid a patent dispute, and the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget for tech enthusiasts. It also recently abandoned its decade-long plans to build an electric car. As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 1% and 7%, respectively, this year.Third, Apple's valuations were inflated by a flight toward safe-haven stocks as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds rattled the market. Even after its year-to-date decline, Apple's stock still doesn't look like a bargain at 26 times forward earnings -- and its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.6% probably won't limit its downside potential.Lastly, the European Commission recently hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine for banning streaming music rivals like Spotify Technology from informing its users of cheaper payment options outside of its App Store. Apple can easily pay that fine, but it could pave the way toward a broader crackdown on its entire services segment -- which serves more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is often cited as a catalyst for its long-term growth.Apple's near-term future is murky. During its shareholder meeting in late February, CEO Tim Cook claimed Apple would ""break new ground"" in generative artificial intelligence (AI) this year -- but that statement sounded like an eleventh-hour attempt to hop aboard the AI bandwagon that had previously driven Microsoft's stock to its record highs. Apple reportedly plans to add new generative AI features to Spotlight, its integrated search tool for Siri and iOS, but it's unclear if those upgrades will meaningfully widen its moat against Microsoft's Copilot and Alphabet's Google Assistant.If Apple's AI plans fail to meaningfully boost its sales over the next few quarters, its stock could lose its premium valuation and be revalued relative to its near-term growth potential. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to only grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 8%.For reference, IBM -- which is growing again as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at CAGRs of 4% and 6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2026. Based on those expectations, IBM trades at just 22 times this year's earnings. It also pays a much higher forward yield of 3.4%.If Apple is also revalued at 22 times forward earnings, its stock would drop another 15% to the mid-$140s, reducing its market cap to $2.2 trillion. So unless Apple can pull a few rabbits out of its hat, it probably won't impress the bulls and regain its $3 trillion valuation by the beginning of 2025. But over the long term Apple could still get its act together as it rolls out new products and services -- so it's still too early to write it off as a mature tech giant that has run out of room to grow.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now.It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool, senior analyst, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. Fellas, great to have you both here.Matthew Argersinger: Hey, Dylan.Dylan Lewis: We've got earnings updates, a breakdown on the two most dreaded words in pharmaceuticals and, of course, stocks on our radar. But we're going to kick off today focusing on three different updates in the race for AI. First up, this week, Elon Musk filed suit against OpenAI and it's leader, Sam Altman. Musk famously helped found OpenAI in 2015 and Matt, his suit centers on the idea that OpenAI was originally founded to be a non-profit and mission oriented toward, ideally maybe AI help humanity. We've seen it pivot now to more of a private enterprise. What are you paying attention to at this case?Matthew Argersinger: I think this is a big deal and I think Musk has a pretty good case [laughs] and I would say the implications could be pretty stark for really the whole AI landscape. If you think about it, OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. I think most analysts, investors would probably point to that day as the day that the AI revolution started. Maybe Nvidia's first-quarter results in 2023, another milestone, but clearly when ChatGPT came out, it was big deal. If you just look for a second, at the stock price of Microsoft since that day, since November 30, 2022. Remember Microsoft invested one billion dollars in OpenAI in 2019 and has been pivoting it to a more commercially viable for profit platform. Since November 30, 2022, the share price of Microsoft is up more than 60%. Over that period of time, it's added more than one trillion [laughs] in market cap to its valuation. Now, granted, not all that can be true and attributed to OpenAI, but I think a bunch of it certainly is, I think the excitement around AI and with the idea that Microsoft is now because of its investment, a leader in this new market, it's a big deal. I think the one of the reasons Microsoft trades for 37 times earnings today, or something like Alphabet trades for 20 times earnings. This disparity there I think is because of what investors are ascribing to the value of AI that Microsoft has. Just imagine for a second, if Musk succeeds in his lawsuit, suddenly the commercial implications of Microsoft investment and OpenAI itself goes away. I just think this has enormous implications, not just for Microsoft or the generative AI industry today, but really for the development and evolution of AI as we go forward from here.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, the ramifications seem crazy and wild and things we're going have to figure out over time. I think one of the things that's fascinating about it too, is we're not legal scholars by any stretch, Matt. But there have been a lot of behind the scenes drama with OpenAI. We saw Sam Altman seemingly leave the company and come back in a very short period. We may, through the process of discovery and this case, learn a little bit more about what's been going on at OpenAI.Matthew Argersinger: Absolutely. More information, more transparency is going to come out of this whole period that we've been only reading the headlines, but now we'll get to really understand what's happening and in a way it's going to hurt Microsoft and OpenAI because all this stuff is going to be out in the open for competitors like Alphabet, maybe Apple down the road. We'll talk about to understand exactly how they compete better with this platform.Dylan Lewis: Speaking of Alphabet, also in the news in AI this week, Google's Gemini generative AI tool ran into issues with image and text generation. A lot of headlines this week, as users noted, Gemini declined to produce images depicting people of certain races, struggled to depict certain specific figures correctly confusing some of the racial and gender identities also had some controversy with its text-generation tool, leading to some offensive and problematic output. Jason, this is a new tool and I think we can zoom in on the Gemini specific part of the story, but we can talk broadly here about generative AI. Do you feel like some of these headlines and some of the instances that we're seeing out here are just the growing pains that you'd expect to see with the new technology?Jason Moser: To an extent, yes. Anytime a new technology like this is introduced, you have to go into an understanding it's going to take a long time to develop and have to learn essentially really the true used cases for it and how it's going to make us in society better. You have to expect some growing pains now. With that said, I would be concerned. This was a real eye-opener. Some of the stuff that this thing was spitting out was laughable, it was really just totally off the wall. We know that a lot of these large language models suffer from hallucinations, spitting out wrong information. I think with AI, one of the ideas behind it, it's supposed to make our lives more efficient, we can get work done more quickly, things will be more accurate. We're not quite there yet. We have a society generally speaking, there's still somewhat skeptical of this. There's Pew Research, I've quoted this several months back, but there's Pew Research overall that says that 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about the increased use of artificial intelligence. Just 10% say they are more excited than concerned and 36% say there's a mix of emotions right now. I don't think things like this help people feel more excited. No, not at all. There's that problem in winning the people over, so to speak. But then for Alphabet specifically, I think this becomes a bigger issue because, I think probably all of us here at this table would agree that Google is seen as a laggard in AI right now, a company that has not quite kept up with the others in the space. There is some reputational risks that comes with this. These types of mistakes, it can run the risk of sending people fleeing and never wanting to come back.Dylan Lewis: Yeah and Jason, this is not the first misstep we've seen. It's fairly high-profile misstep we've seen from Google's AI ambitions. They put out what was a fairly impressive demo of their AI results. I think that was as they were transitioning Bard over to Gemini. We later found out that demo was somewhat faked or edited a little bit so that the experience was cleaner, which led to a lot of controversy. It seems like not only are they a laggard in the space, but I look at the businesses of big tech and I think they are probably one of the companies that most needs to be getting things right in the zone.Jason Moser: It feels that way. I tell you, it really speaks to I think the human element that's involved with all of this. This is all something that is ultimately born from people building these machines, these models, and letting these models feed off themselves and learn from themselves. The big question is floating around is Sundar Pichai, the guy to lead this company forward? He is absolutely on the hot seat here. There are questions of Google and Alphabet's culture. Is this something that he can fix? That question, I think will remain for some time to come. I really wouldn't be surprised, they went from Bard rebranded a Gemini. I really feel like they're going to have to rebrand from Gemini. They really tarnished that name Gemini because I think for most people now when they see Gemini, they hear that word or they see that brand, their mind's not going to a good place. It's just really difficult to get that back. It's not to say they can't, but they were already behind. It's really going to take a lot of work to get back to where they need to be.Dylan Lewis: Our final AI-ish story this week. After over a decade of work, Apple is ending its vehicle ambitions. Those working on the company's very secretive project Titan Initiative will be shifted over to Apple's AI division. Jason, this is kind of an AI story, it's also kind of a car story. Why don't we take the car angle here first? Are you surprised that we never got to see an Apple car?Jason Moser: Not really. It always stood out to me is a little bit odd that they would really do that. But then it's Apple. This is one of the most important businesses in the world, they should be trying this stuff. If they tried it and felt like the juice wasn't worth the squeeze and I credit them for going ahead and just backing out. Now the one question I posed earlier in the week, because I think this is an interesting way to look at this. We've seen recently out, EVs are under fire. Hybrids are getting a little bit more of the headlines share right now, and Gas Guzzlers are on the rise as well. How does this make Elon Musk feel? Because, of course, some would say, hey, this is great, that's one less competitor in the space. The flip side of that is, Apple's looking at that and saying, well maybe he's just really isn't worth our time and money because they feel like that EV opportunity is somewhat capped, at least in the near-term. I don't know the answer to that, but generally speaking, I think this makes a lot of sense. It just doesn't feel like it was something that was really in Apple's core proficiency.Matthew Argersinger: I'm having trouble buying your argument that Apple was too far behind. Then you're seeing that argument that they're too far behind it, really designed to create EV. Were they too far behind BlackBerry or Nokia when they came out with the iPhone [laughs] 15 years, 16 years ago? I just think they might have looked at a little bit at the landscape. Competition from China in the long run, extremely hard to compete against. With the low cost manufacturers that they have in that country. It's also a little bit to Jason's point, it's like the infrastructure out there for EVs is very poor right now. I know this is an EV owner. Try to do a road trip in the cold in the winter but more than four hours. Good luck. I think Apple might've said we could design a great car. It's just not the right landscape right now. It's just the environment is not going to fit with the quality of the car that we want to bring to the market.Dylan Lewis: Jason, very few companies could afford to spend about a decade and $10 billion on a project that never winds up going anywhere. Was the car part of any of the Apple thesis for you in your head?Jason Moser: No, never was. Honestly, $10 billion for a company like that.Dylan Lewis: How much did Zuckerberg spend on the Metaverse?Jason Moser: He's still spending that. I think we're all still asking the question as to whether that's actually going to be worth it. If you have Apple thrown out the Vision Pro there, which is raising a lot of questions right now and they follow that up with a car. Then all of a sudden maybe you've got a disturbing trend where this company that's been changing our lives for so long. Now, maybe they're on this losing streak and I know they don't want to be on that, so it feels like this was the right call, so you appreciate the discipline there.Dylan Lewis: No question. Coming up after the break, we've got an earnings rundown and a new buzzword in tech. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined in studio by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. The beat is on for earnings season. We've got updates from Okta, Axon, and Salesforce to run through. Jason, let's start with Axon. A great week for the company and might I add my portfolio shake-up, 13% after the body camera and Taser maker posted earnings. Strong results from the company and it seems like the good times just continue for Axon.Jason Moser: But I feel like, well all three-year shareholders here.Dylan Lewis: Absolutely.Jason Moser: I think they're going to need to change their mission from to protect life to protect life and portfolios [laughs] because they clearly are doing a very good job at both. This is a company that just continues to fire on all cylinders, they say. Revenue $432 million exceeded their own expectations up close to 29% from a year ago. Really driven by strong demand across all product categories. The Cloud software continues to really perform. You look at net revenue retention, 122%. They do such a good job of keeping their customers and upselling, innovating new devices, and whatnot. Ultimately, we saw Non-GAAP earnings per share $1.12 up from $0.70 a year ago. An annual recurring revenue grew 47% from a year to $697 million. Again, driven by that Axon Cloud software growth.Dylan Lewis: Jason, the stock is now at all-time high and shares are up I think more than fivefold over the last five years. I've enjoyed that climb. You mentioned the Cloud segment and that has been a really big part of what's been pushing this company forward. Do you feel like there's still plenty of growth ahead?Jason Moser: I do. Once they get those devices out there, the Cloud and services revenue is what keeps their customers locked in there. We saw that revenue growth of 44% for the quarter really just demonstrates that. Then I think ultimately they're guiding for 20% plus top-line growth here for the foreseeable future based on that installed base and the innovations they continue to make on that software side. Along the way with a couple of little bolt-on acquisitions, they've now raised their total addressable market from $50 billion to $63 billion. Which the company that's really just generating a couple of billion dollars revenue right now. You can see the opportunity that's out there. I just don't think that need for public safety is going to go anywhere anytime soon.Dylan Lewis: All right Matt, before the break, a tease. We've got a new buzzword in tech. It popped up in Salesforce's quarterly update and that's dividend.Matthew Argersinger: Yes. Salesforce, not a business I follow closely but just look at the results first. I mean, really impressed by the operating leverage in this business. 11% revenue growth turns into 51% operating profit growth, pretty impressive. Even though top-line growth is expected to slow this fiscal year to 9%, we're still targeting 45% increase and earnings per share. But you said the word dividends, which of course got me excited. Salesforce is going to pay its first dividend, $0.40 per share per quarter. This of course follows in the footsteps of Meta Platforms. Dividends are apparently the new hotness in Silicon Valley and I like it. What I don't like though guys, is the fact that more often than not, these dividend announcements seem to be initiations are in conjunction with or even second-fiddle really two big new buybacks. To use Salesforce as an example, they just announced a $10,000,000,000 increase in their repurchases. Last year, the company spent 7.6 billion buying back their stock. Guess what happened to Salesforces diluted share count? It went from 984 million a year ago to, drum roll please, 983 million at the end of last quarter. What is that? 0.01% maybe?Dylan Lewis: Slight reduction.Matthew Argersinger: Yeah in the consulate. Like most big tech and software companies, they're spending billions of dollars just to offset the dilution from new stock issuance. I just think at especially at these valuations today, to be doing these buybacks, crying out loud, NVIDIA is doing buybacks. I love the dividend part. I just wish less was being spent on buybacks, more on the dividend, focus on cost cutting and taking away a lot of that dilutive share issuance and just pay more dividends.Dylan Lewis: Jason, as Matt mentioned, Salesforce following in the footsteps of Meta initiating a dividend, do you think we might see more big tech companies, maybe companies that hadn't considered dividend policies in the past, start to think twice about that?Jason Moser: Well, we've been talking for a while about Alphabet possibly doing something like this given their recent missteps, I got to believe that's probably not the number one priority right now. Alphabet's one with the same thing. They issue so many shares. The buybacks just are not bringing that countdown like we'd like to see and the top it all off, no dividend. A company that generates this kind of cash with that kind of balance sheet, it feels like a great opportunity to do it.Dylan Lewis: It would change the narrative right now, which they could use.Jason Moser: Obviously, Berkshire Hathaway, same argument, obviously, much different company. But it does feel like these big companies are a little bit more under fire right now to return a little bit more to shareholders.Dylan Lewis: We'll wrap our earnings run down with a look at Okta. Shares up 20% after the security, an identity management company reported. This was a business that had some bad news a little while ago, Jason, but it seems like they've been able to shift the narrative and get back on track.Jason Moser: Yeah, this was really a nice bounce-back quarter for the company. They've been dealing with some headwinds here over the last several months, a recent security breach. I'm sure most people know about and left a few questions out there but it seems like they've gotten back down brass tax, starting to win back the trust. My philosophy with these types of companies, it's not if there is some sort of security breach, it's a matter of when and then it's a matter of how they handle it, and what lessons they learn from recovery. Let's hope that they've taken away some good lessons and they've recovered nicely from this. It seems like based on the metrics that things are going in the right direction. Subscription revenue was up 20% of $591 million. Remaining performance obligations grew to 13% and the balance sheet remains in terrific shape. Some of the other metrics, they grew total customers to 18,950. That's up from 17,600 a year ago. I will say to be fair, customer acquisition right now, that's something that's slowed them down a little bit. Management is tweaking their go-to-market model a little bit. It gives teams a little bit more specific focus on either acquisition or upsell. I think there's an opportunity there based on the model there. There's a 111% in dollar-based net retention rate down not surprisingly, from 120% a year ago, as enterprises out there continued to be very mindful of their spending. But Okta really is one of those mission-critical style businesses that once companies start using and then they expand that identity protection portfolio of services, it becomes a little bit more difficult to extract yourself from that, so customers tend to stick with them for a while.Dylan Lewis: That's as-a-service at its best, right?Jason Moser: There you go.Dylan Lewis: We are most of the way through earnings season. We still have some companies coming up. But Matt, I'm curious, any surprises or anything you're still looking forward to this season?Matthew Argersinger: Not really. Overall, I think it's been a pretty strong earning season I have to say. I would point to some of the [inaudible] I tend to talk about on the show. Just having done really well and still trading for just incredibly low valuation. If you're looking for opportunities of stocks that haven't really bounced, you want to check that out.Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser. Fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we've got to dive into the world of pharma and patent cliffs. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Over the past few years, the pharma industry has been front-and-center, bringing incredible innovations to market at warp speed but if you're interested in buying pharma stocks, there's a lot to learn. In this week's interview segment, Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with analyst Karl Thiel about the role of patents in pharmaceuticals and the dreaded patent cliff looming for roughly 200 big-time drugs over the next decade.Deidre Woollard: In simple terms, as I understand it, patent cliff is simply when the value of a drug that a company develops plummets when it goes off patent. But I understand that that's a simplification so tell us a little bit more about how patents work in the pharmaceutical space.Karl Thiel: Well, no. That's not a simplification. That's absolutely what it is. Drugs are protected by patents. In some ways, the drug industry is the poster child for why patents exist. They spend sometimes well over a billion dollars to develop a drug. It takes over a decade to do it and so in order to take on that risk, they are rewarded with exclusivity. Nobody can compete with that specific drug for a period of time. That period of time is 20 years. That's how it's been since 1994. It has changed over the decades but you get 20 years of exclusivity from when you file your patent. After that, generics can enter and the benefit for society then is that the price of that drug should plummet. It should become very affordable to everybody.Deidre Woollard: That's interesting because there's examples. Pfizer and Lipitor is the big example. In 2011, the sales fell by over 80%. But is it always a cliff like that where they sell right up until the date and then it just falls off like that?Karl Thiel: Well, they will absolutely [laughs] sell up until the date. They will get every dollar that they can out of the drug while it's exclusive. And then is it always a cliff? That's a really interesting question and it's going to become increasingly relevant in the next half decade or so. There's different kinds of drugs out there and you talked about Lipitor, which is a drug that a lot of people are familiar with. It's a pill. It's what's called in the industry, a small molecule. Which means that it's got a relatively simple chemical structure that should be something that another company can formulate and make essentially exactly the same way as the original company. And so you get a generic version. Generic Lipitor should be exactly identical to the Lipitor Pfizer made. They should be interchangeable products. For that reason, when it suddenly becomes available and cheaper, prices tend to plummet. It's not unusual for an innovator drug to lose 90% of its market share often quite quickly. I think Lipitor lost 70% of its markets within the first six months. They were considered quite innovative at the time for all the things they did to protect that market but that's how it went. What's different is that a lot of drugs these days are biologicals.They're the fruits of the biotech industry and they are things like monoclonal antibodies and peptide drugs and cell therapies and things that are very difficult to manufacture. If you look at the chemical structure of them, they're insanely complicated. They're not drugs that you whip up in a chemistry lab, they're drugs that you grow in a vat. Something like a monoclonal antibody is this huge molecule with all these amino acids wrapped up in a certain way and those amino acids get decorated with little sugars on the outside in a process called glycosylation. The upshot is that you can never guarantee that anyone else can make a product that is identical to that. That's why when ''generic biologic'' doesn't exist they're called biosimilars. They're called biosimilars because they are presumed to be similar to the original product but they're not the same. Because of that, the market's just developed a little bit differently.One thing is that you can't just say look, our chemical is the same as this chemical so let us sell it. You have to do some level of clinical studies to at least show that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as it's known, are similar to your drug, that your drug acts like the other drug. You have to do some studies. What you end up happening is much fewer competitors and often not quite as much of a price decrease. That is a big difference with what a patent cliff. Biosimilars have been with us since 2009, we're about 15 years into it since the Affordable Care Act first introduced the mechanism. For a lot of the history biosimilars have not caught on all that much. You've tended to have the original innovators still keep a lot of their market. You haven't seen prices come down as much as you expect. But that may be starting to change and that's going to be critical in the next few years.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. As I understand it, if I'm making a drug like Lipitor and I just want to make a generic, it's relatively easy but if I want to make a duplicate of the biosimilar, it's much more complicated now. You mentioned the studies, do they have to go through a separate FDA approval, or is it because it's already approved they can circumvent that process?Karl Thiel: It's a truncated process. It's much easier than creating a drug from scratch because it's already been proven that this particular approach will work and that's all been done in clinical trials. You can reference the innovator companies data but you do have to do some level of clinical work to prove that your drug is in fact acting like the original ones so it is a little bit more complicated. Part of the reason this is so important is if you look at a list of the top-selling drugs in the world right now, they are dominated by biologics. A few of them are small molecules but [laughs] they are dominated by biologics. People talk about a patent cliff so there is a big one [laughs] coming up between now and 2030. There's going to be something like 190 blockbuster drugs that are going to lose their exclusivity and they represent something like $236 billion in sales. I think somebody calculated. It's enormous, but a lot of them are biologics. In order for this all to work for society, we need to [laughs] have the process work, have these biosimilars come along, and have them actually be adopted and actually drive down prices for people. That's the idea behind this. We'll see what will happen.Deidre Woollard: Well, it's interesting because it sounds like with the previous process with just a single drug, doctors are going to feel confident, they're going to prescribe the generic. Why not? That's how things work. In this case, is there going to be any concern about those biosimilars? How will that work? Or do we really not know at this point?Karl Thiel: The biosimilars that have been approved, I think they're faithful. They should work just like the innovator drugs and I think most prescribers are probably comfortable with that. It's always possible that there is some individual out there who has some sensitivity to something. That's not the reason here. I'll tell you something, Deidre. HUMIRA, top-selling drug in the world, $21 billion in sales, beginning of 2023 had a biosimilar launched. Sorry, it peaked sales in 2022. Anyway, Amgen had the first biosimilar on the market. They launched two versions of it. One was priced at a 55% discount to AbbVie's price for HUMIRA and the other one was priced at a 5% discount. Which one do you think was more popular?Deidre Woollard: I would assume everyone's going for that 55%.Karl Thiel: So it was the 5% one that tended to be more popular because of the way [laughs] that these Things get paid for. Usually, these drugs go through pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs. PBMs can negotiate a bigger discount if they take the 5% discounted version and then negotiate a big discount on top of that and then pocket part of that. There's a lot of very strange parts of how our healthcare system works and a lot of it was some problem that came up 20 years ago and somebody solved it by sticking a piece of chewing gum there and now there's more wads of gum here and there. It's a very crufty system that often defies all sorts of logic, but that's one part of it. And I think that's a reason, I'm not saying that's the only reason, but that is a reason that biosimilars have been somewhat slow to catch on. Often on the face of it, you're like this isn't even much of a discount.Deidre Woollard: Well, when we were talking before the show, you mentioned that it may not be just one patent, but that there's all these different patents that can go into a particular drug, which makes determining when this clip is a little more complicated.Karl Thiel: So there's different kinds of patents. There is almost ever a single patent that rules the fate of a major drug. When a company realizes that it has a successful drug on their hands, they are gonna do everything they can to protect it. So the rocket Gibraltar is what's called the composition of matter patent, which is the patent that says, we've invented this chemical. It never existed before. This is plainly our invention and that's the patent. Those are very seldom with anybody even try to get around that patent, you just wait for it to run out. But there are lots of other ways [laughs] to patented a drug in to try to extend that life a little bit. So you'll often find that in what's called the FDA Orange Book, which collects all these Things, there can be hundreds of patents on a single product. So there will be an argument. So when a drug actually goes generic, so for instance, the drug Eliquis is one that's coming up. This is a drug that's an anticoagulant drug, it's used for Things like Afib and stuff like that. I believe their original patent expired in 2023. But they got it extended by the patent office, because you can do that in certain stack circumstances. That's one strategy you can use. They gathered extended because you can argue that, we filed but you took too long to issue where we lost time there; or you can say, FDA took too long to review the drug, we lost time there. So you can sometimes argue with the Patent Office to extend it. They extended it to 2026. But then you start this legal battle in which you say, look, that's that patent, but we have a whole bunch of other patents that we think protected out to X date and you start fighting it out in court. Usually what will happen is the generic manufacturers will settle and they'll come to some date where they say, OK, we all agree you can launch on this date. That way, we don't really have to determine whether these other patents aren't going to be enough to protect it or not. With Eliquis that happens to be April of 2028, which is when generics will launch. But you can argue that that's five-years too late.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. My mother ticks Eliquis, so I'm particularly interested in that one. So that's one way to extend the patent cliff and it seems like there's other strategies. I know one of the Things, some companies say they don't want to be in an area where there's going to be a lot of that generic competition, so they focus on certain diseases, maybe with a smaller market. Some of them they tried to put out another drug, almost a piggyback, so that they don't lose that revenue. What other kinds of strategies do you see in play there?Karl Thiel: Ideally, what a company tries to do is it has a drug that works for a certain disease and they tried to make a better one. Then everybody will switch to that hopefully because it's just a better drug. I would say a company like Gilead Sciences for instance, which is very much the leader in HIV treatment, has made its name in many ways about both improving drug's effectiveness but also just improving the convenience. So that's one thing you might do is like, hey, you'd probably don't want to take a pill three times a day, we've come up with a way to have just once a day pill. Sometimes you can say, well look, is the difference between some of these convenience factors such that this one should really be priced at 50 times this other one. But in fact, if you have insurance, you're often insulated from that and if you don't, you're often caught out by it. So it's a very complex and interesting situation, but certainly yeah.Coming up with different ways of delivering drugs, coming up with next-generation versions that work better or that maybe have fewer side effects, Things like that are all certainly legitimate strategies to try to keep your leadership in an area.Dylan Lewis: Motley Fool Money listeners, want more industry dives like this one? Let us know what you want to hear by shooting a snowed at radio@fool.com. Coming up next, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. So don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. We're going to get over to our radar stocks in a minute. But first, it was an up and down week for surge pricing and restaurant chain Wendy's, the company announced plans to test dynamic pricing, which was met with swift blowback. They later clarified that would not be using the surge pricing we might be familiar with, with Uber and some of the other ride-hailing companies when demand is high, but instead might test offering discounts during slower times of the day for customers. Jason, do you think we'll see more businesses play with dynamic pricing?Jason Moser: Probably. I mean, we probably will. There's clearly not the only company that has done that. I mean, we see a ride-sharing, I think is one that stands out or poor while surge pricing really play into the model. It feels to me like with restaurants, particularly fast food restaurants, it's probably not the best idea. I mean, it just seems to add a level of complexity that creates a bad experience for everyone, from the employee to the customer. You're talking about baconator arbitrage. Most people out there don't even know what I mean when I say that. But the fact of matter, I think it makes for a less-than-optimal experience for everyone and when it comes to restaurants, they're just a million substitutes out there. I mean, my Uber shows up and I got to get somewhere. I'm kind of stuck, I got to take the ride. Unless I want to wait another 30 minutes for a lift and they're going to do the same thing to me. But with restaurants, that's a little bit of a different story. You can just go across the street to the Mcdonald's or Burger King and maybe get that.Matthew Argersinger: I guess if you're a customer who values his or her time, I think it makes sense. Imagine like you look at your screen, Starbucks might be example, I get my afternoon coffee at 2 o'clock, I see that there's high demand right now and prices are high I'm going to hold off a bit. Maybe get my coffee at 3 o'clock and watch the app. Prices to go down, I'm I'm buying my latte. I think there's something to it.Jason Moser: As an economics major, I love it. I mean, supply demand, it really warrants, but from a customer experience, certain markets, I don't know that it creates the optimal experience and their goal is to keep people coming back.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, we'll see. Burger futures maybe in heart. Alright, let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Matt you are up first, what are you looking at?Matthew Argersinger: I am looking at eBay ticker, E-B-A-Y. A lot of investors presume that you have to have revenue growth for investments really worked out. But I think there are cases like eBay where you simply you get smart, shareholder-friendly capital allocation. Things can work out. I mean, no one's stealing eBay's growth. I mean, if you look at the most recent quarter, revenue was up just 2%, gross merchandise volume up just 2%, but GAAP earnings of 13.8%, and a big reason for that is buybacks. Ebay made 1.6 billion in share repurchases over the past year and unlike Salesforce, they actually reduce the share count by almost 5%. Over the last five years, eBay's reducing share count by over 40% and they raise their dividend again by 8% and the stock price got a nice bump and I think if eBay can just keeps sales steady, keep it's massive network of buyers and sellers and keep allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways, I think that it's an investment i could really work out. I'm a shareholder,.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about eBay.Dan Boyd: So Matt, you are a known comic book collector?Matthew Argersinger: I am.Dan Boyd: Do you ever use eBay?Matthew Argersinger: I use eBay all the time Dan, buying and selling. So I'm a big power user, but probably makes me biased.Dan Boyd: That's kind of the heyday of eBay in the '90s and early 2000s collectibles. That was a market for it.Dylan Lewis: Alright, Jason, what's on your radar this week?Jason Moser: I've been digging a little bit more into Palo Alto Networks. Ticker is P-A-N-W's. A Palo Alto is a cybersecurity company focused on delivering value in four fundamental areas; it's network security, cloud security, security operations, and then threat intelligence and security consulting. So they really are one of the cybersecurity companies that offers the whole kit and caboodle as they say. Now, I think it's interesting with the company they recently reported earnings, the stock got shellacked. Management pulled back on guidance for the year they cited in the call, I quote, spending fatigue. It's kind of like investments pricing. I mean, its just spending fatigue that raised some eyebrows. Again, it's not new news that enterprise customers are being more mindful of their spending. Cybersecurity is in a little bit of a different bucket, because that really is a non-negotiable, you got to have it this day and age and it's a very competitive space. It was interesting to me also to see Zscalers call a competitor to a degree of Palo Alto. Z-scalar kind of pushing back on that spending fatigue comment, noting they're not really seeing such spending fatigue, yet Zscaler's stock just got pummeled on that earnings release as well. So it could be a little bit of a downtime for the cybersecurity companies right now and in Palo Alto, $100 million market cap company, one that is very important in the space. So learning a little bit more about it and if it's gotta spot in one of my services.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Palo Alto Networks.Dan Boyd: Yeah, Jason, what does Palo Alto Networks doing being headquartered in Santa Clara? It is confusing, isn't it Dan? We really need to straighten them out. I'd imagine it has something to do with with taxes or some sort of little sweetener that the county or city gave them.Matthew Argersinger: Dan, which one's going on your list this week?Dan Boyd: I'm a big user of eBay too. I love buying motorcycle parts from them and with Palo Alto being headquartered in a place that isn't Palo Alto, I don't know if I can accept that kind of thing.Dylan Lewis: Dan doesn't like misrepresentation. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show's mixed by Dan. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

2024-03-09 13:55:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is being supercharged by the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).With the exception of Apple and Tesla, each of these AI stocks has handily beaten the S&P 500 over the last year. Nvidia stands out in a league of its own, however.The stock is up nearly 260% in the last year, and the company has added a trillion dollars of market cap in less than 12 months. With such a meteoric rise, investors may be thinking that they've missed the boat.Let's dig into the current state of Nvidia's business and, more importantly, take a look at what catalysts could be in store for future growth. Now could be as good a time as ever to begin building a position in this monster AI stock.Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) that are used across an array of generative AI applications, including accelerated computing and machine learning. Demand for the company's flagship A100 and H100 chips is staggering, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.Nvidia recently reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. For the full year, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue -- up 126% year over year. But what's even more encouraging is the company's margin expansion and profitability growth. In fiscal 2024, Nvidia's gross margin was 72.7% -- an increase of nearly 16 percentage points over the prior year. On top of that, the company's free cash flow of $27 billion surged sixfold year over year.With a financial performance like this, the music eventually has to stop, right? I wouldn't bank on that just yet.Despite Nvidia's record growth last year, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the ride could just be getting started.Nvidia is expected to increase its top line by roughly 78% this year, followed by modest growth over the next couple of years. Admittedly, forecasting beyond one year can be more of an art than a science. As an investor, I'm not placing too much credence on estimates beyond fiscal 2025.One of the reasons I'm suspicious that the estimates above could be conservative is that investors are now just learning about some intriguing new catalysts. For starters, news broke a couple of weeks ago that Nvidia is an investor in voice-recognition software company SoundHound AI.The terms of the partnership are not entirely known. However, Nvidia is just the latest big tech company to explore AI-powered voice assistants. Cohorts including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all invested significantly in similar technology -- thereby signaling that voice recognition could be a lucrative pocket of the overall AI landscape.In addition, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia also has a budding enterprise software business. While it's still early innings for Nvidia on the software front, I see many reasons to be optimistic about this endeavor. Namely, it shows that the company is already expanding beyond semiconductor chips.Moreover, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware development. Given that competition in semiconductor manufacturing will likely rise over the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin deterioration, as Nvidia will likely lose some of its pricing power.Nevertheless, it appears the company is already looking to outmaneuver such a dynamic by complementing its core data center operation with a software component.During fourth-quarter earnings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement when he declared that ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" On the surface, you might think this means Nvidia's rocket ship may be returning from orbit. But that's not the case.Rather, Huang went on to explain his philosophy in further detail. He believes that the installed base for data center infrastructure could double within the next five years. Given Nvidia's commanding position in this market, combined with the catalysts outlined above, investors have several reasons to believe that there could be substantial upside in Nvidia stock.Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently slapped a $1,400 price target on Nvidia stock -- implying roughly 60% upside from current trading levels. Whether or not Nvidia reaches this price, the bigger picture remains.All things considered, secular trends fueling spend in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to not only stay but actually rise significantly over the next several years. Given Nvidia's unique position across both hardware and software, coupled with an increasing number of use cases and applications, I see Nvidia's growth journey as just beginning.Now could be an interesting time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to build a position or add to an existing holding in Nvidia stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09 13:03:38+00:00,12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024. In 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an ""AI cold shower,"" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.A Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.On February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.Some of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.Why is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.  Suggested articles:10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 202412 Best American Stocks To Buy In 202411 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024 Disclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/12-best-ai-etfs-invest-130338071.html

For those investors considering getting in on either of these two stocks going forward, the question naturally arises as to which of these two FAANG stocks is the better investment right now. Let's evaluate them based on three important factors and see what conclusions can be reached. An economic moat is a term that represents a trait (or traits) that help a company outperform its competitors in a particular industry. The presence of a moat raises the chances that a business will still be around and thriving well into the future. The bigger the moat, the more successful a company is likely to be long-term.Without a doubt, Apple's main moat stems from its incredible brand strength. Consumers all across the world have no problem spending premium prices to attain the company's various hardware products. This has resulted in one of the most financially successful enterprises on Earth. Its moat helped Apple produce $233 billion in operating cash flow in the last two years (combined).Amazon's key moat source has to be its network effect. As a massive online marketplace that brings together merchants and consumers, the platform improves as it gets bigger. Add on a sprawling logistics network that allows for fast and free shipping on millions of products, and it's hard to see anyone competing effectively with Amazon.Owning businesses that have an economic moat is a good strategy to create a winning portfolio. Both Apple and Amazon have powerful competitive advantages, placing them in a league of their own in this regard.When it comes to future growth potential, Apple gives investors reasons to be cautious. The business reported a 2.8% revenue decline in fiscal 2023, with sales rising by just 2.1% year over year in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). Macroeconomic headwinds might be limiting the propensity of consumers to spend on new hardware devices.Because the iPhone still accounts for more than half of the company's sales, and it is in a very mature stage of its product lifecycle, Apple might not have many growth levers to pull with its current product lineup.As for Amazon, its growth opportunities abound. As the leading platform for online shopping in the U.S., it stands to capture a significant portion of consumer spending that transitions from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce. Related to that online shopping is Amazon's growth potential in digital advertising. It's a relatively new segment for Amazon, but it's generating some of the most significant growth in the company at the moment and has plenty of runway for additional expansion. There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing service provider that controls nearly one-third of the global industry's revenue. AWS' growth has slowed down somewhat in the past several quarters, but management is optimistic about the long-term opportunity. It makes sense why. According to Grand View Research, cloud computing is estimated to be a $1.6 trillion worldwide market by the end of this decade. Amazon is in the best position to benefit.Both Apple and Amazon have wide moats, but the latter clearly has better growth potential in the years ahead. This means Amazon has the lead in this competition thus far.The final factor to consider is the valuation. Here again, the nod goes to the e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut.Amazon trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 today. That's less than half of Apple's P/S multiple of 6.9. The iPhone maker sells at a valuation that far exceeds its trailing-10-year average, while Amazon is roughly in line with its past 10-year P/S ratio. Apple stock is trading at a premium given the market's expectations for future growth.Taking all the information together, Amazon looks like the best stock to buy of these two tech titans.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09 11:09:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"By selling some of the most in-demand hardware devices on the face of the planet, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most dominant enterprises out there. Its current market cap of $2.8 trillion attests to this.Unsurprisingly, this FAANG stock has been a massive winner for shareholders. It has skyrocketed 856% in the last decade, crushing the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500.Is it too late to buy Apple?According to Wall Street analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 4.2% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This would represent a huge slowdown from the 8.4% yearly top-line growth of the past decade. This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, though.Apple is a gargantuan enterprise today. Management says there are 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, demonstrating the company's ubiquity. It's extremely difficult to continue posting rapid growth on top of a fiscal 2023 sales base of $383 billion.Making matters more challenging is the maturity of the iPhone, Apple's flagship product line, which generated 58% of total company revenue in the last fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). But with newer upgrades having less game-changing innovations, consumers won't have a problem delaying buying the latest iPhones.Investors will point to the budding services division, which reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. But because this segment relies on more product sales in the first place, its potential is restricted by hardware demand trends.I believe it's totally reasonable to assume that Apple's expansion will be much more muted in the years ahead.Just because growth won't be spectacular doesn't mean this isn't a great business.For starters, Apple possesses one of the most powerful brands in the world. This not only leads to tremendous pricing power and customer loyalty, but it also protects the company from the constant threat of competition. Apple's various offerings are truly differentiated in the industry.Even more impressive is the company's incredible profitability. In the last five years, Apple's operating margin has averaged 27.8%.And generating cash isn't a problem. Apple produced positive free cash flow of $304 billion combined in the last three fiscal years. Management does a great job returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.The balance sheet is in pristine condition. As of Dec. 30, Apple carried $108 billion of debt on the books. That's not a concern at all, given that the business currently has $173 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the asset side.Investors don't need to worry about a potential recession. Apple always seems to operate from a position of strength.It looks like the market is fully aware of just how great this business is. This is indicated by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.8. That's much more expensive than the stock's trailing-10-year average of 21. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.It's best to view things with a fresh perspective. Investors are being asked to pay a premium valuation multiple for a company that is likely to register muted growth going forward. Even if you consider Apple's other favorable qualities, namely the brand and financial picture, I just don't view this as a smart bet to take. This isn't to say that it's too late to buy the stock. My perspective is that Apple would still make for a wonderful investment, just if the P/E ratio came down considerably.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09 10:50:00+00:00,"Billionaire Ken Griffin Owns Every Single One of the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks. Should You?","Follow the leader. It's a game most of us played as kids and many still play as adults. In some cases, following the leader might even be a smart investing strategy.Ken Griffin certainly ranks as one of the top leaders in the investing world. His Citadel hedge fund has achieved a level of success that few can match. Griffin's net worth stands at $35.4 billion, a reflection of his company's impressive track record.His Citadel portfolio includes a large number of stocks. Notably, Griffin owns every single one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Should you own them, too?We don't know for sure exactly how much Griffin has invested in the Magnificent Seven right now. However, Citadel's 13F regulatory filing last month revealed how much money the hedge fund had in each of the stocks as of the end of 2023:StockPercentage of PortfolioShares OwnedValue OwnedNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)1.81%3.63 million$1.8 billionMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)1.61%4.24 million$1.59 billionAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)0.95%6.23 million$945.9 millionMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)0.87%2.46 million$869 millionApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)0.4%2.08 million$401 millionAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)0.25%1.79 million$250.9 millionTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)0.09%350.4 thousand$87.1 millionData sources: 13F filings, HedgeFollow.com. All data as of 12/31/23.Griffin's bets on these seven stocks extend beyond direct ownership of shares. Citadel also owned call and put options on Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla at the end of last year.The hedge fund upped its stake in Nvidia by nearly 77% in the fourth quarter of 2023. That bet has paid off nicely, with Nvida's share price skyrocketing in 2024.Griffin also significantly increased Citadel's positions in Amazon, Meta, and Tesla in Q4. Two of those moves have made money, with Amazon and Meta shares jumping close to 15% and 40%, respectively, year to date. However, buying additional shares of Tesla has been a losing proposition for Griffin so far this year.Citadel reduced its stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in Q4. Two of those three decisions have proven to be good ones in 2024, with Apple and Alphabet shares falling. Griffin would have been better off holding onto his Microsoft shares, though, as the tech stock tacked on additional gains since the end of 2023.Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks comes with pros and cons -- like any other stock. The tremendous potential for artificial intelligence (AI) especially stands out as a major plus for all seven of them.The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to power AI apps continues to soar and likely will for the foreseeable future. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet should enjoy strong tailwinds as organizations shift IT spending to the cloud to harness the power of AI.Meta's open-source AI approach could reap huge benefits. And Apple CEO Tim Cook recently confirmed that his company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI with a major announcement likely coming later in 2024.Several of these Magnificent Seven stocks also share a common denominator that's on the negative side: valuation. NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, known by the nickname ""the Dean of Valuation,"" thinks that Nvidia and Microsoft are trading the most above their fair valuations. However, the share prices of Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla are currently below the fair values determined by Damodaran.The relative cheapness of Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla isn't accidental, though. Alphabet had an embarrassing public relations incident with its Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures. Apple's growth has slowed considerably, and Tesla faces intense price competition in China.Following the leader is only smart when the leader is going in the same direction you want to go. For income investors, that isn't the case with Griffin and his Citadel hedge fund -- at least not with the Magnificent Seven stocks. Sure, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia pay dividends. However, their dividend yields are low.Griffin doesn't focus on valuation. While value investors might find some stocks in Citadel's portfolio that are attractive, the group won't include even the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks.Growth investors, on the other hand, should love several of the Magnificent Seven. Keep in mind, though, that exceptionally high valuations could still dampen some of these stocks' growth prospects.The truth is that there's no single right answer to the question of whether or not you should own all of the Magnificent Seven stocks as Griffin does. However, if you're looking for long-term growth, several of these stocks should provide plenty of it.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09 10:22:00+00:00,"Beyond Nvidia, these companies are making money from AI","Nvidia Corp.’s growth over the past year has been breathtaking, because the company still has no real competition for graphics processing units that support the data centers that are building capability to support corporate clients’ development of artificial-intelligence technology.Nvidia’s stock completes dramatic reversal lower not seen in almost seven yearsA Palm Springs house sold for $1.3 million in 2023 after zero days on the market — up 113% on its 2021 sale price. It’s now in a $625,000 short sale. How is this possible?‘I’m very sad’: My brother refinanced our mother’s house and sold the contents. Can we claim a share of the proceeds?This isn’t a bull market — it’s a ‘duck’ market. Here’s why.AMD’s AI story is ‘unfolding fast.’ This bull sees a 25%-plus stock gain ahead.But the hardware build-out by Nvidia NVDA and other companies is only one part of the story. What about actual use of the new technology? Jon Swartz talked with industry experts and looked at the companies already making money from generative AI.Nvidia’s stock has soared over the past year, but its rolling 12-month consensus earnings-per-share estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet, has increased much more quickly. This means Nvidia’s forward price-to-earnings ratio has declined dramatically, even as weighted P/E valuations for the S&P 500 SPX and most of its sectors have increased.Here’s a breakdown of that P/E action, including 25 of the best-performing stocks in the benchmark index whose valuations to expected earnings have declined, with Nvidia leading the list.On the other hand: Nvidia’s stock continues to hit new highs. Why that may be ‘a bit unhealthy.’Another Nvidia warning: Cathie Wood sounds warning about Nvidia, whose rally she missedAn associated AI hardware play: Micron’s stock gets new buy call as it is deemed another chip-sector play on AIShares of New York Community Bancorp NYCB closed at $2.73 Monday. The stock was down 73% for 2024, with the slide starting after the bank surprised investors on Jan. 31 with a dividend cut while reporting a net loss springing from higher-than-expected provisions for loan-loss reserves. The bank said it was taking several actions to build capital, in part because it had crossed the asset-size threshold requiring it to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve beginning in April.New York Community Bancorp named Alessandro DiNello as its new chief executive on Feb. 29 and on the same day announced it had discovered ”material weaknesses” in its loan-review processes.On Tuesday, the stock rose 18% to close at $3.22. Then on Wednesday, a deal was announced through which several investment groups, led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s Liberty Strategic Capital investment firm, would invest $1 billion in the bank. The investment included the purchase of newly issued shares at a price of $2, convertible preferred shares with a strike price of $2 and warrants giving the group the option to buy more shares at a price of $2.50.DiNello’s tenure as CEO ended after less than a week, and Joseph Otting was named as the new CEO.Ciara Linnane and Steve Gelsi explained the terms of the deal and the backgrounds of the investors, along with the immediate reaction to the announcement.The Ratings Game: NYCB’s stock stabilizes after turmoil as it aims to build ‘fortress’ balance sheet and calm investorsAfter NYCB provided more details about the transaction during a call with analysts on Thursday, Gelsi provided a further breakdown of deal terms, including a fat 13% coupon on the new investors’ preferred shares.Through Thursday, NYCB’s share price had risen to $3.66, making for a paper gain of 83% for the investor group. And the bank estimated that the deal (excluding the potential exercise of the warrants) would translate to a tangible book value of $6.65 per share. Considering that over the past five years NYCB’s shares have traded for an average of 1.25 times tangible book value, there may be high profit potential for the new investors if they can restore the bank to steady performance.Joy Wiltermuth outlined NYCB’s lingering difficulties with commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans following the deal.As of Thursday’s close, the S&P 500 traded for 20.6 times its weighted aggregate consensus earnings estimate for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That P/E ratio was up from 17.8 a year ago, compared with a five-year average P/E of 19.4, a 10-year average of 18 and a 15-year average of 16.3.There has been a continual flow of warnings about the U.S. stock market being overvalued. Then again, since the S&P 500 is weighted by market capitalization, its high P/E and near-record level can mask greater volatility for many of its component stocks, as Joseph Adinolfi explained.If you believe it is best to move some of your portfolio away from U.S. stocks, it might be time to consider a different market that is cheaply valued. When negative sentiment peaks, the stage can be set for long-term investors to take advantage of low prices.Michael Brush outlined several potential catalysts for China’s stock market, interviewing money managers and suggesting individual stocks and an exchange-traded fund to consider there.More stock-market observations from Joseph Adinolfi:Quentin Fottrell — the Moneyist — visited Palm Springs, Calif., and looked at a house that sold for $611,000 in 2021, then sold for $1.3 million in February 2023 is now listed for $625,000. There are lessons to be learned from this story, along with Fottrell’s usual sound advice.Tough love from the Moneyist:Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL were down 12.1% for 2024 through Thursday, while the S&P 500 was up 8.4% and the U.S. benchmark index’s information-technology sector was up 13.4%, all with dividends reinvested.A sampling of MarketWatch’s coverage can help explain this dichotomy:Related: Rivian looks like it is trying to get Apple’s attentionSigns that a bull market for stocks is heading into a late stage can include a spike in initial public offerings or a perceived decline in quality for newly listed companies.Reddit filed for an initial public offering last month. This week, New Constructs CEO David Trainer warned that Reddit was shooting for an overly high valuation and that its business model didn’t make sense for a publicly traded company.James Rogers explained how the Reddit IPO could associate the company directly with the meme-stock phenomenon that came to the fore in 2021.

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.16%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 10.26% over the past month.

2024-03-08 22:27:34+00:00,Apple's new M3 MacBook Air: Top takeaways,"Apple (AAPL) recently released its latest MacBook Air model. The new laptop has an improved battery life, the company's M3 chip, and is geared towards AI applications. It comes at a time when Apple has seen a slowdown in Mac sales.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show for an in-depth review of the new computer, which he says is probably ""the best laptop you can buy.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- Well, Apple's latest MacBook is available today. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley got his hands on it. So what do you think, Dan?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, that's right, Julie. This is the MacBook Air 15-inch. It is running Apple's new M3 chip. That's the big update here. I also have a cat to my left if you can't see him. He's not as interested in this. He's looking for some food.This basically gets an update as far as the processor goes. The particular one that I have here has an M3 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte storage. That's basically what I think most people are going to end up when it comes to buying something like this. It's going to be a little bit more expensive than the base model. But, you know, the higher you go as far as specs, the longer it's going to last. It's just generally the idea when it comes to computers.So what's difference between this and last year's model? My wife and I actually bought the prior model, the same color and everything. The main difference is it has that M3 chip, which has slightly better performance in the M2 chip found in last year's model.It also has an anodized sealing around the color. This is the midnight color. And you can see some smudging on here. Better than last year's model, though, because whenever we pick it up or my wife picks it up after I use it, it looks like someone rubbed Crisco all over the outside of it.So thankfully, they've tamped down a little bit on the fingerprints. But overall, you know, look, the MacBook Air is one of the best laptops that you can get. It's light, relatively low priced as far as premium laptops go. And the battery just does not stop.I mean, it doesn't matter whether it's the Air or the Pro. I have a Pro from a few years ago that I use for work that I'm connected to right now. Haven't turned it on in two days. Just have-- let it sit. It wasn't turned off, but I just let it sit there. And the battery is still going, enough for me to run everything I need right now to broadcast.So I mean, if you can put that into perspective, the new MacBook Airs are going to last no problem. Apple rates for 18 hours, that's playing back video on iTunes. So don't expect 18 hours. But you'll be able to get through your day and then some. I managed to play a little bit of games on here.The performance is great. The price, again, it's Apple. So it's going to be a little higher, well above the thousand-dollar mark. But as far as overall, this is the best laptop you can buy probably.- Yeah, I mean, I guess the coating is also helpful when the cat walks across that as well.DAN HOWLEY: You need to walk over it.- Yeah. What are we-- do we know anything about what the demand is expected to be like for this?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, well, so the problem that Apple's had with the Macs recently is that they just hadn't updated them, I guess, enough. And so people weren't purchasing them. There was also, don't forget, the whole issue with COVID. As that came in, people started buying products.But Apple, in particular, was hit by a slowdown in sales. Factories have shut down. So then we saw, you know, rather than what we saw with PCs where everything shut up and then went down, Apple was kind of low then shot up later in the pandemic and then started to fall off. So they're on a different cycle than some of the other PC makers out there.But as far as demand goes, anytime there's a new product that comes out, Apple does see a little jump. So for them, the hope is that this will start to send sales of Macs higher for a little bit. The MacBook is really the seller for the Mac line. It's about the laptops. The desktops sell, you know, on their own, sure. But when it comes to the volume, it's really the MacBook. So getting this right, which they did, is incredibly important for that business.- And also there were some news today, some developments with Apple and Epic Games, Dan. Tell us about that.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So the day after-- a few days after we had seen that Apple had pulled Epic's license to develop for Apple's iOS system and put their own App Store into place in the EU and in the EU only-- this is part of that Digital Markets Act-- Apple released a statement saying that they had been working with Epic. And now they're going to allow Epic back in to the developer process.So that means that Epic will be able to put together its own App Store that people will be able to purchase ""Fortnite"" from as well as other Epic Games apps and services. So that's a big move. And it seems to be-- you know, Apple says that it's because they had conversations with Epic.The underlying thinking, though, is that there was some sniffing around by the European Commission, the antitrust arm of the EU. And they're already hitting Apple with a $2 billion fine, which Apple is going to appeal. But less trouble is better.So why not just let in Epic if it's only in the EU? It's not going to be in the UK or the US or anywhere else. So, you know, the Asian countries. It's not going to be the same. So it's probably just the easier path of least resistance for them to just let ""Fortnite"" and Epic back in.- All right. We'll see if that develops differently in other places. Dan, appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apples-m3-macbook-air-top-222734882.html
2024-03-08 21:39:09+00:00,Broadcom Suffers Worst Stock Drop Since 2020 on Slow Chip Sales,"(Bloomberg) — Broadcom Inc., a chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, suffered its worst stock decline in four years after reporting disappointing revenue from its semiconductor business, even as AI demand grew faster than expected.Most Read from BloombergHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear SuppliersChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilStocks Suffer ‘Heat Check’ as Rally Hits a Wall: Markets WrapTSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip PlantChina Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US CurbsThe company’s semiconductor division posted revenue of $7.39 billion in the fiscal first quarter, Broadcom said Thursday, missing the $7.7 billion projected by analysts. Still, the chipmaker remains on track for $50 billion in sales during fiscal 2024, which ends in October. That’s in line with its previous forecast.Though an artificial intelligence boom is fueling demand for Broadcom equipment, the company is contending with slower sales in some segments, such as telecommunications. That’s hurting its chip business. Broadcom’s infrastructure software sales, meanwhile, beat analysts’ estimates.The company’s stock, which had been up 26% this year through Thursday, fell 7% on Friday in New York. That was its biggest single-day drop since March 2020, the early days of the pandemic. Shares of fellow chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. also slid, hurt by a weak forecast. It too has been seen as a beneficiary of AI spending.Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said AI spending would strengthen this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company now expects the demand to account for 35% of its semiconductor revenue in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of 25%.Nvidia Corp.’s stratospheric rise in the past year has sent investors looking for other companies poised to get an AI windfall. Broadcom doesn’t make Nvidia-style chips — ones used to train the large language models that power AI tools — but it does supply vital networking components and handles custom chip design work. That makes it integral to the giant data centers that are processing AI workloads.Despite missing estimates for chip revenue, Tan said demand was strong for its networking products from AI data centers and that large cloud computing providers are clamoring for its custom artificial intelligence chips. They are “driving growth in our semiconductor segment,” he said in a statement.Broadcom’s profit was $10.99 a share in the first quarter, excluding some items. Analysts had predicted $10.42 a share for the period, which ended Feb. 4. Total revenue rose 34% to $11.96 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $11.8 billion.Software demand helped make up for semiconductor sales that were more sluggish than predicted. The infrastructure software division posted revenue of $4.57 billion, beating the $4.33 billion projection. Broadcom has suspended quarterly projections while it integrates and restructures its acquisition of software maker VMware.Broadcom’s Tan has built one of the largest companies in the chip industry through a string of acquisitions. He’s also diversified the business with a push into software — an effort bolstered by the recent purchase of VMware. The integration of that deal will take a year and cost about a billion dollars, including the expense of laying off workers, Tan has said.Broadcom provides key components for Apple’s iPhone, designs custom chips for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and is the biggest supplier of networking components that direct traffic between computers in data centers. During earnings calls, Tan typically gives updates on Broadcom’s at-times contentious relationship with Apple, though he refers to it obliquely as his “North American customer” or another vague moniker.On Thursday, Tan said Broadcom has a “very deep strategic and multiyear relationship” with the customer.—With assistance from Mark Gurman.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/broadcom-expects-ai-demand-help-232417739.html

He notes that Apple's share price has declined from its highs, stating ""it's getting no love from Wall Street,"" creating ""an opportunity"" for investors. He also highlights Apple's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for its iPhones, which he believes is a strategic ""refocus"" will drive future stock appreciation.On the other hand, Demmert advises investors to avoid Boeing stock. He cites the company's persistent production issues, safety incidents, and manufacturing setbacks, saying Boeing has severely undermined the ""decades [it takes] to build a good reputation."" He also mentions that the valuation has declined significantly, and the company continues to ""lose money.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.Though the broader market has hit record highs in the past few months, not all individual stocks are in positive territory. Some provide great opportunities to buy solid companies at a lower cost. Others are best left alone.I'm here with James Demmert, Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer. Thanks for being here.JAMES DEMMERT: Good to see you, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: So we're talking about two stocks today that are down year-to-date. And let's talk about your buy stock, first of all. And this is one that we have talked about a lot on the program.It's Apple. The shares are down about 10% or so year-to-date. So let's talk about why you still like it. And part of it is because it is down from the highs. So good value right now?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, Julie, it's down from the high. It's getting no love, whatsoever from Wall Street. And, in fact, the short interest, the amount of people shorting the stock has increased quite a bit.And we think that's an opportunity mainly for the underlying things. I think that investors are misunderstanding about Apple. Where are they going really in this what we call the new tech led AI bull market? It looks like they're left behind. But I think investors are mistaking that no, that's coming in the next quarter or two.JULIE HYMAN: OK, so let's dig into that a little bit here because Apple has teased what might be coming here. There's been a lot of focus on some negatives and some perceived negatives like slowing sales in China. But you think that the AI tech is coming. What gives you that confidence?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I think the China sales is moderating, first of all. I think investors should get used to that. And I think that's in the stock price at this point.What we think is exciting-- and if someone missed NVIDIA or any of the semiconductors that have been the really hot stocks that led AI in the first phase. This is where you want to go now because the next phase is where it is AI make a difference. And we think the iPhone is what's going to be carrying AI over the next quarter or 2 and 3.First, it starts with AI subscriptions probably in Q2. I don't think the street is putting that in the price of the stock here. And we think those subscriptions on a $200 million-- or 200 million users can be very significant to earn.JULIE HYMAN: Let me just stop you right there. Because what does that mean? Like meaning there would be something ChatGPT like that Apple is offering as a subscription service on devices?JAMES DEMMERT: Think like a Siri that's really incredible, right? Siri right now is really not incredible. We think that the AI subscription to Apple is going to be that on steroids.So you're really going to be able to talk to your phone. It's going to be telling you what to do in that first phase subscription, of course. Service is good for them. Recurring revenue for a long time. So that'll be the first phase we think that rolls out in Q2.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.JAMES DEMMERT: Q3 is really exciting because that's going to be iPhone 16. We think it's going to be a phone that people are going to need to buy because it's new hardware that can run this AI. So that's another very exciting product cycle.JULIE HYMAN: Well, James, I don't want to hear that because I just bought the 15. But let's get to your last point here, which is sort of the investment strategy and the redeployment of capital. You think that's going to AI just after they, for example, stopped their whole car endeavor.So why was that a good decision? And why is it good what they're doing with that money?JAMES DEMMERT: If you think about Meta, the era of efficiency, reducing costs, I think that's what Apple's doing here. They're saying let's give up on the driverless car in the $10 billion that we threw at that. Let's refocus. Where are they refocusing it? AI.So we think that's a very smart thought process they're going through of, hey, let's think about dollar in dollar out where is going to be most profitable. Really love that they're doing that. Stocks 25 times earnings, right?I think that's wrong. I mean, the PE, right? The E is estimated to be a certain number by the street. We think that E is too low. So the PE today actually may be lower in hindsight as we go forward over the next few quarters.JULIE HYMAN: We always like to put out a potential risk to this upside case. And in the case of Apple, it's that they don't bring this stuff to fruition soon enough.JAMES DEMMERT: That's exactly what the risk is. I mean, I think that if they don't make magic happen in the next few quarters, and I think it's the AI play.The stock definitely will be at risk because then you're going to have the China moderated sales on top of no real reason to get the 16. I think the stock would be in trouble.JULIE HYMAN: OK, gotcha. All right, let's get to your stock that you do not like. It's another one that's down year-to-date. And it's down quite a bit more than Apple. I'm talking about Boeing.Those shares are down more than 20% year-to-date. But you say, no, you don't want to get in here. Let's talk about why.First of all, there's sort of the obvious here. What's been going on production wise at the company?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I mean, it takes decades to build a great reputation, Julie. You know that. It takes moments to ruin it. And I think this is what's going on.This is the story with Boeing. And it's really a management problem. They've had mistake after mistake.Some of them the same mistakes over the last two years. And that is really making the institutional investors sort of walk away. And that's why the stock is down.Now, a lot of people think it's cheap because it's down a lot. And we think that is a value trap. And we can talk about valuation in just a moment.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, let's do that then. Let's talk about the valuation.JAMES DEMMERT: You know, here's a company in the last 12 months. That's lost money. I mean, this is an AI-tech led new bull market. That is not really where you want to be.AI can't save their valuation, right? But going forward, the street suggests that you're looking at the price relative to the earnings. You look at that.The streets are estimating the earnings to be at a PE to about 60 times earnings. The S&P 500 is trading at about 21 times earnings. Here's a stock.Three times as expensive as the average company, it's losing money. It's got a real reputation problem. I would stay away from a valuation.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and let's get to the last one here, which is competition. Airbus, of course, its big competitor not suffering from these same issues.JAMES DEMMERT: You know, Airbus has got that reputation down. They've really been able to be very consistent. Now, one problem with Airbus is they're pretty booked for a long period of time.But I think investors should recognize when companies have one of their biggest competitors have a problem like Boeing does, Airbus very well may come out with a new way to produce more planes sooner. So I think that competitive advantage that Airbus has could be a threat to Boeing another reason I don't want to own the stock.JULIE HYMAN: OK, one thing that maybe would draw you in, if the stock kept going down, would it get more attractive?JAMES DEMMERT: I don't want to use the pun-- the plane crashes here. But if the stock crashes, I mean, if the stock literally went down by 50%. I think investors then say, hey, maybe there's value now relative to book value, the amount of the number of the planes, and the future potentially getting brighter. But the stock would really have to come way down and be less than a market multiple.JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. All right, and just to be clear here, you own Apple shares, if I'm not mistaken.JAMES DEMMERT: We own Apple shares as a firm and as my family. Yes.JULIE HYMAN: OK, but you don't own Boeing?JAMES DEMMERT: No.JULIE HYMAN: No? All right, let's summarize what you're telling investors here today, James. By Apple based on its current price, I'd likely blockbuster announcement at some point and solid investment strategy avoid Boeing for its poor management current valuation and potential loss of market share.James, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it.JAMES DEMMERT: Thanks, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: And thank you for watching Good Buy or Goodbye.

2024-03-08 20:56:27+00:00,Apple reverses course and clears way for Epic Games to set up rival iPhone app store in Europe,"Apple has reversed course under regulatory pressure and cleared the way for a nettlesome adversary, video game maker Epic Games, to set up an alternative store for iPhone apps in Europe.The about-face disclosed Friday is the latest twist in a bitter fight between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, over the way iPhone apps are distributed and the fees for digital transactions that occur within them.Apple attributed the change of heart to reassurances from Epic that it won't violate its requirements for getting access to iPhone owners. Epic had brazenly broke the rules in the U.S. in 2020 to trigger an antitrust lawsuit alleging Apple's App Store is a monopoly.After a month-long trial, a federal judge in 2021 rejected most of Epic's claims in a ruling that withstood appeals, but the bickering with Apple has continued.Apple had rejected Epic's attempt to set up an account that would have allowed it to set up an alternative store for downloading iPhone apps — something that Apple has held exclusive control over for more than 15 years.But a new set of regulations called the Digital Marketing Act, or DMA, that took effect in European Union's 27-nation bloc earlier this week cleared the way for other companies to compete against Apple's App Store — an opportunity that Epic was eager to seize upon.Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had alleged Apple’s actions to stymie its efforts to open an app store in Europe were part of its efforts to retaliate against the video game maker for challenging a system that has been a huge money maker for the iPhone maker. Apple collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% for digital transactions completed within iPhone apps, an arrangement that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company while spurring complaints from Epic and other companies who rail against the fees as monopolistic price gouging.European regulators signaled Apple's rejection of Epic's effort to set up an iPhones app developer account in Europe, based in Sweden, might run afoul of the DMA, raising the specter of potentially a substantial fine.Apple didn't mention the regulatory approval in a brief statement saying it is now satisfied Epic will follow all its rules.Sweeney applauded regulators for taking swift action to rein in Apple in a social media post that hailed the outcome as “a big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.”The bad blood between Apple and Epic is far from over. Apple is demanding more than $73 million from Epic to cover its fees in the U.S. antitrust case over the App Store. A hearing on that demand, which Epic has described as outlandish in court papers, is scheduled later this month.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reverses-course-clears-way-205627288.html
2024-03-08 20:03:09+00:00,Fortune 500 list: The top 10 companies dominating business,"This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Fortune 500, a list of the largest U.S companies ranked by revenue. The first edition was published in 1955, with companies like General Motors, Jersey Standard, U.S. Steel, and Chrysler topping the list.Today, a new cast of characters are dominating. In 2023, Chevron secured the 10th spot on the list, bumping off drugmaker Cencora, after the oil company recorded $36.5 billion in profits last year.Here are the top 10 companies from the Fortune 500 list in 2023. Our 2024 list will launch in June.WalmartWalmart raked in over $611 billion in revenue last year to secure the first spot for 11 straight years. The company recently completed a $2.3 billion acquisition of TV maker Vizio, a move that experts say will help the company advertise to customers.The company, headquartered in Arkansas, is run by CEO Doug McMillon and employs over 1.6 million people.The company also bought entrepreneur Marc Lore’s startup, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion in 2016 and is running a pilot of Lore’s latest company, a restaurant concept called Wonder, in one of their supercenters. Walmart plans to open two to three more of Lore’s restaurants in their retail chains this year.As one of several retailers, like Target and Home Depot, to report sales losses due to “shrink,” or inventory loss that includes theft, Walmart has recently posted limitations on self-checkout lines to alleviate shoplifting, which accounted for over $112 billion in industry losses in 2022, according to the National Retail Federation.AmazonAmazon, with a yearly revenue of nearly $514 billion, holds the number two spot on the list for the fourth year.Run by CEO Andy Jassy, the ecommerce giant also offers cloud services and digital advertising along with streaming platforms like Fire TV and Amazon Prime Video. It employs about 1.5 million people. The company has two headquarters in Seattle and Arlington.Amazon has recently announced an investment of more than $10 billion to build data centers in Saudi Arabia to help the country diversify its oil-dependent economy. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp have also invested. Amazon plans to spend $5.3 billion to create new infrastructure in the region to train local developers in 2026.Exxon MobilExxon Mobil brought in a revenue of over $413 billion to take the third spot on the list away from Apple this year. The company moved through the rankings from it’s sixth place spot last year, and could owe its success to a year of record-breaking profits for oil and gas companies in 2022. With CEO Darren Woods at the helm, the company made $55 billion in profits last year and employs over 62,000 people globally. Headquarters are in Houston, Texas.This year, it's been involved in a whirlwind of acquisitions from fracking giants to lithium drilling operations, which the company is investing in to remain an industry leader as consumers shift to electric cars. At the end of last year, Exxon Mobil announced plans to drill for lithium in southern Arkansas and expects to produce the material, which is critical for electric vehicles, by 2027.AppleIn 2023, Apple dropped to fourth place on this list, but it still holds the title for most profitable company on the Fortune 500—a title it’s held for eight years.The company, with Apple Park as its headquarters in Cupertino, California, is run by CEO Tim Cook and employs about 161,000 people and generates revenue from key products like the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and software platforms like iOS.Apple recorded more than $394 billion in revenues in 2023. It’s had a rocky year with regulators–it was fined $2 billion by the European Union’s antitrust commission over a complaint brought by Spotify stating that the company refuses to let streaming services inform iOS users of cheaper off-platform subscriptions, which in turn creates a barrier to competition in the digital music market.In a statement, Apple has said the Commission failed “to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm,” and accused Spotify of “coordination with the European Commission.”UnitedHealth Group With a revenue of over $324 billion, UnitedHealth Group is the highest-ranking healthcare company on the Fortune 500 list. It maintained the fifth spot on the ranking for a third straight year.The company, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is run by CEO Andrew Witty and employs about 400,000 people to develop health technology, financial services and pharmacy services.In February, the U.S Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the company as part of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts against some of the biggest American companies, including Apple, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.CVS HealthCVS has brought in over $322 billion in revenue this year and fell from number four to number six on the list last year. The group’s CEO Karen Lynch tops Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in Business list for the third year in a row. Her aspirations for the company, she told Fortune, are expansive.With a headquarters in Rhode Island, the company employs about 300,000 people and generates most of its revenue from healthcare benefits and pharmacy services.In the next few years, she said, there will be “unprecedented change, more change than probably the last 50 years.” Some of those changes include the company’s overhaul of its prescription drug pricing model, which it announced  in December, and could help customers save money on drugs. The company announced it will roll out a new reimbursement model that aims to make drug costs more predictable and offer cash discount cards in the coming years.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet’s multinational holding company holds spot number seven on the list for the second year in a row with a reported revenue of over $302 billion dollars.Berkshire Hathaway, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, employs about 396,000 people and owns businesses in insurance, rail transportation, energy generation and distribution, and manufacturing and retail sectors. It’s also a large stakeholder in American companies like American Express and Coca-Cola.In February, the company’s stock hit a brief record high with a valuation of $1 trillion.Alphabet Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Microsoft Corp, generated over $282 billion in revenue last year to secure its number eight ranking on the list. The two companies have been on the forefront of AI development, and lately, have been cracking down to moderate the software, too.Headquartered in Mountain View, California and run by CEO Sundar Pichai, the company employs about 182,500 people and leverages its search, web browsing, advertising and cloud computing to generate money. Its revenues from Google Cloud have also been growing rapidly.In March, Google announced in a blog post that it plans to reduce spam, low-quality and unoriginal content in search results by 40%, after complaints surfaced that Google’s search engine results are filled with spam.McKessonThis medical supplies company earned nearly $264 billion in revenue last year to secure spot number nine on the list, the same spot it held last year. It’s one of the lesser known companies on the top 10 of the Fortune 500 list, but its CEO Brian Tyler spoke to Fortune on some of the hallmarks of his four-year tenure.Headquartered in Irving, Texas, employs over 80,000 people and generates revenue through pharmaceutical distribution, wholesale medical supplies, and pharmacy technology services.ChevronWith about $246 billion in revenue, Chevron closes out the list at spot number 10. The company’s revenue climbed about 52% last year due to rising oil prices, and has been investing in a number of initiatives this year, from green hydrogen plants to buying South American acreages for petroleum.With a headquarters in San Ramos, California, and CEO Mike Wirth leading the company, it employs about 45,600 people and sells crude oil and natural gas.In March, Chevron bought a stake in acreage offshore Uruguay and joined several other industry companies with interest in South America’s potential for oil discoveries. This month the group also shuttered its operations in biodiesel plants in Iowa and Wisconsin.The group recently announced ambitious plans to construct a green hydrogen facility in southern California, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2026, and will harness energy from an existing 29-megawatt solar energy array to generate hydrogen. Chevron intends to use ""non-potable"" water, a non-drinkable by-product of its oilfield operations, for its green hydrogen facility.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/fortune-500-list-top-10-200309643.html

2024-03-08 19:18:57+00:00,Apple backs down on EU ban for ‘Fortnite’-maker Epic Games,"Apple has abruptly reversed a decision to ban Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” from launching its own app store on iOS in Europe — just a day after European Union officials said they were investigating the matter.It’s the first major test of Europe’s new digital competition rules that went into force on Thursday, and it highlights how the Digital Markets Act may already be having an impact on consumers just a day after going into effect.Apple relenting means Epic will be able to bring “Fortnite” back to iPhones in Europe, Epic said in a blog post. “Fortnite” has been unavailable on iOS since 2020, when the two companies went to war over Apple’s developer terms.“Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,” Epic wrote.Apple said it reached the decision “following conversations with Epic” in which Epic committed to following Apple’s new EU-focused policies.“Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program,” Apple said in a statement.The move comes after the European Commission said it had requested information from Apple about the latest allegations — and after a top EU commissioner, Thierry Breton, warned on X “there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers” and identified Epic’s complaint as an issue of “priority.”The new EU DMA requires app stores to allow app downloads from third-party sources. Apple’s solution to the rule is a system allowing developers to create all-new iOS apps that act as self-contained app marketplaces.In its complaint to the European Commission, Epic accused Apple of yanking its approval of a developer account because of Epic’s past history of criticizing the iPhone maker. Another alleged reason for revoking the account was Epic’s deliberate, previous violation of Apple’s terms — in order to call out what Epic said was anticompetitive behavior by Apple.Emails that Epic published on Wednesday appeared to bolster those claims, showing Apple leaders telling Epic they expected the company to intentionally breach Apple’s store terms again. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote back to Apple promising to abide by its terms, but Apple rescinded the developer account anyway.In a statement after the emails were published, Apple publicly justified the move by referencing US court rulings that affirmed Apple’s right to terminate Epic’s accounts for any reason.Now, however, Apple appears to have relented in the face of pushback by EU officials — paving the way for Epic, and “Fortnite,” to again become available to players on iOS in Europe.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-backs-down-eu-ban-191857390.html

Sweeney had taken issue with how Apple was complying with the new DMA law, calling it “hot garbage” and a “horror show.”Epic needs the developer account to launch apps in the region and go ahead with its app marketplace, which will serve as as a substitute for Apple’s App Store. Until now, the iPhone maker hasn’t permitted the downloading of apps outside its marketplace — a process known as side loading. Apple typically charges a commission of 15% to 30% on purchases within its App Store.“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies,” Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement Friday. “As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”EU official Thierry Breton “noted with satisfaction” on the social media site X that Apple had backtracked on the decision.Epic’s developer account had already been banned by Apple in the US and elsewhere since 2020, when Epic bypassed Apple’s payment system to sell in-app upgrades to users. That set off a long conflict between the two companies, ultimately resulting in Apple and Epic going to court. Apple mostly prevailed, but was forced by a judge to make it easier for developers to point customers to outside payment methods for in-app purchases.After detailing its plans to comply with new EU regulations earlier this year, Apple moved to mend fences by granting Epic’s Sweden division a developer account in the EU.But tension flared again. Sweeney complained about new fees that Apple was imposing as part of its DMA compliance, suggesting that it wasn’t following the spirit of the new law. Late last month, Apple App Store chief Phil Schiller complained to Epic about Sweeney’s remarks.“Your colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan, coupled with Epic’s past practice of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules,” Schiller said in an email to Sweeney that was later disclosed by Epic. “In plain, unqualified terms, please tell us why we should trust Epic this time,” Schiller wrote.Then, on March 2, Epic’s developer account was banned. Apple defended the move on Wednesday, saying it had the right to terminate Epic entities from its platform. It cited court determinations that the game maker had committed an “egregious breach of its contractual obligations” and Apple had the right to ban the new account “in light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior.”But after EU regulators and iPhone app developers pushed back against what appeared to be a retaliatory move, Apple reversed course. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion for allegedly harming Spotify Technology SA and other music services in the EU — and the company likely didn’t want to incur more penalties.It’s unclear what this means for Epic and Fortnite potentially being restored to Apple’s iOS platform outside of the EU.(Updates with Thierry Breton post in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reverses-move-ban-fortnite-190644428.html

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst Jason Moser. Jason, how's your Monday going so far?Jason Moser: So far, so good, Deidre. Beautiful weather here in Northern Virginia and just another good reminder that spring is right around the corner.Deidre Woollard: It is indeed. If it's not maybe the best Monday in the world for Apple, one of the most interesting stories out today is about this $1.8 billion euro fine from the European Commission leveled at Apple. What's happening here is the European Commission says Apple really kept users from learning about other music apps, which led to consumers paying higher prices. Not the first time we've heard this about the App Store, is it?Jason Moser: No, it's not. We'll get to the gate-kept part of the story here momentarily, I'm sure. But you're right and this is something that as Apple gets bigger, the drumbeat for this only grows louder. I think many will call this the fight for more open internet for consumers. think most of us are on board with that. I think the big picture that's probably the right side on which to be and Apple seems to be pushing against that narrative a little bit, so it doesn't really look good. The optics don't really look that great for them in that regard. One of the things that really stood out to me, the response to the fine Apple said Spotify stands to gain the most from this E.U. pronouncement. I don't know, to me, I feel like the longer-term implications of something like this, consumers by far and away have more to potentially gain from something like this. I understand Apple needs to defend itself and they will at virtually any cost that we've seen, but this is clearly something that's not going to go away. My guess is they're seeing the writing on the wall, where the trend, where the puck is headed here. It's not necessarily in favor of Apple at this point.Deidre Woollard: No, and it's interesting because Apple will tend, usually to take a very neutral response to these things. I felt like their reply was not very neutral. They took aim at Spotify. They said, Spotify has benefited from Apple's reach. Then they paid nothing. It's going to appeal. This isn't over by a long shot, but basically, it sounds like they feel Spotify was not going behind their back, but certainly very [laughs] deeply involved with the European Commission in everything that led to this outcome.Jason Moser: Spotify definitely, they didn't just let things play out. They were very much on top of this one. They never really let it go. They absolutely really paid attention to this ruling and fought for this outcome and it makes sense. There's no question Spotify has benefited from being on Apple's platform. That's not really the point, though. I think ultimately the point, when you look at it from the bigger picture is, getting back to that gatekeeper mentality. There was a point where you see a company like Apple wielding so much control over everything that's going through that walled garden, so to speak. Weird point. I trust regulatory concerns are out there abound. It's very hard to imagine that this is not something that will continue to gain steam here. Spotify right now, they have a greater-than-50% share of Europe's music streaming market. That's more than double their closest competitors. When you look at Spotify, compare it to Apple, Spotify is clearly winning on the streaming-music front, but it's important to note to Apple as a competitor in this space, that Apple competes with their own music-streaming service I think makes this hurdle a little bit more difficult for them to clear.Deidre Woollard: It's interesting to see the way that the App Store has evolved because when you think about it in the beginning when we first had the iPhone, it made sense to have this central location for security's sake, as Apple has said to make sure that everything met certain expectations and of course, if you had a physical store and you had people selling goods in it, you would charge rent, you would want to be compensated. All of that made sense in the beginning, but now we've got all of these larger movements that are happening. Rules are changing country-by-country. I do believe it's better for the consumer in the long run, but it also seems this is becoming a really chaotic and confusing experience.Jason Moser: Well, it is. Actually, ironically enough, that could work out in Apple's favor over the longer haul. I absolutely understand Apple's perspective that hey, we can run this App Store. We can make it the most efficient. We can give people the best experience, we can make it the most secure. I think where a lot of people would push back on I think this is where this is going is ultimately that there aren't any other choices. Just Spotify, for example, in order to subscribe to Spotify, fairly certain you have to do that through the web operating system. You can't do that through mobile. Then Apple going back to that, Spotify had to pay anything for benefiting from being a part of our ecosystem. That is true to the degree if you want to subscribe to Spotify, I believe the only way to do that is through the web interface. Listen to me, that is something I think that as time goes on, we're only going to see consumers more and more choice. That seems to be the trend in however this stuff plays out. Ultimately, consumers want more choice and that's what this all boils down to. I think that's why this put Spotify and any other company that's going to join in on this in a little bit of a better spot here because again, Apple has gotten so big. It's not saying we don't want to have that Apple option out there. We just want more choice. Now a lot of consumers will look at that and say, you know what, that's fine. I'm glad I have that choice, but the Apple experience is just far better and I'm happy to deal with that Apple experience. A lot of people love that Apple ecosystem and want to stick with it. But I think ultimately at the end of the day, it really just boils down to choice. Typically, I think having more choice tends to win out.Deidre Woollard: Well, speaking of more choice, I want to pivot to another story which is essentially about choice in a way which is that JetBlue and Spirit are calling off their merger. This is not a big surprise because there's a choice that you hear, too. A federal judge had blocked the deal after the Justice Department said it would be anti-competitive. Spirit really, they needed this deal. They had to deal with Frontier before JetBlue got involved and obviously, that fell apart. You've got this company, they've got a large amount of debt. Travel is still good. People joke about Spirit, but they still fly in it. It's cheap. It's an adventure, but it can be worth it. But I'm worried about this company. If part of the idea here was to keep choice open and to keep our options open for consumers, if this company falls apart, that doesn't seem like it's good for consumers.Jason Moser: Well, this is a bit of a conundrum and I'm glad you brought up the Frontier thing. I wonder if we won't see the idea of some partnership or merging with Frontier. I've wondered if we won't see that come back into play here. Obviously, not surprising, the writing was on the wall here. But when you look at JetBlue and Spirit, I agree with you. Spirit much more needed this. JetBlue didn't need this, Spirit really needs this. But when you have to discount airlines, I absolutely understand the concern of combining them ultimately making a little bit more difficult for the price-sensitive consumer. I think that probably makes sense in that regard. I think this speaks to the difficulties in running a business like this. Airlines as we know, very difficult line of work. We've talked about this before. You go back to that 2007 Warren Buffett wrote in one of his letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The quote, ""If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done a successors a huge favor by shooting Orvell down."" He just wasn't really isn't the biggest fan of airlines. That still doesn't even keep him away. He still goes back to the well every once in a while. But this just really puts Spirit in a difficult spot, speaking of choices, they don't have a ton of choices right now. When you look at the capital position they are in, they have a ton of debt on the balance sheet. They've 8% secured notes that are due in September 2025 to the tune of $1.1 billion and this company's financials are just hemorrhaging cash. This really puts them on the clock. They're going to have to figure out a way to shore up their balance sheet. They get I think $69 billion from the termination of this deal, but that really is just a drop in the bucket compared to their bigger-picture problems. I'd have to imagine the executive team at Spirit right now is working around the clock trying to figure out how to deal with this.Deidre Woollard: Well, on the other side of this, I want to look at JetBlue, too, because their stock went up after this was announced. They're not in danger there, back to business. But I was thinking about this and then about their partnership with American Airlines that was deemed anti-competitive. Are there some strictures on how big JetBlue can be? It's always been smaller compared to the big airlines. It was going to try to use either the collaboration with American or the acquisition of Spirit to grow. Now it's struck out twice. What does that mean for the company in terms of how it thinks about growth?Jason Moser: Well, I think that given the market on which they focus, very value-oriented offering, that is just going to limit the market opportunity in general. They are a portion of that overall airline market. It's not to say they can't do a great job in that space. It may limit exactly how much they can grow, but they could still go in there and really own that space. I think that for JetBlue at least they can get back, focus on what they do well. This isn't something that ultimately puts them behind the ball in any fashion. They can get back to really focusing on serving the customers that they know how to serve. If they come up with some ideas of perhaps expanding beyond that value offering then that potential will certainly exist. But again, like you said before, this is something where Spirit is absolutely feeling this one more so than JetBlue ever will.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to go to one more story that you and I have talked about before. This is the ongoing saga of, is Macy's going to go private? [laughs] It's an interesting one because Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital, they upped their offer from $21 to $24 a share, values the company around $6.6 billion. Current market cap is just under five. It is an interesting time for them to up the offer because last week, Macy's announced they're closing around 150 stores in the next couple of years. They're restructuring, it's obvious that things quite aren't working. Both Arkhouse and Brigade noted the plan failed to inspire investors. A little bit of an understatement there. If I'm a shareholder, I'm probably asking myself, is there any way the company can do better than this offer via performance? I'm not sure I see the path. What do you think?Jason Moser: I think that's the right question to be asking yourself and I think the answer is very clearly, no, this is as good as it's going to get. If I'm a shareholder of Macy's, which I'm not and I never have been, but if I were a shareholder, I would be absolutely voting in favor of this and I probably wouldn't even be wasting time worrying about the vote. I would probably go ahead and just be selling my shares, taking advantage of this bump on the raise of this offer because like you said, we talked about Macy's before, the challenges that they've they've had. There are plenty of concerns with a business like this. Obviously, this is a business playing defense. They are absolutely not playing offense. They're not looking for ways to grow. They're really looking for ways to whittle down the cost structure and find a way to be more efficient. Operating margins have been cut by more than half over the last 10 years. Talk about financials hemorrhaging. This is another company, financially speaking, it's just not in a very good position. Again, back to playing defense and there are clues out there that tell us there may not necessarily be a need for Macy's in this world. I'm not calling Macy's JCPenney, but I am saying that we watched this happen in real time at JCPenney.We watched investors get in there and try to take advantage of the opportunity to see if they couldn't turn things around, fix things. Ultimately, you have to ask yourself the question, in this day and age, is Macy's something necessarily that the world needs? I would argue, need, no, maybe there's a want there, but it feels to me like the want is going to ultimately manifest itself in a smaller footprint. That's OK. Macy's can exist, albeit a little bit smaller than it does today, but if that's the case, then clearly shareholders today don't want to be on that ride. We invest for growth, we invest for reliability, dividends, things like that, and Macy's right now, not in a position really to offer investors that case. To me, this is one of those things we take advantage of the opportunity you have in front of you here. Honestly, like we see all the time. When private equity gets involved with things like this, ultimately, a lot of cases, they end up spnding these companies back out to the public markets anyway. There are a bunch of Macy's loyalists out there. Hey, listen, maybe you don't have to wait long. It'll come back around as perhaps a little more of a realistic opportunity.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what it becomes on that side. But you just mentioned selling because this has -- this had me thinking a little bit about any time I see news about a company I'm invested in, if there's a potential merger or a takeover or anything like that, I always wonder, when do you know when the moment is to say, OK, this is going to be great, I should stay here, or no, this is going to look weird? What kind of questions do you ask yourself?Jason Moser: That's a really valid concern. It really is just it's looking at that company, looking at the thesis that your investment was based on from the very beginning. You could invest it in something like Macy's with a value thesis, not necessarily a growth thesis. You go into something like a Macy's and say, well, I feel like it's undervalued, I'm going to buy shares today, and when it reaches this intrinsic valuation that I've determined then I'm going to sell shares versus something where you feel like you're investing in a business that you want to own for the next 10, 15, 20 years because you feel like there's a growth opportunity there. I think ultimately, it's understanding that perspective of why did you invest in the business in the first place? What is the ultimate end game there? Then figuring, well, what's the upside from where we are today? I think you look at Macy's, for example, and you think, well, there's probably not a ton of upside at this point. But you look at other companies out there that may still have years upon years of growth in front of them. Even if they're suffering from some unforced errors, you can still overcome that, things can change. Macy's, I think, is a good example of a business where maybe we've seen they've tried to change, they've tried to improve the situation, but the market dynamics, just the nature of the market that they serve just makes it very difficult to do so.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, it seems like we've seen what we're going to see with that one.Jason Moser: Yeah. Very well said.Deidre Woollard: Thanks for talking with me today, Jason.Jason Moser: Thank you.Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on this show, but it's just a peek at The Motley Fool's investing universe.

Motley Fool contributor Lou Whiteman joined my colleague Ricky Mulvey to talk about the state of air travel and some literal radar stocks.Ricky Mulvey: We were going to check in on some airlines, but before that, I often hear that this is an industry that retail investors should just stay away from. They've got uncontrollable oil prices driving business cycles. They're very mature, they're hard to scale. There's fairly low switching costs for customers. Got a lot of pensions you gotta pay for. Why are these companies worth investors' attention? We're going to do some bull cases. Why are we focusing here?Lou Whiteman: Yeah, I'll put it into words of Warren Buffett. He once said that if there had been a capitalist back at Kitty Hawk, that person would have done the world a favor if they just shot they experiment down. That's what Warren Buffett feels about the airlines and historically going all the way back to the late 1970s deregulation, this has been a tough industry to invest in. Every time we had a down cycle, we know the names: Braniff, TWA, Eastern, airlines just went out of business. I will say at the risk of saying it's different this time. We've had a lot of consolidation starting in say, 2007-2008. We've built up a big four of United, Delta, American, and Southwest. They are better able to control costs now because they have some pricing power. I think the days where companies go out of business when times get bad are over. It still is a cyclical business that even in the best of times has low margins, so investors have to be careful here. But for maybe the first time since the late '70s, there is a case for buying airlines because they're just better-run companies than they used to be.Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, instead of the Fed backstop, what we saw in the pandemic is a congressional backstop for a lot of these companies. There seems to be too big macro forces hitting these airlines at the same time. One is that a lot of the margin that airlines made was on business travel and that doesn't appear to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels. There's some of it returning, but Zoom has been adopted and it's, it's hard to convince companies to open up their budgets for a lot of those sales meetings. There's also a greater interest in traveling abroad. More flights to Central America from North America, for example. There's the well-wrought story of revenge travel. How are airlines responding to these trends? Are there any that are performing a little bit better than others?Lou Whiteman: Definitely, historically, the big three now, Delta, United, and American, who are left, they made their money off business travel. That has changed, and you're right, business travel has lagged as in terms of recovery. It's less of a big deal than it would have been because of a lot of the changes in the way airlines price. They're a lot smarter about pricing, there's a lot more technology in pricing. But yes, this industry is at its best when business travel is flourishing. I do think it's coming back. Zoom has taken over some meetings, but in a work-from-home world, you do come check-in sometimes and it creates new opportunities. The way the industry has thrived the last few years, though, is this pent-up demand for tourism travel and for vacation travel. If you've traveled last few years, you know, airports are full, planes are full, they have great pricing power. They're using their technology to price each seat and maximize revenue. A lot of us, myself included, have been surprised at how well that trend has continued even as things have gotten a little shakier in other areas to the extent that it continues. These companies are looking at a strong 2024. However, we don't know how long it holds out this time and it would be nice to have that business cushion, that higher-margin, less price-sensitive fare to fall back on. The companies do hope we do see at least a return to trends, if not growth in that area.Ricky Mulvey: I think you're also going to see while business travel may return, it may not necessarily mean that businesses are going to pay for business class, especially as there's wide company meetings where everybody's getting together once a quarter, that kind of thing where there's, let's say, a high-level salespeople are jet-setting and in traveling business whenever they like.Lou Whiteman: Just real quick on that. Look at how smart they've been in recent years. If you've flown, you know there's economy plus, there's economy of leg room, you pay extra for a window seat. So yeah, we don't have that delineated first-class, business class, and coach but they are finding more ways to extract additional revenue out of each seat on the plane with some of these economy-plus features so that has helped the offset at least.Ricky Mulvey: The big story of this year for the airlines has been the attempted mergers and in most cases, them getting blocked. You had a JetBlue and Spirit which we've covered a bit on this show. Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines, which were two smaller regional players and I think that surprised some market observers. There's also this story that we haven't talked about with Delta and Aeromexico. We were chatting in Slack about this. You said this was fascinating and I didn't ask you why because I wanted to save it for this. Basically, the airlines had a joint partnership, which the Department of Transportation is unwinding. Let's first get into the argument to break these companies up. This is not something that I heard a lot of people calling for.Lou Whiteman: Let's step back here because I think it is interesting. It talks about how these airlines are trying to position themselves. In most countries, the United States included, there's a cap on foreign ownerships. You can't do cross-border mergers and acquisition in this industry. Contrast that with the need by airlines to get their customers, especially business customers, access to the globe. You can't buy foreign competitors. You don't want to fly a plane to every airport on the face of the Earth. That's why we have these huge alliances. You've seen them on the side of planes: SkyTeam, Oneworld, Star Lines. This is a way to connect your customer to wherever they have to go around the globe. Problem with alliances, though, is it's pretty easy to break one alliance and go into another. Delta was on the forefront here of trying to make equity ties by minority stakes in key partners. They did it with Virgin Atlantic, they did with Aeromexico, they did it with LATAM, where they're trying to forge permanent ties short of a merger. The downside of that is that it opens yourself up to more regulation on these alliances because there's money involved, there's equity involved. Delta and Aeromexico, two strong partners. This is an area where Delta desperately needed a partner. American Airlines with its hubs in Phoenix and hubs in Dallas, they have Mexico covered. United which has always had a strong presence there. Delta needed a partner. They have an arrangement with Aeromexico and yeah, now suddenly a couple of years in, after it was approved, regulators are having second thoughts.The backstory here is, is a lot of this is a dispute between the United States officials and Mexican officials over a new airport in Mexico City. The president of Mexico opened up a second airport. Mexico City International is one of the biggest in the world, but a new, smaller Felipe Angeles International Airport. He put a lot of money into it. Not a lot of people are flying there. Mexican government has decided that a lot of U.S. airlines, especially cargo airlines, will be required to use that new airport. United States isn't happy with this, Department of Transportation. In part, they are targeting this Delta-Aeromexico to try to get leverage to reopen negotiations on this. It could still happen. It could happen that Delta and Aeromexico have to unwind. They have until October. If I was to be a cynic and Ricky, I'd never be a cynic with you, but I can't help but wonder if closer to that date if we'll see some movement on the airport issue, and then maybe that will be movement on this Delta-Aeromexico partnership. But if it does happen and it is scheduled to happen now by the end of the year, that would be a blow to Delta. Not a fatal blow, but that would be bad news for Delta.Ricky Mulvey: Is that why you don't think Delta shareholders seem to mind as right now, it's maybe some political puffery, if you will?Lou Whiteman: I think there's a lot of that. Mexico is a very important destination. Delta will still fly to major cities. They are going to lose by their estimate, it would cancel nearly two dozen routes. They would lose access to some second-tier Mexican markets. It's not the end of the world, even an important market, if you lose access to second-tier cities in a foreign market. How material would it be? I don't think it would be significantly material. It would be a blow to their business and their aspirations to grow in the region. But I don't think it's a thing that investors need to lose sleep over.Ricky Mulvey: Well, I'm not losing any sleep. Let's wrap up. I hope Dylan forgives me for stealing this from the Friday show. But let's do some literal radar stocks. I know you've got three. What are some airline stocks that investors should put on their radar?Lou Whiteman: I'm breaking this down into three categories here. If you want, slow and steady and as we said at the top, I do think it's a safer environment to be a long-term investor in airlines, Delta leads this revolution. They are well managed. They are the ones that came up with this new pricing scheme they've tried, with some success but sometimes not success to spread themselves internationally with these investments. Delta is just a forward-thinking, well-run company with good hubs. They have a better labor situation than most of their rivals. Delta is a reliable company to buy and I think my favorite of the big four. If you want a little more risk but with some growth upside, there's a company out of Denver called Frontier. ULCC is the ticker there. They are the best potential growth story in this industry. It's a model not everyone likes. It's the pay-for-everything model but it is popular in Europe. It's growing popular in the U.S. They have a huge order book of planes. If it goes to script and if management is ever able to do what they want and there is more risk here that is an if, but they are the best potential for five to 10 years out significant growth to the company and hopefully that would mean significant growth to the stock there.That's your better, more risk, more reward candidate. Then the other option is, and this is the one personally Ricky, I've taken, I believe in the long-term growth of global air travel. You have a rising global middle class, you have people, hopefully, I think permanently prioritizing experience over maybe material goods. There is a lot of demand out there around the globe for air travel. It's hard to buy into that by buying just one airline stock. But there's a company called AerCap that I know is a Fool favorite. What they do is they finance planes. They buy planes directly from Boeing and Airbus and they lease them to the airlines. AerCap right now is my favorite way to get exposure to this -- what I think is a sustained multidecade trend toward more travel without taking all of the single-company risk and single-geography risk that comes with buying an airline.Kind of a wild card, kind of cheating because it's not an airline but that's one to look at if you are a believer in these trends and maybe don't want to settle up with just one carrier.Ricky Mulvey: If you have an issue with Lou Whiteman cheating on his three airline radar stocks, our email is podcasts@fool.com, podcasts with an s @fool.com.

2024-03-08 16:29:13+00:00,Nvidia on cusp of overtaking Apple as second-most-valuable company,"By Medha Singh(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.An AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.Nvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.The relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.Nvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.""Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,"" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.""It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.""Meanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.In recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.The stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.By comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.""Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the ""AI narrative"" stocks out there,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.""We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.""However, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.Over the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.""Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,"" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/nvidia-cusp-overtaking-apple-second-160413392.html
2024-03-08 14:45:23+00:00,12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024. Stocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a ""Goldilocks"" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.The 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February ""60 Minutes"" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts. The stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an ""overbought"" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains ""overbought"" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of ""overbought"" for three consecutive months or more.BofA analysts commented: ""A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.""Some of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our Methodology We scanned The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's holdings that seeks to track the investment results of S&P Total Market Index, which is composed of U.S. equities.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

2024-03-08 13:50:20+00:00,Jim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s 5 Latest Stock Picks This Week.Jim Cramer in his latest program talked about the ever-growing appetite for semiconductor chips in the market, demonstrating the enormous gains of semiconductor ETFs, in addition to semiconductor stocks like Nvidia, which Cramer yet again called the “undisputed” leader of the industry.While Cramer said semiconductor chips have seen a huge improvement in their performance over the past few months, there’s another kind of chips that is the epitome of the inflation crisis. You guessed it right, Cramer is talking about potato chips. Cramer said a standard bag of potato chips has seen a 45% jump in price over the last few years, but the quality and quantity of these chips remained the same. Cramer said the rise in food prices after the pandemic has been disastrous for Americans. Cramer said not everybody could invest in stocks like Nvidia because of the burden of food prices and no extra income. But for those who can, which Cramer called the “haves”, the rise in food prices amounts to “nothing” because of the riches they are making in the stock market. Cramer said that’s the “beauty” of investing.Jim Cramer drew an interesting contrast between two factors to demonstrate the forces at work when it comes to the demand of semiconductor chips and potato chips. Cramer said the launch of ChatGPT infused a generative AI revolution which is behind the insatiable demand of semiconductor chips. Companies like Meta Platforms are gobbling up hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s expensive chips to power their generative AI systems. On the other hand, in the healthcare industry, top American companies are working on weight loss drugs which are also known as GLP-1. These drugs increase willpower and diminish cravings and temptation of tasty but unhealthy foods like potato chips.Cramer said the “paths” of people who invested in microchips and those who buy potato chips are very different and perhaps would never meet.In addition to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer loves, there are some new names he recommended this week. In this article we will talk about these new stock picks of Jim Cramer.For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC aired this week and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 19Jim Cramer was recently asked during his program about Powell Industries, Inc (NASDAQ:POWL). The questioner said the stock is already up about 100% year to date. Cramer said “it’s not done” as he thinks the stock has more room to run. Cramer said Powell Industries, Inc (NASDAQ:POWL) is a “just a really good company” and it reminds him of Eaton Corporation which Cramer’s charitable trust owns. Jim Cramer said he wish the stock would come down a bit so he could “put it in” his charitable trust’s portfolio.Liberty Park Capital Management made the following comment about Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) reported another quarter of better-than-expected earnings and bookings. The company is benefiting from record demand for large industrial projects. Investors are assigning a record multiple for POWL shares despite management communicating that orders have likely peaked.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24T-cell therapy company Cabaletta Bio Inc (NASDAQ:CABA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on. Recently, a questioner asked Jim Cramer about his investment in the biotech company and said he’s worried about the volatility in this stock. Cramer said he’s always felt that this is an “incredible, hopeful” product. Jim Cramer said he “typically” does not like a lot of biotech stocks but this is the kind of therapy he “believes in” and that’s why he’s “OK” with the stock.Cabaletta Bio Inc (NASDAQ:CABA) shares have gained about 154% over the past one year.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 24 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Cabaletta Bio Inc (NASDAQ:CABA).Alger Small Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cabaletta Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:CABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Cabaletta Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:CABA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of targeted cell therapies for autoimmune diseases. The company’s leading candidate, CABA-201, usd a cell therapy approach for the treatment of lupus and myositis, where the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted CABA-201 for New Drug Applications, setting the stage for initial phase 1/2 readouts in the first half of 2024. We believe CABA-201 represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance where biotechnology stocks rallied on lower interest rates and several acquisitions, Additionally, the company has reported positive clinical developments throughout the year which encouraged investors to anticipate an effective regulatory pathway to approval in our view.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Energy infrastructure company New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending these days. When asked about the stock in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said:“I want you to buy it.”Jim Cramer said some people are trying to “stifle” Wesley Robert Edens’ (New Fortress CEO) “brilliance.”  Cramer said “don’t count me in one of those people” since he’d want to buy the stock because of the leadership skills of Edens.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 24 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE). The most notable stake in New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) is owned by Michael Novogratz’s Fortress Investment Group which owns a $506 million stake in New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE).Like New Fortress, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 31Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC recommended a caller to “stay interested” in On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON). Cramer said he agrees with a latest note from UBS about On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) in which the investment firm said On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is doing really well. Cramer said he’s been saying On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is doing well for a “very long time” and said he is “sticking by” his bullish view on the stock.Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“In the third quarter, we purchased shares of On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON), a developer and distributor of athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories. On is one of the fastest-growing scaled athletic sports companies in the world. Management’s vision is to build a premium global sportswear brand based on innovation, design, and sustainability. Its products are sold through approximately 10,000 premium retail stores, which account for 65% of revenue. The balance of sales occur through its direct-to-consumer channel, encompassing its own branded and operated stores, as well as its website.On was founded in Switzerland, but it has expanded quickly across the globe. Its products have exhibited sales momentum in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The company is rapidly growing its base of roughly 10 flagship retail stores, and it plans to end this year with 47 stores across 18 cities in China. Roughly half of its revenue is generated in North America, 45% in Europe, and 5% in Asia Pacific. On is addressing a large market opportunity: the $355 billion global sportswear industry. This market has seen its growth driven by continued trends toward athleisure. Consumers continue to pivot their spending towards more comfortable and casual attire as they lead healthier, more active lifestyles.We believe On should be able to grow its revenues faster than 20% for many years, while also expanding its margins. We expect its growth to be driven by expanding brand awareness leading to market share gains in its core running shoe category, particularly as On expands its geographic footprint. We expect the company to continue to reinvest into its business at high rates of return. We believe On has a large opportunity to take market share in newer shoe categories, such as tennis (Roger Federer is an investor and advisor), training, and outdoor. The company also has a significant opportunity to grow its offerings in the apparel category.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 33Jim Cramer said in a latest program that Chewy Inc (NYSE:CHWY) is bottoming and that he is sticking to his bullish call made on the stock earlier. In January, while discussing Barclay’s bullish note on the pet retailer, Jim Cramer had said that he agrees with the notion that Chewy Inc (NYSE:CHWY) has gotten too cheap. Like Chewy, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chewy Inc (NYSE:CHWY).Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s 5 Latest Stock Picks This Week.Suggested Articles:Jim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock PicksJim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 StocksJim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 StocksDisclosure. None. Jim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week was initially published on Insider Monkey.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/jim-cramer-10-latest-stock-135020817.html

Without the inconvenience of fingersticks or scanning, Dexcom CGM Systems transmit your blood glucose readings in real time to a handheld receiver or smart device.Patients can control their glucose and accomplish outcomes like a lower A1C and more time in range by making better decisions about what to eat, how much to exercise, and how to take their medications when they have simpler access to real-time CGM data.The Dexcom G7 CGM sensor needs only 30 minutes to warm up, and there is a 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a seamless transition between sessions. The alert settings on the system have also been improved.The new direct-to-Apple-Watch feature for G7 will boost the sensor’s accessibility, driving better acceptance and reliability among its patient population. Moreover, it will allow to target a patient population using smartwatches, including Apple watches, for managing their health.Per a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital diabetes management market was estimated to be $18.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $35.8 billion by 2028 at a growth rate of 13.6%.The market is being driven by escalating diabetes care solutions and technological developments that have made it possible to introduce highly adaptable solutions. Other significant drivers include the increasing popularity of the use of connected devices and apps as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions.Given the market potential, the improvement and innovation of new features for its CGM system are likely to provide a significant boost to Dexcom’s business.Dexcom recently announced the FDA clearance of its Stelo glucose biosensor, which is available over-the-counter to consumers without a prescription. Stelo's approval for non-prescription use would further facilitate this population's access to cutting-edge CGM technology.In December 2023, Dexcom announced the Dexcom G7 CGM System connectivity with the t: slim X2 insulin pump by Tandem Diabetes Care in the United States, marking the first AID integration with the Dexcom G7 CGM.Dexcom also unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Athenry Co. Galway. With the ability to produce millions of Dexcom rtCGM sensors annually, the new plant is likely to contribute to the betterment of diabetes patients throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.DexCom, Inc. price | DexCom, Inc.

2024-03-08 12:19:07+00:00,Why another unexpectedly hot jobs report could derail markets,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Wall Street was taken aback by the US labor market’s resilience in January. Another unexpectedly hot report could shake things up again.The January jobs report showed that the US economy added a stunning 353,000 jobs that month and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%. That all but cemented investors’ belief that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates at its March policy meeting, and, coupled with hot inflation data, raised doubts about whether the Fed would cut rates at all this year.Those fears waned after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his congressional testimony this week that he’s not taking rate cuts off the table. Investors cheered Powell’s signal, helping push the S&P 500 index to close at a record high Thursday.“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle,” Powell said on Wednesday. “If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.”Still, the central bank hasn’t made it clear when it will begin paring back rates, keeping investors on edge ahead of key data releases. Economists expect that the US economy added 200,000 jobs last month, according to FactSet estimates. While far below January’s searing tally, that estimate would be a continuation of a historically strong labor market that’s stayed resilient against interest rates at a 23-year high.Traders largely expect the Fed will begin cutting rates in June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But those expectations could shift again depending on how the latest labor data looks, some investors say.“There’s no wiggle room for investors — even a slight upside surprise to job creation might rekindle fears about interest rates needing to be ‘higher for longer,’” wrote BeiChen Lin, investment strategist at Russell Investments, in a Monday note.It’s not just jobs data on Wall Street’s radar. The January Consumer Price Index is due next Tuesday, and investors will watch closely, especially after price hikes eased less than expected in January.“I would like to see inflation move down, a couple more data points, so we can be confident on that sustainable path to 2%,” Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Thursday on CNBC, adding that she believes more moderation in areas like employment growth could put the Fed in a position to cut rates later this year.Some economists are looking even further ahead to the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, slated for release at its March policy meeting. More specifically, investors are looking to the Fed’s dot plot, which charts the interest rate expectations over the next few years from each member of the Federal Open Market Committee.Central bank officials in December penciled in three quarter-point rate cuts for 2024 in their dot plot, which is released every other month.“Dots that point to one or two cuts rather than the three the market is anticipating may surprise folks, with incoming data likely to move the needle following hot January [labor] data,” wrote José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, in a note on Wednesday.Europeans using Apple, Google and other major tech platforms woke to a new reality Thursday as a landmark law imposed tough new competition rules on the companies — changing European Union citizens’ experience with phones, apps, browsers and more.The new EU regulations force sweeping changes on some of the world’s most widely used tech products, including Apple’s app store, Google search and messaging platforms, including Meta’s WhatsApp.And they mark a turning point in a global effort by regulators to bring tech giants to heel after years of allegations that the companies harmed competition and left consumers worse off, reports my colleague Brian Fung.The broad obligations apply only to the EU, which could leave tech users in the United States and other markets looking longingly at some of the features Big Tech is rolling out in response to the European directive.In one seismic shift to comply with the law, Apple said it plans to let EU users download iPhone apps via third-party app stores — easing its grip on iOS for the first time since the App Store’s debut 15 years ago.In another significant change, Google said it will alter search results to drive more traffic to independent comparison-shopping or travel-booking sites, instead of directing users toward Google Flights or other tools it owns.Google will also allow Android users to select a preferred browser and search engine from a menu of options when first setting up their devices, rather than defaulting users to Google’s Chrome browser and search engine. That could give a leg up to rival browsers such as Opera or Mozilla’s Firefox and competing search engines including DuckDuckGo or Microsoft’s Bing.Read more here.Customers of New York Community Bank (NYCB) pulled $6 billion worth of deposits between February 5 and March 5, leaving the bank’s deposit base 7% lower at $77 billion, according to my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald.However, the pattern is not indicative of a bank run, which these days can drain a lender of funds in mere hours. Shortly ahead of its demise, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank tried withdrawing $42 billion in one day over fears they wouldn’t be able to access their funds if the bank failed.NYCB provided the updated figures on an investor conference call Thursday morning after it announced it secured a $1 billion investment from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, among other private equity companies.Before the company disclosed in a filing last Thursday it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls, there weren’t significant changes in the bank’s level of deposits, said Alessandro DiNello, NYCB’s outgoing CEO, appointed just last week.“Friday was not a great day,” he said. “Over the weekend, Monday and Tuesday deposits were strong again.”Read more here.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/why-another-unexpectedly-hot-jobs-121907226.html

Broadcom’s market value has more than doubled over the past year, and its stock has been the third-biggest gainer on the PHLX Semiconductor Index in that time behind Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Surging demand for systems to power generative artificial intelligence services has driven sales for Broadcom’s networking chips, which are used for things like connecting Nvidia’s popular GPU chips together in data centers to form what are effectively AI supercomputers.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/m/8a042a29-087d-34ce-8eb0-1a7faa3f3471/unless-you%E2%80%99re-nvidia-the-ai.html
2024-03-08 11:00:00+00:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Adobe, Apple, Nvidia and Block","Chicago, IL – March 8, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Adobe ADBE, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Block Inc. SQ.Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.AdobeAdobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion.ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Adobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.AppleApple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.CEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.Block Inc.Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.Block remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average.The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

2024-03-08 10:21:00+00:00,Apple Has Spent $175 Billion on R&D Since the Start of 2013 -- but It's the $651 Billion Spent on Something Else That's the Real Jaw-Dropper,"Although it's been surpassed by Microsoft as the largest publicly traded company by market cap, few tech giants have delivered for investors quite like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).Despite its ebbs and flows, shares of Apple have scurried higher by 790% over the trailing-10-year period and have skyrocketed by almost 132,000% since its initial public offering in December 1980. Investors who simply purchased shares of Apple and did nothing else have historically done pretty well.While there's a laundry list of catalysts that have lifted Apple's valuation over time, the company's success ultimately boils down to two factors: innovation and a surprising ""investment"" that's been highly beneficial to its shareholders.To become one of the largest publicly traded companies, a business will generally have to grow at a sustained high rate and remain on the cutting edge of the innovation curve within its respective sector or industry. Peering back through more than 11 years of annual and quarterly filings, it's clear that Apple and its management team, led by CEO Tim Cook, aren't afraid to invest for the future.Research and development (R&D) expenses have grown every year since the start of 2013 and total just over $175 billion through the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (Dec. 30, 2023):2013: $4.475 billion in R&D expenses2014: $6.041 billion2015: $8.067 billion2016: $10.045 billion2017: $11.581 billion2018: $14.236 billion2019: $16.217 billion2020: $18.752 billion2021: $21.914 billion2022: $26.251 billion2023: $29.915 billionQ1 2024: $7.696 billionSome of these growing R&D expenses are undoubtedly directed at keeping the company in the lead in the smartphone arena. Since Apple integrated 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's seen its domestic market share in smartphones surge above 50%. Consumers tend to be exceptionally loyal to Apple's physical products, which include iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, among other accessories.However, Apple's R&D spending goes beyond the physical products that brought the company fame. For years, Tim Cook has been overseeing the evolution of Apple's operations. Although it's still producing and improving its popular physical products, Apple is aiming to be a platforms company that's ultimately driven by subscriptions.The advantage of the company's services focus is threefold:Subscriptions typically generate higher margins than physical products.It'll further enhance the loyalty of Apple's customer base by keeping consumers within its ecosystem of physical products and services.The steady revenue generated by Apple's Services segment will smooth out the sales fluctuations traditionally observed during iPhone upgrade cycles.What's even more eye-popping than the $175.19 billion Apple has spent on R&D since the beginning of 2013 is its ""investment"" that's nearly quadrupled R&D in size over the same period.With Apple generating boatloads of operating cash flow, it has the ability to take chances that most companies can't match. It can also reward shareholders in a way that no other business can.On a nominal-dollar basis, Apple's dividend is one of the largest in the world. Last year, the company doled out just a hair over $15 billion to its shareholders as a dividend. But its share repurchase program is many multiples larger.Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, Apple has overseen the repurchase of $650.88 billion worth of its common stock, which is tops among publicly traded companies:2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks2014: $45 billion2015: $35.253 billion2016: $29.722 billion2017: $32.9 billion2018: $72.738 billion2019: $66.897 billion2020: $72.358 billion2021: $85.971 billion2022: $89.402 billion2023: $77.55 billionQ1 2024: $20.139 billionThe beauty of share buybacks is twofold. To start with, a declining share count incrementally increases the ownership stakes of existing investors.But the second and arguably more important catalyst is that stock repurchases can increase a company's earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income will see their EPS grow over time as their outstanding share count declines. This can make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.As an example, Apple's net income declined from $99.8 billion in fiscal 2022 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September) to roughly $97 billion in fiscal 2023. But thanks to Apple spending $77.55 billion on buybacks last year, which retired more than 513 million shares, the company's adjusted EPS actually increased by $0.02 to $6.13 per share in 2023, despite the $2.8 billion drop in net income.Since the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased nearly 11 billion shares of common stock, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares.While buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's share price over the past 11 years and change, Wall Street and investors are likely eager to see one of the world's largest tech companies reignite its growth engine after it stalled out in 2023. But as long as Apple continues to aggressively put its money to work via buybacks, it's reasonable to expect modest EPS expansion.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-08 10:06:00+00:00,78% of Warren Buffett's $369 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 6 Stocks,"For nearly six decades, Warren Buffett has put on a master class in how to beat Wall Street. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a jaw-dropping aggregate return of 4,961,342%, as of the closing bell on March 1.Extensive books have been written discussing the investing philosophies that have allowed the Oracle of Omaha to trounce Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. These traits include buying stakes in brand-name businesses with strong management teams, as well as investing with a long-term mindset.But if there's one catalyst to Buffett's undeniable investing success that doesn't get nearly enough credit, it's his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both he and the recently departed Charlie Munger, who Buffett described as the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway"" in his annual letter to shareholders, have firmly believed that their top investment ideas deserve added weighting. If these top holdings perform well, it likely means Berkshire Hathaway stock can head even higher.Based on closing values from March 1, 78% -- $290 billion -- of the $369 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in only six stocks.Any question investors may have had about the Oracle of Omaha's desire to concentrate his company's portfolio is answered by looking at Berkshire's mammoth stake in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Even after Buffett and his team reduced their company's stake in Apple by roughly 1% during the December-ended quarter, it still accounts for 44% of invested assets.Apple's innovation has driven the outperformance of its stock for years. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's pretty consistently held a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.But this innovation extends well beyond its well-known physical products. For years, CEO Tim Cook has been overseeing a transformation that's emphasized subscription services. To be clear, Apple isn't forgetting about the physical products, like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, that brought it fame. Rather, it's evolving into a platforms company that'll further enhance customer loyalty and keep these customers within its ecosystem of products and services.The Oracle of Omaha is also, undeniably, a fan of Apple's world-leading capital-return program. Since introducing a share repurchase program in 2013, Apple has bought back more than $600 billion worth of its common stock.Another company that Warren Buffett and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, clearly love is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Berkshire owns more than 13% of the outstanding shares of BofA, which equates to almost $35.5 billion in market value.The lure of financial stocks for the Oracle of Omaha has always been the cyclical nature of the industry. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, economic downturns pass quickly. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, two periods of growth over the same span stuck around for at least a decade. Companies like Bank of America should be able to successfully grow their loan portfolios over time as the U.S. economy expands.Interestingly enough, Bank of America also holds an advantage in the current economic climate as the most interest-sensitive of all U.S. money-center banks. In other words, no bank will see its net-interest income shift more with changes to interest rates. The Fed's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to BofA's bottom line each quarter.To boot, BofA typically returns in excess of $20 billion to shareholders each year via dividends and buybacks when the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders.Even though a tech stock accounts for the leading stake in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, there's not a sector Buffett enjoys putting his company's cash to work in more than financials. It's why American Express (NYSE: AXP) is the second financial stock in Berkshire's top-three holdings.The not-so-subtle secret to AmEx's continued success is its willingness to play on both sides of the transaction aisle. In the U.S., which is the top market for consumption globally, it's the clear No. 3 in credit card network purchase volume.But in addition to facilitating transactions and collecting a fee from merchants, American Express is also acting as a lender to consumers and businesses in which it earns annual fees and interest income. During extended periods of economic growth, AmEx's ability to double-dip allows it to thrive.The other factor that makes American Express a top-notch investment is its success in luring well-to-do consumers. People with higher incomes are less likely than the average earner to alter their spending habits during minor periods of economic disruption. On paper, this should help AmEx navigate challenging economic climates better than most lending institutions.The fourth-largest holding is the longest-tenured stock in Buffett's portfolio, beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Shares of Coca-Cola have been held since 1988.What's more, Berkshire Hathaway is netting a roughly 60% annual yield on its Coke shares thanks to a minuscule cost basis of $3.2475 per share. Coca-Cola recently increased its base annual payout for a 62nd consecutive year.A big reason the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team view Coca-Cola as a core holding is its consistency. According to Kantar's annual Brand Footprint report, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand from retail shelves for 10 years running (as of 2022). Since it's selling consumer staples that'll be purchased in any economic climate, Coca-Cola's cash flow and profits tend to be highly predictable.Coca-Cola also enjoys virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has existing operations in every other country. This allows it to generate that aforementioned predictable cash flow in developed markets, while moving the organic growth needle via emerging markets.Throughout much of this century, energy stocks have played little or no role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Over the past two years and change, we've witnessed a sizable shift in sentiment from Berkshire's brightest minds. Integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) currently holds the No. 5 spot in the $369 billion portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees.Having more than $19 billion invested in a leading oil and gas stock is a pretty clear indication that Buffett and his team believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms. Supporting this thesis is multiple years of capital underinvestment by major energy companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This underinvestment has led to energy commodity supply constraints that should provide a healthy lift to the spot price of crude oil and push profits for drillers higher.The ""integrated"" aspect of Chevron's operating model is also important. Although drilling generates its juiciest margins, Chevron owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. If the spot price of crude oil declines, the company's midstream and downstream assets act as a hedge that stabilizes its cash flow.The icing on the cake here is that Chevron doles out a 4% yield and has raised its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.Warren Buffett's $369 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway only has two energy stocks, but they occupy the fifth and sixth spots in terms of portfolio concentration. The 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) held by Berkshire, worth $15.2 billion on March 1, have all been added since the start of 2022.While the macro catalysts described with Chevron align similarly with integrated oil and gas operator Occidental, there are some very defined differences between these two companies.For example, Occidental brings in the lion's share of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment. This means its operating cash flow is highly sensitive to shifts in the spot price of crude oil. While it'll benefit more than other integrated operators (including Chevron) if oil prices increase, the reciprocal is also true -- Occidental will struggle mightily if the spot price for crude oil significantly declines.The other big difference between Chevron and Occidental can be seen on their balance sheets. Whereas Chevron has what's arguably the best balance sheet among oil majors with a low debt-to-equity ratio, Occidental is still lugging around $18.5 billion in net debt. Unlike Chevron, Occidental needs the spot price of crude oil to remain high to continue reducing its outstanding debt.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-08 09:12:34+00:00,BofA Says Tech Stocks Post Largest Weekly Outflows on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The largest weekly outflow on record for technology stock funds hasn’t dimmed the broader euphoria that is driving US equities to “ferocious” gains, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.Most Read from BloombergHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear SuppliersChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilNasdaq 100 Falls 1.5% as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets WrapChina Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US CurbsTSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip PlantAbout $4.4 billion was pulled from tech funds in the week through March 6, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. The outflows come as Apple Inc. shares entered a technical correction this month, amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.Hartnett — who has taken a more neutral tone on stocks this year after remaining bearish in 2023 — said equity markets are showing “abnormal gains” in “abnormal times” after a 25% rally in the S&P 500 since end-October. That’s left positioning “stretched and extended” ahead of expectations for an eventual interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, he wrote in a note.US stocks have scaled record highs this year, driven by the frenzy around artificial intelligence and optimism about a pivot in the Fed’s monetary policy. A narrow group of tech behemoths — the so-called Magnificent Seven — have driven a majority of the gains, but there’s been a growing dispersion between the stocks in the past few weeks.While Nvidia Corp. has scaled record highs, Apple and Tesla Inc. have slumped 12% and 28%, respectively, this year.Still, Hartnett reiterated that technology stocks could have more room to rally, even though semiconductors are trading at their highest level on record relative to the S&P 500.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists also don’t see a concentration risk in US stocks, as they say the top stocks trade at much lower valuations than the largest stocks did at the peak of the tech bubble.“While investors usually think of elevated concentration as a sign of downside risk, the S&P 500 rallied more often than it declined” in the 12 months after past episodes of peak concentration, Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider wrote in a note.For BofA’s Hartnett, the only factor that could “melt this determination” in markets is a drop in US payrolls. Latest data, due Friday, are expected to show the US economy added 200,000 new jobs last month.Other highlights from the note, citing EPFR Global data:Global stock funds had inflows of $6.9 billion in the week through March 6, while $17.3 billion was added to bond fundsUS stock funds registered outflows of $100 millionEuropean funds suffered a tenth straight week of redemptions at $1.2 billion--With assistance from Michael Msika.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/bofa-says-tech-stocks-post-091234284.html

2024-03-08 01:00:31+00:00,TikTok Divestment Push Advances With House Committee Approval,"(Bloomberg) -- A top Republican lawmaker said he’d seek a House vote next week on a bill that would force TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell the app or face a ban in the US, injecting new momentum into a congressional push to curtail Beijing’s influence over the video-sharing service.Most Read from BloombergStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets WrapEx-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic PrimaryChina Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US WheatUnited Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10sTrump Wins Republican Nomination, Setting Up Rematch With BidenThe legislation, which was advanced by a key committee on Thursday, would block internet service providers and app stores such as those run by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google from offering the platform unless TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. sells it within six months.After the Energy and Commerce Committee voted to approve the bill by a vote of 50-0, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the number two Republican in the House said he would bring it up for a vote on the House floor. Scalise said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the measure would force TikTok to “sever their ties with the Chinese Communist Party.”Previous legislative attempts to restrict the app nationwide have failed, and this one would still have to clear legislative obstacles in the House and Senate, where it doesn’t have a sponsor. But lawmakers say this latest effort has been months in the making, fueled partly by renewed security concerns that China is surveilling Americans.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he was “talking with my chairs and caucus about the legislation. I will listen to their views on the bill and determine the best path.”TikTok mounted a last-minute effort to counter the bill, which was unveiled Tuesday, by urging its users to call congressional offices to protest the bill via a message that greeted them when they opened the app. Congressional offices were flooded with calls, drawing the ire of House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher.Lawmakers said “their phones were ringing off the hook last night,” Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican, told journalists outside the Capitol on Thursday. “The intimidation tactics, the disinformation has to stop,” he said later in a video message.In the end the campaign was unsuccessful, at least in preventing lawmakers from taking the first step toward enacting the legislation.Read More: TikTok Can Keep ‘Bad Lip-Sync,’ Lawmakers Seeking Sale SayBoth Democrats and Republicans have long expressed national security concerns over TikTok’s ties to ByteDance, citing risks of the Chinese government collecting personal data from Americans and spreading propaganda on the app. The platform has been under a national security review since the Trump administration. The Biden administration has signaled cautious support for the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying Wednesday that “we would want to see this bill get done.”TikTok has consistently denied that it has or will share any US user data with Beijing and has tried to assuage US concerns by spending more than $1.5 billion to isolate its US operations and agreeing to oversight from American partner Oracle Corp. TikTok said in a statement that the legislation would trample First Amendment free speech rights and deprive millions of small businesses of a platform on which they rely.The app is already emerging as an important place for conversations in a presidential election year. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has even created an account on the app ahead of November’s vote. More than 170 million Americans scroll the app every month, making its users an important asset.After the vote, TikTok said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the new bill “has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.”Divesting TikTok from its Chinese parent would be a complicated, though perhaps not impossible, maneuver. ByteDance developed the technology at the foundation of the viral video service and its engineers also support a twin service for the China market called Douyin.Earlier: TikTok Threat to Amazon Emerges With $20 Billion Shopping PilotIf forced to proceed by US lawmakers, ByteDance might try to separate the US business of TikTok while retaining the business in the rest of the world. TikTok’s US business could be valued at $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year.Any outright sale however faces strong opposition from Beijing, which could try and block such a deal. The Chinese government has been sensitive to leakages of data abroad, particularly when they involve giant internet firms such as ByteDance.In 2020, under pressure from the Trump administration, ByteDance went through extensive negotiations to separate the American operations and turn them over to either Oracle or Microsoft Corp. While the Chinese company picked Oracle, the deal was ultimately called off as the Biden administration took over and opted not to impose a ban.(Updates with Schumer statement, in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the PollsHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tiktok-divestment-push-advances-house-203742044.html

And-- in terms of moving as a block, right? And people keep trying to find new cute catchphrases for--ANN BERRY: Fab Four.JULIE HYMAN: --the new thing. Yeah, exactly, Fab Four, whatever have you. I mean, what do you think? What do you like in that group? Or do you think that investors are better served by looking outside of that entirely?ANN BERRY: Julie, here's what I find so interesting about what's happened with this Magnificent Seven group. I think we're now seeing outsized reward for good performance and good outlooks, and we're seeing outsized punishment relative to the rest of that set just for being more realistic. And I'll give you an example. Look what we've seen with Apple. And I think Apple has experienced two things that the rest of this group are at risk for. Number one, Apple had the courage to shut down its EV business after spending a billion a year for the last decade on trying to develop an electric vehicle.You compare Meta, which has wasted over $40 billion on the metaverse since the end of 2019. But just because Apple unveiled its bad news in this market, it's been punished very heavily. Whereas Meta has been able to regain ground by gaining in other places, such as AI. Similarly, if you look at what's happened to Apple in China, a real fall in iPhone sales in China.I think we're going to see some of that China weakness materialize when it comes to semiconductors. I think it's going to hit NVIDIA, it's going to hit some of the others. I think Apple's become a microcosm. And I think what we're going to see is the rest of this group at risk.JOSH LIPTON: And talk about some picks, Ann, that I know you like. One is CRM, Salesforce. Why do you see opportunity there, Ann?ANN BERRY: Well, I think with something like Salesforce, they've gone through this cycle, Josh, that Apple's going through at the moment, which is they're flushing their bad news. They've made some really difficult decisions around cost reduction. They've been making some very aggressive moves on pricing. They are doing short-term initiatives to try to gain market share down the line, that's going to hurt them in the near term but help them gain share in the long termAnd so I'm seeing Salesforce take bold moves, self-medicating, to try and get through this tough period of adjustment. But at least they're doing it. So I want to go into these names before we see all the results come full throttle.JOSH LIPTON: And I want to get you on here on this, Ann. Another interesting pick for you, you've got a cybersecurity pick. We were talking-- which is such an interesting space right now because we were talking to Rob Owens from Piper, and Rob's been covering the space for a few decades at this point. He said, listen, it's as healthy as he has ever seen it. But we were talking about how different names kind of reacting differently. You saw CrowdStrike, they reported, they're clearly capitalizing. Palo Alto Networks reported and very much disappointed, but that's a name you like, Ann. How come?ANN BERRY: Well, Palo Alto Networks is one when I invest on the private side, specifically, Josh. In the cybersecurity sector. I, for example, invested in a deepfake detection company. The name that keeps coming back to me over and over and over again by those who are innovating and operating in cyber is Palo Alto Networks, as best in class.And yes, they came out with a less than rosy outlook for the year. I would call it a realistic outlook for the year. One they can truly execute upon and deliver against expectations. And their share price got absolutely hammered for it. So I think that's a quality business, again, where we've seen this over punishment simply for delivering realistic news. Cyber is not going anywhere. Cybersecurity is absolutely here to stay. It is going to be a huge end market, by the way, for semiconductors and for upgraded chip requirements. So I want to go in on the best in class player, and that's Palo Alto.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/mag-7-experiencing-outsized-punishment-222434117.html
2024-03-07 22:13:32+00:00,15 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024,"In this article, we will list the 15 best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. If you want to sip our discussion about Apple's patent infringement, smartwatch market, and smartwatch ownership globally, go to the 7 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.A patent infringement case is pushing Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) to stop selling two of the most recent Apple Watch models, Series 9 and Ultra 2. The disputed component in these watches is the blood oxygen technology. The International Trade Center (ITC) ruled on October 2023 that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has infringed patents for pulse oximetry tech by Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a medical device manufacturer. The tech giant is trying to come up with a solution, but it seems like it will be a while before that happens. Given this ban, it is worth looking at some of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. The global smartwatch market is growing at a fast rate. It was valued at $33.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $90.4 billion by 2032, growing at a compounding annual growth rate of 10.5% during this period. The convenience of glancing at the wrist to stay informed about messages, calls, and important updates without picking up the phone is one of the biggest reasons for its market growth. Another pivotal factor propelling the smartwatch market is health and fitness. These watches provide a holistic approach to health management. They offer features such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout guidance. However, smartwatches do not come cheap, and their cost is one of the greatest hindrances in the growth of the global market.  There are many ways to segment the global smartwatch market, but one of the most common segregation is based on screen type. Currently, these watches are segmented into LCD and OLED according to the screen type, with OLED having a 91% share of the market.OLED has many advantages, which is why it is contributing to the overall growth of the market. Compared to LCD, it offers more vibrant colors and is more energy efficient.Another way to segment smartwatches is based on the application. These segments include running, notification checking, swimming, and cycling. The running segment takes the lion's share of 36%. Brand-wise, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is the largest player in the market with a 20% market share. Other major players include Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) and Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN).  Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) was founded in 1984 and went public in 1990. The company has been at the forefront of smartwatch technology, recently launching exclusive smartwatch capabilities like next-gen touchscreen technology and advancements in hybrid smartwatches. However, it is worth noting that Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) recently announced quitting the smartwatches market. Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) is a prominent company known for its innovative products and solutions. The company is known for its continuous innovation in the smartwatch industry. Some of the most popular smartwatches by Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) include the Gramin Venu 2, which ranks quite high on our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024. Currently, more than 200 million people use smartwatch globally. Like smartphone ownership in the US, men have a slight advantage as 23% of them use a smartwatch compared to 21.8% of women. It is worth noting here that ownership is the highest among internet users aged 25 to 34. Interestingly, within this age group, women are more likely to own a smartwatch. Of all internet-using people aged 25 to 34, 27.2% of women use a smartwatch as opposed to 26.9% of men. With that backdrop, let's look at the 15 best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024. A marathon runner wearing a company branded smartwatch, monitoring his performance in real-time.To curate our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024, we consulted 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the watch appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of watches in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 15/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the watch ranks on our list. The ranking factor is designed in a way that it is always positive but less than 1. So, if the Insider Monkey score of watch A is 3.75, 3 is its frequency, whereas 0.75 is its ranking factor. For comparison, if watch B had an Insider Monkey Score of 4.40, its frequency is 4, but overall it ranked lower than watch A on our sources. However, since we prioritize frequency, watch B ranks higher on our list. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Amazfit T Rex 2 is one of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.

2024-03-07 20:58:18+00:00,"Hey, Bottom Fishers! 3 Beaten Up Stocks to Buy for Short-Term Gains","One tool that bargain hunters can utilize to identify beaten up stocks to buy after significant declines is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI signals when a stock’s downward momentum may be exhausted, indicating that a correction could provide upside potential.Typically, an RSI reading below 30 is viewed as an ‘oversold’ level, suggesting the asset may be due to a rebound. However, the RSI alone is insufficient to conclude a buying opportunity exists in beaten up stocks to buy. A thorough review of the company’s financial position is prudent to evaluate whether value currently exists.The following three stocks have seen their share prices decline substantially recently. Although their RSIs indicate oversold conditions, their underlying business fundamentals still appear sound. This provides a potential for short-term gains for investors looking for certain beaten up stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Tada Images / ShutterstockAlbertsons (NYSE:ACI) has been heavily featured in the news lately, largely due to Kroger’s proposed merger announced in October 2022. However, the deal has faced significant obstacles. Recently, the FTC filed a lawsuit that has placed the merger’s fate in the hands of the judiciary. This has unsettled investors, sending the ACI lower to its 14-day RSI of 11.6.While a successful consummation of the Kroger deal could deliver substantial upside, Albertsons maintains robust financials even without the merger. Its latest Q3 earnings demonstrated this resiliency, with diluted EPS jumping over 300%. Due to its undervaluation and strong fundamentals, ACI could be considered one of the beaten up stocks to buy.Albertsons trades at a relatively low valuation, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.7x – less than half the broader U.S. grocery sector at 17.2x. This leaves the stock undervalued, representing one of the more compelling beaten up stocks to buy for patient investors.​Source: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.comMedifast (NYSE:MED) has been facing some headwinds lately. The weight loss and supplement company suffered from consumers’ ability to hire weight loss coaches and the arrival of Ozempic and other drugs. The most recent earnings missed expectations, weighing heavily on the price of this beaten up stock to buy. Management remains hopeful of a turnaround following a deal with LifeMD (NASDAQ:LFMD) to expand sales channels.The company’s shares dropped significantly, with its RSI reaching an oversold level of just 5.9. What’s interesting for potential investors is that Medifast trades at a P/E ratio of only 4.2x despite the earnings miss. The forward dividend yield stands at 17.4%, and the company increased its cash holdings. This indicates that the dividend is well covered and provides attractive value for investors in this beaten-up stock.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comEven major technology firms are not immune to market volatility, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders are now well aware. The iPhone maker experienced a difficult beginning in 2024 as sales in China and across the EU fell short of expectations. Apple’s stock price has dropped 12% this year, placing the company – a long-term favorite of Warren Buffett – in its most oversold position in six years at an RSI of just 22.1.While a business as large and well-established as Apple may not immediately spring to mind when considering beaten up stocks to buy, technical analysts note the current weakness presents investors with a potential buying opportunity to secure a high-quality business at a temporarily discounted valuation. Only time will tell if 2024 brings an uptick in fortunes for the technology titan. However, long-term backers will hope current headwinds prove a mere blip rather than the start of a longer-term downtrend.​Apple’s P/E ratio trades at just 26.3x, below the S&P 500‘s 27.7x. Investors may see the beaten up stock to buy as a good quality choice that will shine through in the longer run.On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07 20:28:00+00:00,Do These 2 Stocks Belong in the Magnificent 7?,"The so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ group, consisting of Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, and Amazon AMZN, has been a dominant story within the market for some time, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains.They’ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.However, two of the members in particular, Apple AAPL and Tesla TSLA, have come under scrutiny amid considerable underperformance relative to the rest of the group. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven their underperformance, should they be kicked out of the elite club? Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.Apple Apple hasn’t seen any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, with analysts lowering their expectations across multiple timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcerning headline figures in its latest release, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS totaled $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. In addition, Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and jumped 11.3% from the same period last year.Apple’s Services portfolio has been an excellent source of growth, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone. Nonetheless, shares fell following the report, attributed to demand worries in China. Sales in the region reached $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.Slowing growth has undoubtedly been reflected by the recent share performance, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 7% earnings growth on a marginal 0.6% sales increase. Still, shares are currently trading at their most oversold levels in years, undoubtedly worth keeping an eye on.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the company’s remarkable cash-generating abilities, established customer base, and news surrounding AI, the company’s long-term view remains bright. If positive earnings estimate revisions begin creeping in, shares will likely follow and move higher. TeslaOnce hailed as the poster child for growth stocks, Tesla’s share performance over the last year has left many investors with a sour taste. Lower margins, hybrid momentum, and competition in China have all been thorns in the side of the company.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe weak share performance has coincided with bearishness among analysts, with the company’s earnings outlook moving lower across all timeframes. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, the company continues to be the dominant EV player, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle in the world throughout 2023. And operations remain sound – Tesla posted $4.4 billion of free cash flow throughout its FY23 and saw its cost of goods sold per vehicle decline sequentially throughout its Q4.The company’s growth is forecasted to stall slightly in its current year (FY24), with consensus estimates alluding to 1.3% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. Growth resumes in a big way for FY25, as expectations presently suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 20% higher revenues.The stock remains a prime consideration for those bullish on the long-term EV picture, but analysts’ recent revisions reflect a cloudy near-term outlook.Bottom Line The ‘Magnificent 7’ has been on the minds of all investors, whose performance as a group has been remarkable.Still, two members of the club – Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL – are beginning to be shunned by the market, with the share performance of each over the last year lagging considerably.Both Tesla and Apple remain great long-term stocks, underpinned by fundamentals and operational execution. But recent performance has been anything but magnificent, especially when compared to the other members.It’s worth noting that many of the other Mag 7 members, including Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT, currently boast a much stronger earnings outlook. All four of these members presently sport a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), reflecting upward-trending earnings estimate revisions.The remaining member, Alphabet GOOGL, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen positive revisions across multiple timeframes as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-07 19:37:48+00:00,EU looking into Apple's decision to kill Epic Games' developer account,"The European Union has confirmed it's looking into Apple's decision to close Epic Games' developer account -- citing three separate regulations that may apply.Yesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month.Epic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as Fortnight on Apple's platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account.Responding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has ""requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.""The pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels' time today.The spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise compliance ""doubts"" with regard to two other regulations -- the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the platform-to-business regulation (P2B) -- given what they described as ""the links between the developer program membership and the App Store as designated VLOP"" (very large online platform).Rules the EU's DMA applies to Apple, as a designated ""gatekeeper"" and its App Store, as a so-called core platform service, require the company to permit third-party app stores. Failure to comply with the DMA risks major penalties -- of up to 10% of global annual turnover (or 20% for repeat offenders).While a subset of rules in the DSA, which also apply to Apple's App Store as a designated VLOP, have been in force for larger platforms since August 2023 -- with the rest of the regulation's provisions applying on platforms and many more digital services since last month. Penalties for breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover.The EU's P2B regulation, meanwhile, contains measures intended to boost platform transparency and curb unfair practices. It has been in force for longer (since 2020).Under the P2B law, sudden and unexpected account suspensions are banned, with platforms having to provide clear reasons for terminations. However, unlike the DMA and the DSA's regime for VLOPs, P2B enforcement is not the responsibility of the Commission. It's devolved to member state level authorities, which also determine any possible penalties for breaches. Although it's possible Commission enforcers may factor in whether platforms play nice with P2B rules as part of their assessment of VLOPs' DSA compliance, given there is some overlap in scope.Epic has claimed Apple terminated its developer account in retaliation for its criticism of the iPhone maker's DMA proposal, which requires developers to sign up to new T&Cs that include a new ""core technology"" in order to tap into DMA entitlements.Yesterday, Apple issued an aggressive statement in response -- hitting back at Epic's accusations and citing a U.S. court ruling as justification for terminating its account. It also claimed no executive had reviewed Epic's application to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, suggesting it was done via a click-through agreement.""Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,"" Apple wrote yesterday, citing a September 2021 U.S. court ruling pertaining to Epic’s litigation against Apple. The game maker sued Apple in the U.S., alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use its own payment systems.In September 2021, the U.S. court ruled Apple does not hold a monopoly in digital mobile gaming transactions. Although it did order it not to prohibit developers from adding links to their apps to direct users to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the purchase of digital goods.At the time, Apple trumpeted the judgment as a win -- saying the court had found the App Store does not violate antitrust law. The U.S. court also did not require Apple to allow third-party app stores or sideloading. However, under the EU's DMA, Apple is required to permit third-party app stores and third-party software downloads and must not block business users from offering wares through their own channels.The U.S. court ruling Apple is citing to justify terminating Epic's developer account is unlikely to have standing in the EU. However, Apple may be seeking to play one legal jurisdiction off against another -- which has decided its market power is a problem and already passed laws regulating how it can operate its App Store.Apple was contacted for a response to the Commission's request for further explanations of its actions under the DMA and to the doubts the bloc is raising about its compliance with other measures applied to the App Store by the DSA and P2B. It said it has nothing further to add to the remarks it made yesterday -- which argue the U.S. court ruling affirms its contractual right to terminate Epic's account.In those remarks, Apple noted the termination of Epic's account is not limited to the EU. It said its Developer Program License Agreements (DPLA) are global agreements; claimed Epic's breach of the DPLA agreement (via its ""hotfix"" patch, which sought to circumvent Apple's rules by covertly deploying code that let users purchase in-game currency) was also implemented around the world, including in Europe; and suggested the court injunction allowing termination is globally applicable.The company also noted Epic continues to litigate against it in the U.S. and Australia.Update: The EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has also now weighed in on the spat -- writing on X: ""Under the DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority."" He urged developers to get in touch with their feedback on gatekeepers' compliance.🚨Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers.I have asked our services to look into Apple’s termination of Epic’s developer account as a matter of priority.To all developers in 🇪🇺 & 🌍: now is the time to have your say on gatekeepers’…— Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) March 7, 2024Europe’s DMA rules for Big Tech explainedApple terminates Epic Games developer account calling it a ‘threat’ to the iOS ecosystemThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-epic-dev-account-dma/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/eu-looking-apples-decision-kill-102512197.html
2024-03-07 19:34:40+00:00,"Down, But Not Out: 7 Stocks With Massive Comeback Potential","Some of the top stocks are down right now, but don’t write them off just yet. Instead, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.The reasons for the declines are many and include weak guidance for the year ahead, problems in overseas markets such as China, and declining spending on the part of consumers. While notable, these issues are by no means insurmountable and it is unlikely that many of the leading companies will see their share prices stay down for long.As such, investors would be smart to pounce on the stocks while the share price is still in the red. After all, the goal remains to buy low and sell high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany companies whose stocks are down currently recognize the problems they’re experiencing and are taking proactive steps to fix the issues, with some companies announcing ambitious, multi-year growth strategies. Again, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is having a tough time right now. Year-to-date, the consumer electronics giant’s share price is down 8%. That compares to a 7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index so far in 2024.The company’s share price is declining on growing concerns about sales of its signature devices. Mostly the iPhone. And mostly in China. AAPL stock just got rocked by a report from Counterpoint Research that showed Apple’s iPhone sales in China declined 24% during the first six weeks of the year.While the Chinese market, and iPhone sales, are areas of concern, there are still plenty of reasons to be bullish on the company and its stock. The services side of Apple’s business (streaming, banking and apps) are more than making up for declines in sales of the company’s hardware. Apple’s earnings continue to beat Wall Street estimates. And the company has just launched a brand new electronic device with its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. And Apple is now turning its attention to artificial intelligence (AI).Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another leading technology company whose stock is down this year. Since the start of January, GOOGL fell about 4%.Unfortunately, its value dropped 8% in the last month after Alphabet launched a defective AI image generator that drew much scorn on social media. The AI image launch was so bad that even Google co-founder Sergey Brin publicly criticized it, saying that the company “definitely messed up.”The poorly received image generator has heightened concerns that Alphabet is falling behind in the AI race, sending its stock lower.However, investors would be foolish to count out Alphabet. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just put out a note urging clients to stick with GOOGL stock. JPMorgan says that Alphabet will get its AI program back on track and any backlash against the company will be short lived. JPMorgan adds that Alphabet has the resources and talent to close the AI gap with its rivals.Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comIt’s an extremely tough time to be a shareholder of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Since the start of the year, TSLA stock has plummeted 27%. The company’s stock has been the sixth worst performer in the S&P 500 index so far this year. The drop comes amid rising concerns about demand for electric vehicles. While the entire EV market is experiencing a downturn, the impact has been especially damaging at Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle sales.Like Apple, Tesla is having a particularly difficult time in China, where an economic slowdown has led consumers to put off motor vehicle purchases, particularly pricey electric vehicles. TSLA stock recently fell 7% in a single day on news that the company’s EV sales in China have fallen to their lowest level in more than a year. While Tesla certainly faces what look to be long-term challenges, its important to remember that the stock has been here before — several times.Between November 2021 and January 2023, TSLA stock fell 72% only to come roaring back. Company CEO Elon Musk retains a devoted following among retail investors.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comShares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) were clobbered after the company’s recent earnings print. The cybersecurity firm’s share price fell nearly 30%, for its worst one-day performance ever, after management lowered their full-year guidance for both revenue and billings.The downbeat guidance completely overshadowed the fact that Palo Alto Networks beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results, reporting earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of $1.98 billion.Senior executives at the company did their best to explain that the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. Unfortunately, nobody seemed to listen beyond the news that the company lowered its guidance for the year ahead.In time, this will all be smoothed out and Palo Alto’s AI strategy will be made clear. There are already signs of a recovery, with PANW stock having moved 11% higher from its post-earnings bottom.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has restarted talks with the union that is organizing workers at its U.S. stores and says it is willing to negotiate labor agreements. This approach can only help SBUX stock, which is down 13% over the past 12 months and near a 52-week low.Up until now, Starbucks had fought unionization drives at its stores that began in 2021, and the issue has harmed the company’s reputation and share price. Starbucks has also been hurt by a boycott in the U.S. and increased discounting by rivals in overseas markets, notably China.However, there is reason for optimism with SBUX. Not only is Starbucks taking a proactive approach to labor relations, but the company has also unveiled details of a strategic plan that will see the retail coffee chain open 17,000 new locations by 2030 even as it cuts $3 billion in costs. Management at Starbucks is being assertive on all fronts.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) also has a strategy to help it grow in coming years. In December, the quick service restaurant chain announced a plan to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. Those targets are part of the company’s plans to grow its worldwide sales and boost its stock price, which is down 2% year to date after trading sideways over the past 12 months.McDonald’s has also announced plans to attract and retain customers with revamped versions of its burgers and chicken nuggets. For this year, McDonald’s is projecting net new restaurant growth of 4%. After next year, the company plans to grow its restaurant count by 5% annually. By 2027, the company wants to have 50,000 restaurant locations globally. To reach that goal, McDonald’s plans to open 900 new locations in America, 1,900 restaurants internationally, and 7,000 units in developing markets.The company is also testing a new spin-off brand called “CosMc’s” that is aimed at teens and twentysomethings. The growth strategy is a big reason to believe in a comeback for MCD stock.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comShares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) hit the skids. The athletic apparel company, known for its yoga pants and workout clothes, saw its share price fall 12% so far in 2024. The selloff comes after the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the final quarter of last year, which included the year-end holiday shopping period. However, there is reason to believe that LULU stock can get up off the mat and rise again.First, the company has since revised up its fourth quarter 2023 sales and profit forecasts on strong sales during the holidays. Lululemon next reports earnings on March 26. Second, Lululemon is expanding into a new market segment with the launch of men’s sneakers. The company says it wants to gain market share in the male sportswear segment after dominating in the women’s market. The men’s footwear includes two running shoes and a casual sneaker that hit stores on Feb. 13 of this year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

2024-03-07 19:26:30+00:00,Europe's DMA rules for Big Tech explained,"The Digital Markets Act (DMA), an ex ante European Union reform of digital competition rules, will be in force today, by midnight Brussels' time, on six tech giants -- applying a new set of legal requirements on more than 20 of their ""core platform services"" (CPS).Online empires that scaled in an era of minimal interventions from regulators, shaping the commercial web as we know it, are now facing a prescriptive set of rules on how they can operate and do business in the EU, including hard limits on their use of data; interoperability mandates; and bans on self-preferencing.The six companies designated under the DMA so far -- as so-called Internet ""gatekeepers"" -- are: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft.Read on for an overview of the new law, its early impacts on platforms and Big Tech, and how it might change digital business as we know it, starting in Europe...The aim of the pan-EU regulation is -- essentially -- to crack open Big Tech's market power. The DMA shoots to make digital markets fairer and more contestable by applying a set of up-front obligations and restrictions on the kingpin players entrenched atop digital markets. Such as -- for example -- a ban on Google's self-preferencing in search results; or on Amazon using rivals' data to feed its own retail product development; or on Meta processing user data for ad targeting without people's consent; or a ban on Apple banning third party app stores from its mobile platform, iOS.Data portability and interoperability are key planks of the regime -- which also, for example, requires Meta to open up its WhatsApp and Messenger platforms to rival services to allow cross-platform access. Idea being smaller messaging apps can offer their users the ability to reach people using those dominant messaging networks without having to sign up for an account with their gatekeeper.EU lawmakers generally want the DMA to foster service switching and ""multihoming"" to reduce Big Tech's grip on web users' eyeballs and wallets, unlocking the chance for competitors to get a look in. Put another way, the phenomenon of online services evolving into self-reinforcing ecosystems and empires, through network effects and gatekeeper lock-in tactics, is the centrifugal force the DMA is attacking with a range of pro-competition countermeasures targeted at strategic gateways, like app stores, operating systems and web browsers.Whether the regulation will actually succeed in loosening dominant platform operators' grip on digital markets is uncertain. But the EU is going to try.The main DMA criteria for a platform being deemed an ""important gateway"" for business users to reach end users, and whose entrenched owner/operator has a ""significant impact"" on the EU's internal market, is annual revenue of at least €7.5 billion in each of the last three financial years or a market cap of at least €75 billion in the last financial year. A gatekeeper must also provide the same CPS in at least three EU Member States; and these platforms must have at least 45 million monthly active users regionally and at least 10,000 business users.The bloc has given itself some wiggle room to designate ""emerging"" gatekeepers, too -- if the Commission believes a platform will gain an entrenched and durable market position in the near future it can also impose some rules, with the aim of preventing that outcome.The DMA's sizeable ambition is backed up with serious teeth, too: The regulation allows for penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover for breaches -- or even 20% for repeat offences. So we're talking fines that could run to tens of billions of dollars apiece.Oversight and enforcement responsibility is centralized with the European Commission. This is an attempt to streamline enforcement and avoid the patchy outcomes we've seen with other EU digital regulations, thanks to variable resourcing and forum shopping. However this approach piles complex and high stakes work on the EU's executive -- so one question is whether the bloc might have bitten off more than it can chew?The DMA does allow for private enforcement, too, in the form of litigation targeting non-compliance -- so gatekeepers could face being sued in European courts over unfair practices if they fail to get with the program.Currently, the six gatekeepers' regulated CPS span a number of techno playing fields -- namely: Social networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn); “intermediation” services (Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Amazon Marketplace, iOS App Store, Meta Marketplace); ads delivery systems (Google, Amazon and Meta); browsers (Chrome, Safari); operating systems (Google Android, iOS, Windows PC OS); N-IICS or Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger); search engines (Google); and video sharing platforms (YouTube).The regulation allows for CPS to be designated in other tech arenas too, such as cloud computing services and virtual assistants. But so far none have been named in those domains -- and cloud computing is one notable early gap (especially given the role hyperscalers like Microsoft are playing in the fast developing generative AI market).Asked about the cloud computing designation gap, the Commission told us the DMA is built on a system of self-assessment which requires platforms to notify it when they consider they meet the regulation's thresholds -- which no cloud operator has so far done.""At this stage we do not have elements to question this self-assessment,"" the Commission spokesperson said, adding they will ""continue to monitor market developments"" in cloud -- and also emphasizing the current tally of six gatekeepers (and 22 CPS) is ""only the start, not the end"". More gatekeepers and/or CPS may well be added to the list soon. Reports earlier this month said social media firm X, TikTok's parent ByteDance's ads business and European online travel agency Booking.com have notified the Commission of reaching the regulation's usage thresholds -- suggesting they could progress to being designated in the coming months. (The Commission told us it has 45 working days to take a decision on this trio of potential designations.)It's worth noting a number of gatekeepers are also challenging their designations in the bloc's courts. (Three so far: Apple, Meta and TikTok.) So it's at least possible some platforms could convince judges they don't qualify as entrenched gatekeepers and be struck off the list. (ByteDance, for instance, is arguing it should be seen as a Big Tech challenger, given its relative newness on the scene vs longer in the tooth tech giants. But it remains to be seen what EU courts will make of the argument.)Some tech giants have also deployed counterarguments that have been successful at avoiding designations. For example, the Commission recently decided against adding Apple's iMessage, Microsoft Advertising, its search engine Bing and web browser Edge to the list -- after accepting arguments their respective services are not popular enough to qualify.Last year the Commission also decided against designating Samsung's internet browser, despite the company notifying the EU it hit DMA usage thresholds -- with the bloc assessing it did not hold the necessary gateway position in the browser category. The EU also chose not to designate webmail providers, Gmail and Outlook, at that time, accepting counterarguments against their intermediating market power too.The bloc's intention has always been for the DMA to be tightly focused -- on only the most powerful gatekeeping giants. However one early (political) charge levelled at the EU's approach is it puts restrictions and obligations on (only) foreign (and mostly U.S.) tech giants.This attack tactic is one that seems particularly weak and unlikely to trouble Brussels. If digital market power is concentrated offshore then a regulation that aims to rebalance tipped digital markets must, necessarily, shoot at offshore targets. And it's fair to say U.S. lawmakers have themselves raised plenty of concerns about homegrown platforms' market power in recent years.In any case, European platforms that build enough momentum to fall into scope face becoming regulated, too -- as Booking.com may soon be.In recent weeks we've seen a range of moves by gatekeepers in claimed preparation for compliance with the DMA. Apple's new ""core tech fee"" on iOS and opening up to non-WebKit-based browsers in the EU, for instance, or Google tweaking how it displays some search results and quietly switching off default cross-service tracking of its own users.Meta has also given a glimpse of work to roll out messaging interoperability to WhatsApp and Messenger. That particular strand of the regulation will take time to bear fruit as in-scope messaging platforms get three months to respond to interoperability requests. So how effective and user-friendly these implementations will be remains to be seen.The regulation also allows for a phased rollout of messaging interoperability, with only basic functionalities (texting, image/video and file sharing and asynchronous voice messages between two individual users) required initially. Group messaging interoperability isn't required until two years after a gatekeeper designation; while a full four years has been allowed for platforms to put in place interoperability for video and voice calling, between individual users and groups.At the same time, Meta looks to be attempting a direct swerve of other DMA requirements, aimed at reforming privacy-hostile business models, by concocting a version of consent that requires users to pay literal money if they want to avoid being tracked and profiled.So, in short, the early picture is mixed, with so many pieces in flux and uncertainty over how exactly the law will be enforced. It'll likely take time before we see how much market transformation the DMA is actually driving.While some early moves by tech giants look significant and could create interesting new opportunities for competition and innovation, others are obviously cynical and self-serving -- showing entrenched platform giants doing their level best to avoid having to end exploitative practices and/or reform entire business models.Days out from the DMA compliance deadline we're also seeing some editing of compliance proposals in response to early criticism. Such as Apple removing certain requirements it had said it would impose on developers wanting to take up entitlements, after they complained it was making it too arduous for them to tap into the new opportunities.Bear in mind, whatever gatekeepers' blog posts and briefings claim on DMA compliance, it'll be up to Commission to assess whether or not they're meeting the legal bar. So we're not going to get a clear picture of how digital markets will actually change until we start to see how and where the EU will take enforcement action to rein in gatekeeper flexes and tackle competitive pinch-points.This also means there's likely to be ongoing PR war, involving both the gatekeepers themselves and their fiercest critics, as each side seeks to shape the narrative about what's real or fake compliance. (See, for instance, Spotify's immediate decrying of Apple's reworked iOS fee structure and Apple's aggressive pushback by putting a spotlight on the scale of Spotify's app business success. Or Epic Games claiming yesterday that Apple terminated its iOS developer account after it criticized its DMA proposal as ""malicious compliance"". So get the popcorn in.)The Commission is actively calling for stakeholders to send feedback on DMA compliance moves to support its assessment of gatekeepers. Effective oversight will clearly require an industry-wide effort. To this end, it's organized a series of workshops in Brussels later this month when it wants tech giants to sit around a table and discuss compliance, face to face, with business users.How -- or even whether -- gatekeepers engage in good faith with this EU process will be fascinating to watch. Although they must make their compliance reports public. But if platforms refuse to turn up in person to defend their compliance approaches they'll be leaving their loudest critics to bend EU enforcers' ears unchallenged. This means gatekeepers are facing a bit of a Hobson's choice that, for once, is not of their own dark pattern design.The workshop set-up looks cleverly conceived by the Commission as a tactic to compel gatekeepers into dialogue (and potentially concessions) about compliance shortcomings. Whoever best engages with the EU may have the strongest chance of cementing compliance narratives that sway DMA enforcers.At the same time, tech giants remain exceptionally well resourced, employing armies of lawyers who will have been tasked with poring over the detail of the DMA to find weak spots and loopholes they can exploit to minimize damage to commercial self-interest. Legal challenges to enforcement decisions look highly likely. Which means the Commission will have to divert resources into defensive action, too, and there's a risk of the regime getting bogged down in litigation as time goes on.Judging by early compliance proposals, some gatekeepers appear to have calculated they'd rather take their chances in the courts -- and risk hefty DMA non-compliance fines -- than willingly dismantle lucrative business-as-usual on Day 1 of this New Online World Order. So far, for example, both Apple and Google have indicated they plan to keep charging fees even if app developers selling digital goods on their mobile platforms make use of DMA-enabled opportunities to point their users to cheaper offers outside the gatekeepers' stores to complete transactions. Bottom line: Rent demands won't stop tomorrow. So expect the likes of Spotify and Epic Games to keep crying foul.Since the DMA does not ban gatekeepers from charging fees for their services, nor stipulate a set formula for rates -- beyond requirements to have T&Cs that are FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) -- platform giants may feel confident they have a strong case that the fees they charge are fair and reasonable given how much technology and market access their platforms provide.However, in recent days, the Commission has signalled it may be preparing to take action over complaints about unfair fees. Speaking earlier this week, as she hit Apple with an almost $2 billion fine over anti-steering on the music streaming market, the EU's competition chief and EVP for digital matters, Margrethe Vestager, said “novel fee structures” should not be used as a tactic to undermine incentives for developers to do something else.In another example of early DMA friction, look to Meta's bid to force consent from EU users via imposing a 'pay or be tracked' choice on users of Facebook and Instagram, both now designated CPS. The adtech giant's apparent refusal to reform its business model, even with the DMA coming into view, follows years of complaints over its unlawful processing of user data under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Two other legal bases Meta had claimed for the ads processing were overturned last year -- forcing a switch to consent. But instead of giving users a free choice to deny tracking, Meta concocted a controversial ad-free subscription choice that puts Facebook and Instagram users in a privacy bind.It will therefore be very interesting to see what the Commission does about this -- now DMA gatekeeper's -- attempt to redefine EU law around consent to fit its commercial self interest. ""Gatekeepers should not design, organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of end users to freely give consent,"" runs the regulation's recitals vis-a-vis ""personalized advertising"". The law also stipulates: ""Not giving consent should not be more difficult than giving consent.""Earlier this month, the bloc sent Meta a request for information about its ad-free subscription under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act (DSA) -- which also puts limits on the use of people's data for ads (and came into force on Meta's business last August). So the EU is already scrutinizing Meta's consent model. How they act on such an obvious privacy abuse with the DMA also in force will be one to watch.Elsewhere, gatekeepers appear to be accepting some of the operational writing on the wall. In recent days, for example, a number of the tech giants have been announcing data portability APIs. We've also had notice of incoming choice screens -- from Apple and Google -- which EU lawmakers hope will open up competition in web browser and search markets.While the devil will be in the detail of how these screens are designed, and when and where they pop up, some early responses are sounding positive.Eco search engine, Ecosia, has described Google as a ""collaborative partner"" during the design process for the incoming search choice screen, for example. ""There is now a unique opportunity for alternative search engines such as Ecosia -- with less than 0.1% of the global market share (compared to Google’s 92%) -- to take full advantage of these improved market conditions and openness,"" Sophie Dembinski, its head of public policy and climate action, noted in a statement this week.On the flip side, privacy search engine and browser, DuckDuckGo, got in touch to tell us it's radically unimpressed by Google's initial offer.""By deciding to only show a choice screen when people are setting up an Android device for the first time, Google is artificially limiting how many people are even exposed to a choice screen -- for Android, that is a 3% to 5% of the total user base per quarter, bringing in frustratingly slow change to the market,"" it wrote in a briefing note circulated to press this week. ""The process is broken. Gatekeepers shouldn’t be in a position to propose solutions to problems they created. Third party experts should be involved in the compliance process from the get-go, with rapid iterations on implementation to reach mutually agreed KPIs.""DuckDuckGo argues the DMA demands far more meaningful reform on default choices -- saying Google must make it persistently easy for consumers to switch default choices, rather than just popping up occasional choice screens. So this is another fight where the Commission will have to not so much pick a side as choose where the compliance line lies.Also on the negative side, mobile developers are decrying what they dub Apple's ""scare screens"" -- aka, notifications the iOS maker intends to pop up to warn users of the risks of transacting outside its App Store. But the DMA does allow gatekeepers to take ""necessary and proportionate"" measures to safeguard user security. So the Commission may even be dragged into refereeing the substance and tone of these sort of user-facing comms.How the Commission handles its new role as gatekeeper enforcer remains to be seen. But one wider effect the DMA looks to be having is inspiring lawmakers elsewhere to pass similar laws so users in other countries can tap into opportunities that can be seen unfolding in the EU as the bloc has a go at taming Big Tech.The so-called ""Brussels' effect"" leading to DMA copycats is already being discussed. ""We're seeing copycats around the world already,"" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Washington-based thinktank the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), which counts a number of gatekeepers among its members, speaking during a press briefing this week. ""We're seeing copies of this Digital Markets Act or variations of it appear in places like Japan, the U.K., Brazil, Mexico, even India... So, I think, in the democratic world, it will become the de facto standard.""""A decade ago, you would have said the tech companies were sort of like teenagers and they really didn't face much regulation. And now they're grown ups and they are going to be regulated -- a little bit like banks, telecoms and other industries that have a tremendous impact on our lives and on the economy,"" he added.The short answer is it depends. Even if gatekeepers do everything that's demanded by their fiercest critics and crack open the gates of their ecosystems to unleash new and exciting opportunities for competitors, it will still require end users to take a sustained interest in alternative apps and services.If there's no uptake, and users prefer to stick with branded wares from familiar tech giants, the DMA's high profile goal of unlocking competition and innovation will fall flat. The Commission itself is well aware of this risk.""What the DMA is really about is to ensure fairness and contestability -- provide for choice and opportunities -- but it's also important that those choices and opportunities are taken up and exercised. Otherwise we may not see changes in every area where we would want to see them because very often it will depend on take up,"" warned Denis Sparas, deputy head of unit at DG CNECT, in the European Commission, during a DMA-focused panel discussion earlier this week organized by the European Digital SME Alliance.""I think there is a ground to be optimistic,"" he added. ""What we see are quite significant improvements, compared to what we have initially seen as the proposed compliance solutions -- and these improvements will result in tangible changes. Having said that, many of these changes also depend on the fact that choices and opportunities which will be provided are also taken up.""Take Google: The tech giant routinely defends itself against charges that it's unfairly self-preferencing its own products at the expense of rivals by claiming its apps are popular simply because they provide users with the best utility. Unsurprisingly, then, it has sought to frame the DMA as anti-user -- suggesting the law will reduce convenience for web users who, it implies, are most likely to find changes it enforces annoying.Apple also maintains that its mobile ecosystem offers users the strongest privacy and security -- similarly arguing, therefore, that the EU regulation is anti-user as it's essentially forcing it to degrade the quality of products it can provide to Europeans.Expect these sorts of arguments to persist. And there is a clear risk of gatekeepers deploying changes in a way that's designed to generate more unwelcome friction for users in a bid to -- both -- undermine support for the regulation and work against the intended competition-boosting effect by making it difficult for people to use alternatives.Add to that, there will be more pop-ups arriving on the back of this EU law -- whether giving users a choice to obtain more privacy by denying platforms' ability to link their data across accounts; letting them pick from a choice of browsers or search engines to set as their default; or warning they're headed 'off world' and transacting elsewhere means they're no longer under the platform's own customer support and refund rules. These notifications will be an obvious target for the law's critics. And may well annoy a bunch of users.It's also quite possible that a lot of web users are happy with what Big Tech provides them. And simply aren't interested in alternatives. But the DMA does at least offer a way to test platform controllers' arguments that they're only popular because they're the best -- and see whether, on a more level playing field, there is appetite for more variety in digital services.A few extra pop-ups seem like a worthwhile trade-off for the chance to reconfigure some of the self-serving incentives that have shaped the commercial web for decades. And even, potentially, reform entirely exploitative business models.One cautionary note here: Years of EU antitrust enforcement on Google has failed to dent its regional market dominance and fire up rival tech like search engines, despite the imposition of interventions like choice screens. However that earlier competition action was undertaken under classic antitrust laws, where enforcement is slow and reactive. Whereas the aim for the DMA is to flip the odds by setting rules up front that outlaw a bunch of unfair lock-in tactics.The bloc hopes this ex ante approach will finally be able to deliver a genuine competition reboot. One aspect hasn't change though: It's still up to gatekeepers to design their own compliance -- so attempts to game the rules or just implement the narrowest possible solutions are a given.That said, given it's already so late to reset Big Tech's market power, the EU is facing huge pressure to act quickly to tackle the most egregious DMA abuses. The Commission is starting on the back foot, facing -- per its own assessment -- a set of entrenched gatekeepers. This should concentrate minds in Brussels on the need to move fast and make DMA enforcement count. But with so much the EU could arbitrate here it's also likely Commission enforcers will pick their battles. So where DMA enforcement falls first will be really interesting to watch -- as it will set the tone for the bloc's approach.Gatekeepers that have opted for a defiant and even aggressive stance (hi Apple!) could just be putting themselves first in the firing line. Gatekeepers whose business models are already subject to charges of systematic non-compliance with EU law (hey Meta!) should also be worried. And while Google may generally play a slicker PR game, it has a very high level of exposure to the DMA on account of how many of its platforms are designated. The EU has also signalled a willingness to contemplate structural remedies in Google's case, warning last year, when it issued a statement of objections for suspected anti-competitive conduct of its adtech business, that the only viable remedy, if a breach of the law ends up being confirmed, is to split Google up.While we'll have to wait and see how exactly DMA enforcement will play out, one thing is clear: There is plenty of appetite in Europe for a crackdown on Big Tech, both among small businesses and web users.""There are some gatekeepers that put certain proposals that are really designed purely in bad faith,"" said Jurgita Misevičiutė, public policy lead at the privacy-focused app maker Proton, during the same panel discussion on the DMA this week. ""We really call on the European Commission... to be really bold and to take swift and strong action against such gatekeepers, because developers, the industry, they don't have another 5 to 10 years to wait until compliance happens.""Asked where it thinks DMA enforcement should fall first, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) told us it wants the Commission to apply ""urgent scrutiny"" on Meta and Apple. “We have real concerns that on D-Day of the Digital Markets Act, some gatekeepers will not comply with the rules they have known about for years now,"" said Agustin Reyna, its director for legal and economic affairs. ""It is really important that the Commission sends a clear signal that this is serious and unacceptable.""Some cases require urgent scrutiny. For example, Meta’s data practices, from what we have seen so far, might violate the DMA, while Apple’s announcements about how they plan to comply with the DMA are clearly insufficient. The Commission has to open infringement proceedings if non-compliant gatekeepers do not adapt their practices immediately.""As noted above, the Commission is under considerable pressure to ensure a flagship digital reform delivers results. So there is absolutely a sense of urgency in Brussels.During Tuesday's SME Alliance panel discussion, DG CNECT's Sparas responded to concerns the Commission may not move quick enough to tackle Big Tech by emphasizing that its thinking on enforcement does not involves timeframes that run to years -- rather he suggested it's going to be a matter of ""days, weeks and months"".The letter of the law states market investigations to consider system non-compliance can take up to 12 months, with up to six months allowed for the Commission to deliver preliminary conclusions. But interim measures may allow for swifter action -- where the Commission determines there is ""urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable damage for business users or end users of gatekeepers"", as the regulation puts it.Also speaking during the SME Alliance panel discussion, Johnny Ryan, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties' senior fellow and director of its Enforce division which focuses on enforcing humans rights on technology, urged the Commission to unbox these interim measures powers stat to tackle long-standing Big Tech abuses.""There is a clear line to how you impose interim measures if you go through the GDPR -- which of course the Commission can under the DMA,"" he suggested. ""I would urge the Commission to be moving as fast as possible... to mark an investigation of systematic non compliance under Article 18(1).""If the EU hits the ground running -- applying interim measures and opening investigations of systematic non-compliance -- it would ""signal with action, not words, that it is fully prepared to take serious measures, including structural remedies"", Ryan added.During the panel, Sparas said the Commission won't always use ""the most far reaching measures"" -- suggesting the EU is hoping the regulation, as a whole, works to reform gatekeepers' behavior simply on merit of having heavily cranked up their regulatory risk.The DMA does allow gatekeepers to offer -- and the Commission to accept -- commitments to address concerns on an ongoing basis, i.e. rather than waiting for formal enforcement. So the EU will want to keep up pressure on platforms to proactively address complaints, such as via the forthcoming public workshops.EU enforcers also have powers to request information and conduction on-site inspections. The bloc can also always raise the temperature by getting commissioners to issue public warnings about issues of concern, as we've seen happening in recent weeks, too, as compliance proposals have emerged.It may be hoping gatekeepers opt to tweak ops in contested areas to avoid the risk of formal DMA proceedings, given the potential for hefty sanctions at the end. And, again in recent days -- so still ahead of the DMA actually applying -- we've seen some instances of editing to compliance proposals in the face of pushback, such as Apple tweaking some of the requirements on developers to take up entitlements. The Commission has also emphasized that proposals have improved vs the first iterations gatekeepers came with last year. So some platform reforms may happen quickly.However, as DMA Compliance Day has loomed, gatekeepers have largely been entrenching on their most heavily criticized positions -- such as Apple and Google's app store fees or Meta's 'consent or pay' model. This suggests the biggest -- potentially most transformative -- reforms of Big Tech business models aren't likely to happen unless the Commission takes formal enforcement. So the baton passes back to the bloc to drive real change.Where non-compliance is ""very blatant"" Sparas emphasized the EU ""will need to act very quickly"".""One thing that we have learned, for good or bad, is that if we want to really make a change here it is very important that we act quickly,"" he said, adding: ""Of course still in a legally sound way. But [we need] to act quickly and effectively. Because otherwise, as we said at the time of the [DMA] proposal, many of these markets are prone to very quick tipping. So... if we take too much time, things may change to a point where it's very difficult to change things back.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/europes-dma-rules-big-tech-140528903.html
2024-03-07 19:19:00+00:00,3 Standout Tech Stocks to Buy Down at Least 15%,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion. ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.Apple (AAPL) Apple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s (NVDA) 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.Block Inc. (SQ)Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.  Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average. The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-07 19:15:33+00:00,Apple M3 MacBook Air review: Still the best Mac for most,"Before we go any further, a question: What makes a computer an AI computer? Is it simply the ability to execute AI-powered tasks? To run LLMs locally? Is it something deeper? Is any computer that is capable of running any form of artificial intelligence/machine learning fundamentally an AI computer?It’s a simple question on the face of it. But the truth is, we’ll probably never have a satisfying answer. Still, it’s important to calibrate as we head deeper into the year of ""AI everything.""If you’ve been playing along at home, you weren’t too surprised when Apple humbly crowned the new M3 MacBook Air as the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI” in a recent press release. The qualifications “laptop” and “consumer” are primarily meant to distinguish the new notebooks from other Apple products, which one assumes are the best AI desktop and laptop, respectively.It's not so much that there’s anything inherent to this update that makes the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air an AI powerhouse, per Apple's description. Rather, it’s the implication that the building blocks have been there the whole time -- specifically in the form of the Neural Engine. This element has been a fixture of Mac silicon for years but often gets overshadowed by the CPU and GPU, which are generally easier for both consumers and reviewers to wrap their brains around.The feature is harder to quantify in terms of real-world performance versus, say, a graphics chip but is perhaps best understood as something along the lines of a GPU targeting machine learning. It's been clear for some time that this will be an increasingly essential aspect of day-to-day computing, a fact that the arrival of ChatGPT and its ilk has brought into sharp focus for many consumers.Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is leaning so heavily into the concept for the same reason Samsung positioned the S24 as the industry’s first “AI phone” and why Google referred to the Pixel 8 Pro as “the first smartphone with AI built in” last year: zeitgeist. These are marketing concepts to a large extent, but they're a good barometer for where the industry's collective head is at.The sudden explosion of generative AI has transformed artificial intelligence from abstract and theoretical to concrete and tangible for many. Naturally, everyone wants a piece of it. You can expect Apple to lean into the notion even more heavily when the iPhone 16 launches later this year. After all, machine learning has been an important aspect of features like computational photography for some time.As of right now, however, Apple can’t tell exactly the story it wants to tell. The company's generative AI narrative is -- at the moment -- one of delayed gratification. During Apple’s most recent quarterly earnings call, Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” in the generative AI field, adding, “We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is no doubt investing boatloads into the category, even funneling members of its ill-fated automotive team into the space. Given the head start currently enjoyed by the competition, however, hardware is something Apple can point to in the here and now. Some of this also likely stems from the fact that the new Airs aren’t fundamentally new pieces of hardware. Rather, they’re refreshes with new(ish) silicon.That’s to be expected. The Mac line has seen a LOT of change over the past four years. All of that work came together in a brilliant way with last year’s Air models. I don’t hesitate to call them the best consumer laptop Apple has ever made. Depending on where your operating system allegiances lie, it’s not a stretch to call them the best laptops for most people, full stop. They’re not perfect -- sacrificing certain “Pro” features for the sake of weight and size has been a longtime feature of the line -- but many or most of them are things the average consumer won’t realize are missing.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe 2023 Air benefited greatly from Apple’s work on first-party silicon through the M line of chips, coupled with learning from past stumbles like faulty keyboards and the largely DOA Touch Bar. The end product felt like precisely the MacBook so many of us wanted for so long: lightweight and powerful, with great battery life and a reasonable (in Mac terms) price point, starting at $1,099 for the 13- and $1,299 for the 15-inch. If anything, the line has cemented the Pro as a niche product by comparison, as the Air has replaced the standard MacBook as the model for most.As a professional writer, I consider myself to be in a fairly creative field. I record and edit podcasts every week, along with the occasional video. I get to test all sorts of laptops for this gig, and I keep coming back to the Air. Certainly my frequent work travel plays a considerable role in the tech I choose, along with some newfound degenerative back problems.For my money, the 15-inch model gracefully balances the line between screen size and portability. At 3.3 pounds, it never felt like a burden carrying on my back all last week at Mobile World Congress and (don’t tell the Delta flight attendant), it sits comfortably in the seatback pocket.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThere are really only two things that make me miss the Pro at all. The first is the port problem. Both Air models have a pair of USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports next to the MagSafe connector. There are times when things get bunched up over there, making me miss the 16-inch Pro’s three ports. That in itself isn’t enough to get me to switch. Nor, for that matter, are the times I miss having an SD slot. Dongles are a pain, but they’re very much part of the modern condition in Apple land. If I was constantly shooting with an SLR, however, I would likely be telling a different story.Now, the port math changes considerably depending on your home/office setup. I’m lucky (or, perhaps, foolish) enough to have a desktop system at home. Much like the Pro models, this is probably overkill for many or most, especially when factoring in (1) cost and (2) the fact that the M3 chip has support for two external monitors.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe iPad may have eaten into Mac's market share among more casual users, but as the laptop line has gotten more powerful, it's supplanted the need for a devoted desktop for many. There's great versatility in a device you can travel the world with, take home and dock into a pair of external monitors. In the case of the Studio Display, the process is as simple as connecting to the Thunderbolt port and closing the laptop hood. Not much configuration is needed beyond that, and suddenly you've got a ton of screen real estate and an array of freed up ports on the backs of the monitors.Given the power and performance of even the standard M3, there really is not a compelling reason not to. This is one of the great paradoxes of Apple silicon: The more powerful it becomes at the base, the more niche the high-end devices become for most users.The only real caveat to all of this is gaming. Apple would never have admitted it, but the $300 billion-odd industry has been an afterthought for most of the Mac’s life. In spite of an early advantage, Apple was lapped and ultimately left behind by the industry. For decades, gaming on the Mac seemed like a lost cause. If you wanted to play anything much more complicated than solitaire, you bought a Windows machine or console. This isn’t to say that Apple’s caught up by any meaningful metric (the gaming library still can't hold a candle to Windows), but a combination of first-party silicon, Metal and development for the iPhone has, at the very least, put the company back in the conversation for those who want to move beyond mobile.If gaming is your number one raison d'être, a Mac probably isn’t on your list. If, however, AAA gaming is a slice of your overall computer needs, you can reasonably have that itch scratched. It’s true that the macOS library still pales in comparison to Windows, but Apple has begun remedying that with some day and date releases from big-name studios.Image Credits: AppleThe M3 arrived last year as part of Apple’s “Scary Fast” (it was the day before Halloween, mind) event. The company bucked its standard silicon release cadence by introducing three versions at once: the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. One gets the sense that ramping up production, coupled with the ongoing supply chain issues of the past four years, has done a number on the release road map.A refreshed 24-inch iMac was the recipient of the base M3, while new MacBook Pros got the M3, Pro and Max. The base M3 features an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU (upgradable to 10-core) and 16-core neural engine. Both the 13- and 15-inch models have 8GB of RAM by default, configurable up to 24GB. Likewise, the 256GB of storage goes up to 2TB.Image Credits: Brian HeaterIn fact, beyond display size (technically 13.6- and 15.3-inch, respectively) and starting price, there’s not much in the way of distinction between the two machines. This much was clear last year, when the 15-inch model was announced several months after the 13-inch, sporting the same M2 chip. This joint announcement puts the two models on the same refresh cycle, where they should be.Even more pronounced is the very narrow gulf between the base 15-inch Air and 14-inch Pro. The specs are near-identical across the board, save for stated 22 hours of battery to the Air models’ 18 hours (you have more room to navigate with a thicker, heavier machine). The Pro also sports a Liquid Retina XDR display, which packs 3024 x 1964 pixels into less screen real estate than the Air’s 2880 x 1864.It’s hard to recommend the base Pro over the Air. The math changes if you feel the need to upgrade to the M3 Pro, however. At that point you’ll also want to factor in the fact that (somewhat ironically) the Airs are fanless, meaning there’s going to be a thermal bottleneck when you really start pushing the machine. That said, Apple loves to point out how difficult it is to trigger the fan during daily use, meaning most Air users won’t be bothered by its absence most of the time.Image Credits: Brian HeaterWhen it arrived last year, we declared the 13-inch the best MacBook for most. Since then, it only saw a true challenger in the form of the 15-inch model, which has since become my daily driver. The Air inherited the throne of true mainstream devices from the standard MacBook, and as they've flourished, Pro models have increasingly shifted to the margin. The only major change here is the upgraded chip, making the 2024 model little more than a refresh.In the world of consumer electronics, that's to be expected. Apple created the best-ever MacBook with the 2023 Air. It was a perfect storm of powerful silicon, great industrial design and lessons learned from recent hardware stumbles. Given all that, it's ultimately for the best that the company stuck to the formula here. As for the whole “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI"" bit -- that's pure marketing. Intel made the same claim at the end of last year with its new Meteor Lake chips.As far as generative AI's current consumer reach, most modern laptops and phones are -- at very least -- serviceable. For now, the conversation largely centers on future-proofing systems for the great leaps to come. It's certainly something top of mind for Apple, as the company looks to make its first major announcements on the subject later this year (June's WWDC seems as good a time as any).Great strides have been made in bringing generative AI to consumers. The day-to-day usefulness of such platforms is another question entirely, but getting the most out of them will require capable machines, and the new Airs fit the bill. There's novelty in the ability to run large language models (LLMs) locally, though most consumers will continue to rely on cloud-based processing when they use these models.Programmers who really want to dive in will likely be eyeing Pro models and other high-end machines. For most consumers, however, the Air continues to be the best MacBook -- and it's not even close.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-macbook-air-m3-review/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-m3-macbook-air-review-140029672.html
2024-03-07 18:57:06+00:00,"UPDATE 2-EU's Breton warns gatekeepers against silencing developers in Apple, Epic Games spat","(Recasts with EU industry chief Breton's comments)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Thursday warned large online platforms against threatening developers, saying he would look into Apple's move to prevent Fortnite video-game maker Epic Games from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe as a matter of priority.The iPhone maker on Wednesday terminated a new developer account created by Epic in Sweden in an attempt to put Fortnite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. It cited Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.Epic Games had sought to take advantage of landmark EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which kick in on Thursday and require Apple to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.Breton criticised Apple's decision.""Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority,"" he said on X social media platform.The European Commission had earlier on Thursday said it had asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA.The EU executive will also evaluate whether Apple's actions comply with the DSA (Digital Services Act) and the P2B (Platform to Business Regulation), ""given the links between the developer programme membership and the App store as designated VLOP (very large online platform)"".Under the DSA, decisions suspending or terminating accounts have to be proportionate and with due regard to fundamental rights while the P2B requires a platform to notify a business user when terms and conditions are changed and before an account is closed.Apple reiterated its rights on Thursday.""Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion',"" an Apple spokesperson said.""In light of Epic's past and ongoing behaviour, Apple chose to exercise that right.""Epic on Wednesday said Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

2024-03-07 18:08:27+00:00,European regulators want to question Apple after it blocks Epic Games app store,"LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said they want to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store, in a possible violation of digital rules that took effect in the 27-nation bloc Thursday.It's a fresh escalation of the high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent years fighting Apple’s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps.Epic asserted Wednesday that Apple thwarted its attempt to set up its own iOS app marketplace to compete with Apple's App Store, calling it a breach of the EU's new Digital Markets Act.The sweeping set of rules, designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant — a move it's long resisted.The European Commission, the EU's top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement Thursday that it has “requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.” The rules threaten penalties that could reach into the billions for violations.Apple has already been hit this week with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting music streaming competition.The commission said it's “also evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU regulations including the Digital Services Act, a second set of regulations in the bloc's digital rulebook that prohibit tech companies from ”arbitrary application"" of their terms and conditions.Epic contended that Apple was brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store that it planned to set up in Sweden to serve European Union users.It accused Apple of retaliating for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.Apple said its action was justified because of Epic's previous unlawful actions and litigation that resulted in the U.S. court decision in 2021.Apple ousted Epic from its App Store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users, while also helping recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world’s most ubiquitous devices.“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,'"" Apple said in a statement. ""In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/european-regulators-want-apple-blocks-112006135.html
2024-03-07 18:04:04+00:00,Apple is making big App Store changes in Europe over new rules. Could it mean more iPhone hacking?,"Apple is opening small cracks in the iPhone's digital fortress as part of a regulatory clampdown in Europe that is striving to give consumers more choices — at the risk of creating new avenues for hackers to steal personal and financial information stored on the devices.The overhaul rolling out Thursday only in the European Union represents the biggest changes to the iPhone's App Store since Apple introduced the concept in 2008. Among other things, people in Europe can download iPhone apps from stores not operated by Apple and are getting alternative ways to pay for in-app transactions.European regulators are hoping the changes mandated by the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, will loosen the control that Big Tech's “digital gatekeepers” have gained over the products and services that consumers and businesses use as they become more dominant forces in everyday life.The measures took effect just days after EU regulators fined Apple nearly $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for thwarting competition in the music streaming market.Apple has lashed out at the new regulations for unnecessary security risks to iPhone users in Europe, exposing them to more scams and other malicious attacks launched from apps downloaded from outside its ecosystems and raising the specter of more unsavory services peddling pornography, illegal drugs and other content that the company has long prohibited in its App Store.Despite trying to maintain security safeguards while also adhering to the new rules in the 27-nation bloc, Apple is warning that “the changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap between the protections that Apple users outside of the EU can rely on and the protections available to users in the EU moving forward.”Apple’s warnings should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say.Managing mobile devices is “totally different” from third-party app stores, and Apple is “deliberately confusing it here to muddy the waters,” said Michael Veale, an associate professor at University College London who specializes in digital rights and regulation.“Apple’s App Store is not a proxy for corporate data security — apps within it regularly send data to insecure cloud servers, to hidden third-party trackers and much more,” he said.Some smaller tech companies like music streaming service Spotify and video game maker Epic Games also are attacking the ways Apple is complying with the DMA as little more than a facade that's making a “mockery” of the regulations' intent.“Rather than creating healthy competition and new choices, Apple’s new terms will erect new barriers and reinforce Apple’s stronghold over the iPhone ecosystem,"" Spotify, Epic and more than two dozen other companies and alliances wrote in a March 1 letter to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm overseeing the DMA.Epic, which makes the popular game Fortnite, also contends Apple is already brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store it planned to release in Sweden. Epic asserted Apple thwarted its attempt to compete as retaliation for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.In response, EU regulators said Thursday that they want to question Apple over allegations it blocked Epic's app store. Apple was defiant, saying it “chose to exercise that right” to boot the app store based on Epic's past behavior.Europe's shifting digital landscape is forcing changes at other technology powerhouses such as Google and Facebook, but the new regulations strike at the core of Apple's philosophy of maintaining ironclad control over every aspect of its products.This “walled garden” approach conceived by late co-founder Steve Jobs begins with the meticulous design of the hardware and then extends into all the software powering it devices, as well as overseeing the commerce occurring on them.The approach built an empire with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue — success that Apple traces to the trust it has built through decades of vigilant management of the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.Even Epic's Sweeney acknowledged that one of the reasons he uses an iPhone is because of the staunch security measures that Apple has deployed to thwart hackers and protect the privacy of its customers. That came during testimony in a May 2021 trial resulting in a U.S. judge ruling that the App Store isn't a monopoly.In that decision, the judge required Apple to begin allowing links to outside payment options inside iPhone apps in the U.S. It's a requirement that the company began to allow earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on that issue.Apple — which is making changes in Europe through an iPhone software update — still doesn't permit alternative iPhone app stores in the U.S. or more than 100 other countries outside the EU.European regulators appear convinced that the benefits consumers stand to reap from more competition will outweigh any increased security risks.One potential positive is lower prices for digital transactions within apps if competing stores charge lower commissions than the 15% to 30% fees Apple has been imposing for years.But critics are raising doubts that will happen because Apple still plans to charge fees after app downloads reach relatively low thresholds and have set up other hurdles that will make it daunting for alternative options to make significant inroads in Europe.Apple insists the security problems hatched by the DMA are so worrisome that it has been hearing from government agencies — especially those in defense, banking and emergency services — wanting to ensure they will be able to block employees with iPhones from accessing apps distributed from outside Apple's walled garden.“These agencies have all recognized that sideloading — downloading apps from outside the App Store — could compromise security and put government data and devices at risk,” Apple said.Veale, the digital expert, pushed back.“Any firm or government who believe ‘apps from the App Store are safe’ may need to refresh their security and data protection teams or policies,” he said.___AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed from London.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-making-big-app-store-095017332.html
2024-03-07 18:00:14+00:00,Stocks to Avoid: 3 Companies You Have No Business Buying Today,"Overall, it’s certainly great for investors that we’ve entered the phase of the bull market in which nearly everyone is becoming much more upbeat about stocks. After all, it’s obviously much easier to make money now in the market than it was last year and many times easier than was the case in 2022.At the same time, however, it’s also becoming much easier to get enticed into buying stocks with poor fundamentals that are nevertheless rallying due to investors increased optimism. Of course, those who buy such equities often lose a great deal of money on them in the longer run, since selling names that you once passionately believed in is not always easy to do.Here are three stocks to avoid in order to prevent yourself from falling into that trap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisualsGameStop (NYSE:GME) rallied about 18% between Feb. 22 and the afternoon of March 6. However, there’s no evidence that the firm’s fundamental problems are easing.Specifically, the retailer’s main business of selling hard copies of video games is slowly disappearing since most such games are being downloaded now. And while the company is also generating significant revenue by selling collectibles such as figures and coins, the latter business is commoditized and consequently not very profitable.Some may be enticed by the board’s decision to allow the firm to buy the stocks of other firms. But given the decisions by CEO Ryan Cohen to invest in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, which subsequently went bankrupt, and his purchase of GME stock itself, I would not expect big returns from the firm’s stock-purchasing programs.Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a Feb. 9 column,  “Sinking U.S. fertility rates are likely to undermine the businesses of companies whose products are primarily used by children.” After reporting that from 2007 to 2022, the birth rate tumbled nearly 23%.” I identified toy maker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) as one of the firms that was being undermined by the latter trend. Hasbro’s fourth-quarter results, reported on Feb. 13, show that its struggles continued late last year. Indeed, its top line tumbled 23% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.29 billion. Moreover, its net loss ballooned to $1.06 billion last quarter from $129 million in Q4 of 2023.Additionally, since many of today’s millennial parents are probably much more likely to be concerned about the impact of exposing their children to violent toys, chances are high that they are less likely to encourage their children to play with war-oriented toys than preceding generations of parents. The latter trend, in turn, is negative for HAS, which markets  G.I. Joe and Star Wars toys.Finally, toys have generally been getting much cheaper in recent years, probably due to increases in the amount of toys imported from developing countries. The latter trend, of course, is also negative for Hasbro and HAS stock.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) has historically obtained almost 80% of its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter tech giant incorporates Cirrus’ “audio chips and IC controllers” into most of its hardware.And the demand for Apple’s iPhones in China, its second-largest market, has reportedly been sinking. Indeed, iPhone unit sales in the Asian country reportedly tumbled “24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.”Also noteworthy is that, although Apple’s revenue from its iPhone sales rose 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, the figure was slightly below the peak reached in the final calendar quarter of 2021.Of course, a sharp decline of iPhone sales in China would very bad news for Cirrus, which obtains a small amount of revenue for each iPhone handed over to consumers.Despite these issues, CRUS stock has advanced nearly 20% since early February.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07 17:37:22+00:00,EU regulators take an interest in Apple-Epic Games dispute,"European Union (EU) regulators seek to question Apple (AAPL) over the tech giant's termination of the Epic Games Store from its App Store. European officials view this to be in violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest in the legal conflict between the Fortnite creator and Apple.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Apple is facing more regulatory scrutiny. EU regulators are set to question Apple on its recent feud with Epic Games and its App Store rules. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley to give us the details. So Dan, walk us through where we are now and how we got here.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So we'll start from how we got here. This basically all comes back to Epic Games and Apple's showdown where Epic wanted to provide consumers with a third party means of purchasing items inside of games. Apple doesn't allow that through the App Store. When Epic went ahead and did that on their own, Apple basically pulled Fortnite and suspended Epic Games from being able to use the App Store.Epic, knowing that this would happen, sued Apple. And then basically in California, what ended up happening was Apple was not found to be a monopolist, but it did have what the court said were some anti-steering rules. And so they had to address those.Now, where this recent spat comes from is the EU and the Digital Markets Act. And Apple basically says that look, we can't trust Epic. We need to put in place a kind of a block from them. We're not going to let them use our platforms because of the prior issues we've had with them. And Epic saying, look, the Digital Markets Act, which allows for third party app stores on things like iOS is in place, and we should be allowed to put our App Store there.So what we're hearing from the two companies is basically obviously completely opposite. So first, we have a statement from Epic where they say, ""Apple is taking one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store,"" which would be that Epic Games Store. ""They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.""Now, essentially what Epic is saying there is, look, CEO Tim Sweeney went ahead, criticized Apple and its Digital Markets Act maneuvers as well as its moves in the US. And they're saying that that's why Apple is not letting Epic run any App Store on iOS in the EU.Now, Apple on the flip side had this to say. Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate any or all of Epic Games', wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games control at any time. Apple chose to exercise that right.""That comes from that California court ruling. And so you know how that exactly plays out with the EU, I don't know. But it really comes down to two companies that are just at loggerheads over what they believe they should be allowed to do on iOS. And for Apple, they're not going to give this up, obviously. This is something that they're going to hold onto.They're trying to make moves that allow them to continue to remain in control of iOS and the App Store. And for Epic, look, they have a mountain of money from Fortnite, and so they're going to go ahead and continue to fight this as well. What it ends up doing is making Apple look bad and making Epic look bad so we'll see if either or decides to pull back or doesn't or if the EU makes some decision. Now, they're starting to probe Apple on its decision to pull Epic Games' ability to put games onto the App Store in the EU.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a legal battle when you consider the California ruling versus what the EU is looking at in terms of the disproportionate or proportionate reaction that Apple had. Are we expecting to see more of these sorts of these challenges when it comes to the App Store and Apple trying to maintain its dominance while still trying to stay within the rules here?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, when it comes to the $2 billion that they were fined from the EU over Apple Music and Spotify, Apple says that they're going to appeal that. And so clearly, they're not going to just take this lying down. They're going to continue to try to I guess work through what the EU's rules are but to the limit, right? And so that appears to be what they're intent on doing.They don't want to give up making money off of the App Store or the way they do now through commissions from developers when there's sales of their products or apps themselves. And so you got to imagine that they're going to continue to try to fight this as much as they can while still sticking to the law.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/eu-regulators-takes-interest-apple-173722879.html

2024-03-07 16:59:28+00:00,Welcome to the Digital Markets Act. Here’s what you need to know about the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law,"Europe’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) finally started hitting Big Tech with tough antitrust obligations today. And what better way to understand its impact than to look at how tech firms have moved to comply—and to take advantage of new opportunities?But first, here’s what happens if these so-called gatekeepers—which so far include Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok parent ByteDance—don’t comply. They can get hit with fines of up to 10% of global annual revenue. If they keep breaking the rules, those fines can rise to 20%, and the European Commission can even break businesses up or block them from buying other companies relating to whatever naughtiness is concerned.It’s worth noting that, in light of how weak enforcement by underfunded national regulators undermined the bite of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, which deals with privacy, the Commission has decided to enforce the DMA itself. The same goes for its sister law, the Digital Services Act, which mostly deals with content-moderation issues. It remains to be seen whether the Commission has the resources to do this effectively for either law, but that’s the plan.Got that? Cool. Let’s proceed with the changes themselves—and remember, these are Europe-only.Moving easily to rival services. Many companies have been letting users download their data for years now, but now they’re going beyond that. For example, Google and TikTok owner ByteDance have launched data portability APIs so users can give other developers permission to directly import their data from the gatekeepers’ services—handy for switching service providers, but also potentially for backing up their data.Freedom from default choices. Remember when Microsoft was once forced to tell Windows users that they had browser options beyond Internet Explorer, like Google’s Chrome? Now Chrome will tell its users that they have other search engine options. And Google will also give Android users a choice of browsers and search engines when they set up their device.More control over data privacy. Continuing the inexorable bleeding together of data-protection and competition law, people now get to decide if one of these Big Tech conglomerates can keep linking together the data from accounts users have with its various services—something that has big implications for user profiling and ad targeting. So Meta now lets people decouple Facebook and Instagram accounts, and Google does the same for YouTube, Search, and its many other services.Choice of in-app payment services. Google and Apple now let app developers deploy third-party payment mechanisms that aren’t Google Pay and Apple Pay. Google mostly did this in 2022 already, though it’s only now fully expanded the program to game developers. Apple left everything until the last minute. But hey, third-party developers can actually access the iPhone’s NFC tap-to-pay chip now!Interoperability of services. Gatekeepers don’t have to make their services interoperable with just anyone—nobody wants security to go out the window—but they do need to allow it in principle. So, for example, users of Meta’s WhatsApp will soon be able to talk to people on other messaging platforms. (Meta is trying to avoid the same obligation for its Messenger service.)Business data transparency. Business customers of these platforms can now demand easier access to the data they generate. This looks set to have a real impact in the advertising space, as both Google and Amazon are now promising to give advertisers and publishers more data.No more anti-steering. Well hello there, Apple. Days after the company was fined $2 billion for refusing to let Spotify and other streaming services inform their iOS users about cheaper off-platform subscription deals, the new rules demand more clearly that gatekeepers let business users “promote offers and conclude contracts with customers outside the gatekeeper’s platform.” So that’s definitely now a thing, although Google is trying the interesting tactic of claiming fat fees for these “external offers,” as it calls them. I imagine developers will complain to the Commission about that. But speaking of Apple …Third-party app stores. Google already allowed third-party app stores on Android, and as of now, Apple must do the same on iOS. The first third party, whose German developers have promised a launch as soon as the DMA comes into force (it isn’t live yet), is Mobivention, which focuses on the enterprise market. MacPaw’s Setapp should follow in April.However, Apple celebrated the advent of the DMA by denying archnemesis Epic Games’ attempt to launch a European iOS app store and bring Fortnite back to European iPhones. I don’t have space to explain why here—but you can find my comprehensive explainer here. Tl;dr: Apple’s DMA-compliance hissy fit over the past couple months has somehow become even more outrageous, and it’s unlikely to pay off for the company. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just released a video celebrating the advent of the DMA, and it pointedly referred to Fortnite returning to iOS. I checked with her staff, and she definitely recorded it after Apple’s latest tantrum.More news below.David MeyerWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/welcome-digital-markets-act-know-165928358.html

Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills is joined by Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to comment on the upside reeling from tech sell-offs.Healthcare, industrials, materials, those are doing well, despite some of the Mag 7 — three in particular, Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — down for the year,"" Woods states. That usually scares this market, it's not. So something's changed and it's a good narrative.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[BELL RINGING]- There it is. We did it again. That's the opening bell on Wall Street and at the NASDAQ in Midtown Manhattan where they've got some funfetti because it's a day that ends in Y, Pentair ringing the opening bell at the NYSE, ticker symbol PNT. And in Midtown Manhattan you've got we're going to go with Energem.- OK. I like that pronunciation.- You like that one?- Yeah.- OK. All right, we'll stick with that one for now. We'll workshop it a little bit here in the break. We've got team coverage of the biggest market movers following the opening bell on Wall Street standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. We've got Jay Woods alongside Madison Mills and Jared Blikre, who is here at the Wi-Fi interactive on standby,Madison, just 30 minutes before Fed Chair Jay Powell's second day of congressional testimony kicks off, what are you hearing around the exchange?- Well, Brad, I'm here with Jay Woods, who I'd love to get that quote of what you just said. What did you say when you just turned to the boards?- I said, we're ripping.- What's going on?- Hey, did I curse? If I did, I don't want to quote that. What's going on-- we're having a nice day here. Remember Monday and Tuesday when we sold off? This is the third time we've had close to a 2% selloff from the top of the S&P 500. We haven't had a 2% selloff in now, I believe, 90 days, where there have only been six streaks longer, which is quite impressive.And every time you think we're going to give a little bit back, the buyers step in and we're stepping in again despite Powell's testimony where we're going to be a little higher for longer. So this market's resilient and, yeah, it's pretty amazing to see.- So we had the selloff, and then we have this catalyst for growth. What is driving this growth that we're still seeing off of that selloff?- Well, we're seeing a rotation. We had a good earnings season. We got through that. We still have a few coming out later today, but 99% are done. So let's say we're done.And now, we're waiting for that next catalyst. What's that going to be? I think it's going to be the CPI next week, unemployment tomorrow. But right now, despite inflation still being a little sticky and higher for longer, the market is resilient, and the broadening out, we're seeing the Russell still continue to do well.Health care, industrials, materials, those are doing well, despite some of the Mag Seven, three of them in particular-- Tesla, Apple, and Google-- down for the year. Tesla down over 20%, Apple down over 10%. That usually scares this market. It's not, so something's changed, and it's a good narrative.- If you're an investor who has those three names that you mentioned and maybe even I would throw in a Microsoft-- they're kind of surviving, but I feel like they're not thriving the way the other top three in the seven are-- what's your advice to them? What should they be thinking about and framing their thinking on? Should they be panicking right now?- Well, if that's their only stock holding, yeah, I'd be a little nervous because you're missing out on the rest of the rally. But, I mean, Apple has proven time and time again that any pause, any stop in their uptrend is probably a good buying opportunity.Tesla a little different. Google, they have some AI concerns, but Google has always figured it out as well. So what it is just a rotation, and people are going to different asset classes, whether it's Bitcoin and gold-- which are making all-time highs. It's crazy-- or some of the other smaller stocks that have not participated yet in the rally.And then you have AI. It just doesn't slow down. NVIDIA over 900 this morning. Crazy.- When you look at AI plays, I was just talking about Micron Technology, what should investors be looking at in terms of the fundamentals, the balance sheet on these companies to suss out where they can afford to play AI if they can't get in on NVIDIA?- Yeah, well, I mean, you can buy the SMH, the Semiconductor Index, that's a best way to have a basket of stocks that are all AI related. NVIDIA definitely the best in class. Who's the next one up? We have Broadcom earnings after the close today. It's going to be interesting to see what they do.NVIDIA was up 260% coming into this week over 52 weeks. You know, Broadcom symbol AVGO was up 135%, so you do have stocks that are making tremendous runs in AI, but NVIDIA just outshines everybody. It's best in class, and it's best in class for a reason. They keep raising the bar.The AI story, as Dan Ives always says-- I know he's been on your network and talked to you guys in the studio-- it's still early innings, and I believe Dan Ives. And you just have to be selective. If you want to get in, buy a basket. It's the best way to play it.- All right. Buy that basket. Thank you so much, Jay. We really appreciate you. As always, Brad and Seana, I'll toss it back to you guys in the studio.- All right. Thanks so much, Maddy, and thanks, Jay, for telling us how to play the movement that we're seeing to the upside. Buy the basket.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/stocks-rip-higher-off-shifting-150753693.html

Those companies will now be forced to follow more stringent rules when it comes to their competitive practices.Just a few of the changes include Apple allowing users in the EU to download apps from third-party app stores, for the first time since Apple launched its own 15 years ago. Meanwhile, Google will be forced to drive more traffic to other shopping or travel-booking sites instead of directing users to its own platforms. And Meta might be forced to integrate messages from other messaging apps, like Signal or Viber, into its Messenger and WhatsApp services.The sweeping changes will affect six of the biggest names in tech: Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Bytedance - which owns TikTok.

2024-03-07 12:44:18+00:00,RIVN Stock Forecast: What Will It Take for Rivian to Turn Things Around?,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) and other early-stage EV companies posted disastrous Q4 earnings. Last week, RIVN stock made quite the waves in the startup EV industry (for the wrong reasons), plunging to its lowest levels in a year.The EV stock bubble peaked in Q4 2021, just when Rivian went public, with Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) market cap surging past $1.2 trillion. This year is seeing automaker giants thrive as EV startups struggle. Tesla’s operating margins have been slashed by half, and Rivian faces its own problem set.Can RIVN stock recover from what went wrong?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management floated that since the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Car project was canceled, Apple should consider buying Rivian Automotive. Given Apple’s standing as a tech business and its lack of top-line growth in recent quarters, Munster spotlighted its need for growth and its potential for expansion into key markets.On that note of Apple needing to expand, Munster said Apple could acquire Rivian. He pointed out DJ Novotney’s January switch from Apple to Rivian. Munster has long awaited for Apple’s market cap to reach $3 trillion.Munster was taken aback at Apple’s cancellation of the Apple Car project, which could have increased Apple’s revenue by $250 billion yearly. Rivian’s production estimate for 2023 is in line with its output, which raises eyebrows on its financial reserves until 2026.Munster changed the focus of his Apple future predictions to AI development. Investors shouldn’t place all of their faith in this for Rivian, though, since the market for EVs is still questionable.What comes after a poor Q4 performance and a stock nosedive? RIVN stock answers this with a plan to lay off 10% of its salaried staff, affecting about 150 Bay Area workers. Palo Alto’s job cuts will start on April 23.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe faced backlash for completely blindsiding staff. The reason? Announcing the layoffs through email. Rivian may be reporting a whopping $5.4 billion loss in 2023. And for 2024? $2.7 billion.The $70,000 R1T pickup and $75,000 R1S SUV added color to Rivian’s lineup. To cut expenses, it plans to close a factory in Illinois and change the engineering of vehicles. CEO Scaringe pledged to promote the use of EVs while being confident in the face of economic difficultiesElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, made it known that high-volume production with positive cash flow isn’t just resolved with a decent product design. Thus, Musk alerted Rivian that the company may declare bankruptcy in six months. Therefore, Rivian should lessen costs and have its executive team be in the factory to prevent failure.Rivian saw some early gains, but its stock seems to rebound slowly. Issues facing the EV sector might only go away once the macroeconomy stabilizes. For Rivian to succeed, it must increase production, cut losses, introduce new models, and set eyes for gross profit in 2024.To prevent more future losses, steer clear of RIVN’s current direction.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-07 12:37:23+00:00,"‘A serious violation’: Why Apple just killed off Epic’s EU app store, and why the Fortnite maker will probably prevail","To mark the moment the European Union’s new Big Tech antitrust law comes into force, Tim Cook’s Apple has decided to test its limits with an extraordinary escalation of its long-running feud with Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games.The Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduces many new obligations for so-called “gatekeeper” services that link businesses and consumers, and the iPhone operating system iOS and its App Store have both been classified as such.So, as of Thursday, Apple is obliged to allow third-party app stores on iPhones—a shift that will allow developers to distribute apps without having to give Apple a fat cut of transactions conducted within them.Epic was planning to become one of the first big players to launch an iOS app store, but on Wednesday the Fortnite maker revealed that Apple had blocked the move by terminating the developer account that Epic’s Swedish affiliate had set up to launch the store, and that provides Epic games on Apple's own App Store.“This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,” Epic wrote in a blog post. “In terminating Epic’s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.”The revelation quickly drew a response from the European Commission, which will be directly enforcing the DMA, and which said it had asked Apple for “further explanations” under the new law.To understand what just happened, one needs to rewind to the start of the decade when Epic and Apple began their feud over the issue of in-app payments, which have traditionally earned Apple a 30% cut on the iOS platform.Epic, which had long protested this cut, deliberately made changes in the iOS version of Fortnite in August 2020 so that in-app purchases could bypass Apple’s payment system in favor of Epic’s own.This broke Apple’s policy, but Epic claimed it was doing so to pass on savings to its users.Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store. Epic sued. Apple countersued and (mostly) won that fight, with a Californian court ruling in September 2021 that Apple has the right to terminate any Epic-affiliated developer account at its “sole discretion.”Epic had to pay Apple $3.65 million in breach-of-contract damages. (Apple also recently launched an attempt to claim over $73 million in legal fees stemming from the case, which Epic is furiously resisting.)Fast-forward to late January of this year.With the DMA’s debut little more than a month away, Apple announced it would allow third-party iOS app stores, but that any developer distributing an app through the new channels would have to pay a new €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” for every first installation of that app, whether that installation takes place via the third-party store or Apple’s own App Store.Downloads of the alternative app stores themselves would also trigger the fee, to be paid by the developers of the app stores.Apple’s move earned an apoplectic reaction from many companies that were planning to launch their own iOS app stores—Meta and Microsoft are heavily lobbying Brussels to decide it is not compliant with the DMA—but Epic CEO Sweeney was the first to voice loud criticism.“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under [the] DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads,” Sweeney wrote on X on Jan. 25.Despite its protests about Apple’s “malicious compliance” with the DMA, Epic said it would take up Apple’s terms and launch an iOS app store in Europe.However, on Feb. 23, Apple executive Phil Schiller wrote to Sweeney—Epic yesterday published the email exchange—to point out that Epic had previously “entered into agreements with Apple and then broken them.”Schiller highlighted Sweeney’s “colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan” and said it “strongly” suggested Epic was going to again break its developer contract with Apple.Schiller asked Sweeney for “written assurance that you are also acting in good faith, and that Epic Games Sweden will, despite your public actions and rhetoric, honor all of its commitments.”Sweeney quickly responded: “Epic and its subsidiaries are acting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple, and we’ll be glad to provide Apple with any specific further assurances on the topic that you’d like.”Three days later, Sweeney again took to X to accuse Apple of “contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies,” adding that his rival was “a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers, and overlord to none.”In a Mar. 2 legal letter that Epic published yesterday, Apple referenced this post as partial justification for its decision to cancel the developer account of Epic Games Sweden, which was to operate the mobile Epic Games Store and Fortnite in Europe.In the letter, Apple’s lawyers said Sweeney’s “litany of public attacks on Apple’s policies, compliance plan, and business model” had “undercut” his “minimal assurances” to Schiller. Citing the 2021 Californian ruling that gave Apple the right to unilaterally cancel any Epic developer agreements, they announced Apple was doing just that.“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,” Apple said in a statement.In its post yesterday, Epic said Apple was “undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.”Apple will probably have a tough time convincing the Commission that an American court ruling gives it the right to undermine a key plank of the DMA just as the new law comes into force.For a start, Apple’s whole approach to DMA compliance—the very thing Sweeney was loudly protesting—has been downright petulant.When it announced the changes it was making to comply, Apple did so while complaining they “bring greater risks to users and developers.”Then, in February, Apple used another new demand of the DMA—that it allows the developers of third-party browsers such as Chrome to avoid using Apple’s WebKit browser engine—as an excuse to kill off home-screen web apps on iOS, again in the name of security.This would have removed another avenue for developers who want to avoid Apple’s in-app payments cut, and the Commission swiftly threatened an investigation, forcing Apple to reverse its plan.Then, wrapping up a pre-DMA case in which Spotify was the complainant, the Commission on Monday hit Apple with a $2 billion fine for stopping streaming-app developers from telling their iOS users that they can get cheaper subscriptions outside Apple’s platform—which is possible because, yet again, it’s a way to avoid Apple taking a huge cut of the subscription fee.Apple has to drop these “anti-steering” tactics anyway under the DMA and, as it announced its appeal, it accused the Commission of trying to “enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law.” It also accused Spotify and the Commission of “coordinating” in the case.So Apple and the Commission were already at war before this latest Epic episode.Reacting to Epic’s revelation, the Commission didn’t just say it was looking into the matter under the DMA—it also said it was “evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with two other laws, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Platform-to-Business (P2B) Regulation.The still-quite-new DSA is a sister law to the DMA, covering platforms’ content rather than their competitive practices—it’s the law under which the Commission recently started investigating X (regarding disinformation) and TikTok (regarding child protection and ad transparency.)In this case, the Commission wants to know whether Apple shutting down Epic Games Sweden’s developer account was a violation.“The DSA sets a requirement for clear, transparent terms and conditions, no arbitrary application of these terms and conditions, provision of statements of reasons in case a decision is taken, and the possibility for complaints and redress,” a Commission spokesperson said in an email. “If content is moderated and accounts are temporarily suspended or permanently terminated, this needs to be proportionate and in due regard to fundamental rights.”As for the P2B Regulation, the issue is that a platform has to “notify a business user…before an account is terminated,” the spokesperson said. It’s not hard to see how Apple may have failed this test when its lawyers sent Epic that letter telling it that its Swedish developer account had been terminated “effective immediately.”But perhaps the biggest problem with Apple’s justification for nixing Epic’s app store is the fact that Sweeney’s criticism of Apple’s rules is something that the Commission effectively solicited.It has been clear throughout the last few months that the changes companies make to comply with the DMA will be evaluated while taking account of “market feedback”—it wants affected companies to say their piece, and now Apple is punishing Epic for doing just that.The Commission still hasn’t said what it thinks of Apple’s new “core technology fee,” but it was never going to do that before Thursday anyway. With the way Apple has conducted itself in recent weeks, it’s hard to see how the company isn’t cruising for a bruising.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/serious-violation-why-apple-just-123723171.html

2024-03-07 12:00:00+00:00,Apple highlights iPhone 15 Pro in live-action manga film,"Apple has extended its long-running “Shot on iPhone” campaign with a live-action adaptation of manga series “Midnight,” according to details shared with Marketing Dive. The film first debuted in Tokyo.The 19-minute suspense drama tells the story of a taxi driver who is pulled out of his way to assist a truck driver on the run from a hitman. The film, shot in the dark streets of Tokyo, showcases the capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.The full film, available on YouTube, is being released on Abema TV and Apple TV on March 7 and will be played in select Tokyo taxis from 10 p.m. until morning. The effort will also be supported by broadcast, magazine, out-of-home (OOH), digital OOH, digital and social.Apple’s ongoing “Shot on iPhone” campaign has captured moments from a variety of touchpoints over the years, whether it be the work of student filmmakers or a music video for pop star Olivia Rodrigo, in an attempt to showcase the creative capabilities of the iPhone. For its latest effort, the tech giant is tapping into pop-culture hype surrounding manga, a move that could help it engage with consumers while highlighting what the iPhone 15 Pro has to offer.Apple’s “Midnight” is a live-action adaptation of the popular 1986 manga series written by Osamu Tezuka. The 19-minute film, shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro, tells the story of a taxi driver and the strange passengers he meets while making late-night rounds before encountering truck driver Kaede, who is on the run from a hitman. The adaptation, which blends original manga strips created by Tezuka, was written by Yusuke Watanabe, a TV, anime and film screenwriter, and directed by Takashi Miike (“Audition”).The “Midnight” film was shot in a way that could highlight the low-light and cinematic capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro. Notably, the film combines live-action shots with CGI while utilizing the phone’s LiDAR scanner in post production to create the 3D model base for the taxi and its staple fifth wheel. The film is also meant to showcase the iPhone 15 Pro’s attention to detail and its stabilization capabilities, as seen during the live-action fighting shots, per release information. The effort was handled by TBWA\Media Arts Lab Tokyo.The latest cultural play by Apple is a likely attempt to boost sales momentum of the iPhone, which CEO Tim Cook credited for the company’s strong results in its latest quarter, though the iPhone 15 in some areas has recently seen weak demand. The tech giant reported revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 that ended Dec. 30, per its most recent earnings statement.The “Midnight” film was shared to YouTube on March 6 and will premiere on Apple TV and Japanese streaming service Abema TV on March 7. Additionally, the original manga magazine will feature characters from the film on the cover of its March issue. A number of additional channels will support the effort, including with the film and behind-the-scenes content being played in select taxis across Tokyo during the evening hours, which could help Apple capture the attention of consumers who aren’t directly seeking it out.Along with Apple, a handful of others have similarly tapped into hype around anime and manga in hopes of striking a stronger consumer connection. In February, McDonald’s launched a campaign and “WcDonald’s” push inspired by how the brand is often depicted in anime and manga that included a new sauce, packaging and episodic content. In another example, Ikea last year launched a TikTok campaign aimed at Gen Z consumers that turned college moments into anime art.This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

2024-03-07 11:43:00+00:00,Microsoft’s AI Gold Rush: Boom or Bubble Waiting to Burst?,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s most valuable company. It’s a fact that I’m sure MSFT stock investors love.But does it deserve to be?Compare it to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which it passed in market cap recently, and you can see it’s a momentum play. Apple had sales of $383 billion last year. Microsoft’s were $211 billion. Apple reported $96 billion of that revenue as net income. MSFT stock reported $72 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat makes the difference is that Apple revenues were higher in 2022 than 2023. Microsoft’s grew about 8%. Microsoft should continue that growth this year. Apple’s revenues are now expected to decline.MSFT stock is in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) sweet spot. It controls OpenAI, and its Co-Pilot is already drawing enormous revenue. AI is driving today’s stock market.That should mean 14% growth according to analysts. We’re talking about $257 billion in fiscal 2025 revenue (Microsoft’s fiscal year starts in July), against $225 billion expected for 2024. Profit growth is also expected to be 14%.If you’re buying Microsoft stock today, you consider those estimates low. Microsoft’s Azure cloud is taking market share from Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN). Microsoft has successfully tied Generative AI to its software suite. This is in contrast to the situation at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), where search and AI are competing for resources.MSFT stock has also, so far, dodged some of the antitrust problems that now bedevil Google. Thank its own antitrust history, where it lost over a decade of progress to consent decrees. The Cloud Czar built by CEO Satya Nadella is a complete reinvention of the company, a process Microsoft’s rivals have barely begun. Remember, the company built by Bill Gates was based on software packed in boxes and installed by users.Life isn’t all gravy at Microsoft these days.Getting the cost balance right between cloud and programming is a challenge.This is illustrated by what’s happening now in my hometown of Atlanta. Microsoft just bought land to expand its data center southwest of the city. At the same time, it has stalled the development of a planned office complex near downtown and the city wants its land back. The blowback may include higher taxes.Microsoft put $22.7 billion into capital spending during the first two quarters of this year. It’s on pace to blow away last year’s record capital spending of $31.9 billion.That’s why Microsoft laid off 1,900 gaming employees recently. It laid off over 10,000 people last year. It’s raising prices wherever it can.For every two programmers it lets go, Microsoft may only be able to afford one GenAI programmer. The average programmer in the U.S. today is earning about $29 per hour, or $60,000 per year. If they’re working on Generative AI, the pay can be twice that.Even the Kings of AI face hard choices, between investing in people and investing in things.Microsoft is doing big business in AI tools and cloud capacity. Not all of it is being done in cash. Much of the money it has put into OpenAI and, more recently, into Mistral, is in the form of Azure credits. These decisions limit the benefits Microsoft will get from GenAI applications, even while they raise the hackles of antitrust authorities.Those concerns are serious. Microsoft’s attempt to sidestep European regulators, separating its Teams and Office suites, failed to satisfy them. Europe is looking into its security software and even the OpenAI deal.That doesn’t mean you should sell your Microsoft stock. But the current Price to Earnings (PE) multiple of over 36, and a yield of under .75%, means it’s fully valued. You’re bumping against a ceiling, and that ceiling isn’t rising fast enough to keep future downdrafts away.I’d wait for those downdrafts before buying more.As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, and AMZN.

2024-03-07 11:15:00+00:00,3 Bargain Buffett Stocks to Buy Before They Rebound,"Warren Buffett is widely considered to be the greatest investor of all time. The man has amassed an incredible Fortune from the stock market. Yet he is not infallible, nor does every trade that he makes win. Indeed, if you know where to look there are several bargain Buffett stocks to buy.A look at his current portfolio indicates as much. There are multiple positions which, if sold today, would result in substantial losses. Given that Warren Buffett himself has purchased these stocks at higher prices there is reason to believe that they hold substantial rebound potential.Beyond that, market dynamics could very easily shift in favor of all of the stocks below. Remember, Warren Buffett broadly invests in the strength of the U.S. economy as a guiding force. There are multiple reasons to believe that the economy could improve from here which would propel those shares higher. Bearing all of that in mind, let’s take a look at these bargain Buffett stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is getting hammered as I write this. In fact, the stock is experiencing its worst day in its history.The company is dealing with difficulties on multiple fronts and the markets are responding in kind. that resulted in shares dropping by 19% on the day. One reason for the terrible performance is that CEO Frank Slootman announced he will retire. He will be replaced by a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) ad chief Sridhar Ramaswamy.Additionally, sales guidance from the company was slightly below what analysts had been expecting. Operating margin guidance of 3% was well below the 7.2% analysts have been expecting. Broadly speaking, the news was negatively received yet some pundits perceive the news as a net positive. Macquarie Equity Research upgraded its target price from $182 to $205.The average buying price of a Warren Buffett is just above $238. This looks like a good entry point from a contrarian perspective. Remember, snowflake is a growth stock at heart and once rate cuts are enacted it should jump higher again. Revenues grew by 33% during Q4.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most important of all Warren Buffett stocks. It represents 47.5% of his overall holdings. It’s also down over the last few weeks having fallen from $195 to $181 at present. That makes it a potential rebound stock and generally speaking, investing in Apple when it falls is a good idea.It’s no secret that many of the other leading Silicon Valley firms have better invested in artificial intelligence than Apple. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google all fit within that category.The result is that shares are trading at levels last seen in early November. Apple also announced that it is winding down the apple car project, long expected to boost the firm. I personally think it’s a good decision but that’s not particularly important.What is important is that Apple is currently expected to make major AI announcements in June. The money from the shuttered Apple Car Projects can now be directed into AI. That’s a big bonus. I think it’s a great time to be investing in AAPL.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett recently increased his stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) by 1.8%. That should be a good enough reason for investors to consider it as well. Buffet has been investing in the oil company for the last few years.Generally speaking, anytime Buffett invests in an oil company it’s a reasonable signal that he believes the price of crude oil will rise. Yet, that isn’t the only reason Buffett likes Occidental Petroleum.The company generates the majority of its revenues from drilling operations. It also operates chemical plants and refineries. In short, its integrated structure allows it to benefit more substantially when the spot price of oil rises.Beyond that, there are a few reasons that the general investor should also consider Occidental Petroleum. Shares currently trade for $60, which is the low target price assigned to its shares by analysts. The consensus view is that shares should move nearer to $68. In addition, Occidental Petroleum includes a dividend which will increase any returns by an additional 88 cents.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07 11:05:00+00:00,EU Slaps Apple with $2B Fine: Strategic Setback or Minor Speed Bump?,"On Monday, Brussels fined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for hindering competition among music streaming rivals through App Store restrictions. The penalty included a basic fine of 40 million euros and a substantial lump sum as a deterrent, marking the EU’s first action and dinging AAPL stock.The European Commission accused Apple in response to a 2019 complaint by Spotify, alleging it prevented the streaming service and others from informing users of alternative payment options outside the App Store.On Monday, Apple faced EU penalties for unfair trading conditions, mirroring a Dutch antitrust ruling. Apple plans to appeal the decision. Currently, AAPL stock is trading substantially lower, with some calling for even more downside on the horizon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith this sort of backdrop, let’s dive into whether Apple is a mega-cap stock worth buying at current levels.The EU competition authority fined Apple nearly $2B for monopolizing music app distribution, leading to a drop in AAPL stock. Following a probe triggered by Spotify, the European Commission penalized Apple €1.8B for breaching antitrust rules with its App Store policies, prohibiting app developers from promoting cheaper alternatives outside the platform.Apple plans to appeal, stating the decision lacks evidence of consumer harm and disregards the competitive market landscape.In Monday trading, AAPL fell over 2% to $174.98. The company also acknowledged how Spotify is the main beneficiary of the released ruling, putting emphasis on its 56% shares in Europe’s music streaming platforms.Spotify reciprocated, stating Apple’s restrictions benefited its own service, Apple Music. Despite the drop, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani maintained a buy rating on Apple stock, adjusting it off his “tactical outperform” list, with a price target of $220.At a press conference, European Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager highlighted that millions of European music streaming users lacked access to all options because of Apple’s anti-steering rules. Spotify welcomed the EU decision but noted broader concerns about Apple’s conduct toward developers in other markets.Analyst Ryan Reith from IDC noted that while the fine wouldn’t immediately impact Apple’s finances, it signals a broader trend of dismantling Apple’s ecosystem barriers. Over the past decade, the EU has fined Google billions, and Vestager’s directive to Apple aligns with the upcoming Digital Markets Act.In other Apple news, the giant tech unveiled its most recent MacBook Air model, powered by its latest M3 chip. This laptop prides itself with its boosted performance, which is 60% faster than previous models.With improved Neural Engine capabilities, it remains a top choice for AI tasks. Like older models, the M3 chip Macbook Airs are available in 13- and 15-inch sizes. One of its best features is 18 hours of battery life, a sleeker design, and an impressive Liquid Retina display.On top of that, the laptop also boasts dual external displays, and buyers can choose from four colors. Not only that, the computer also accommodates MagSafe charging and the news macOS.Orders started today, March 4, with availability on March 8.Greg Joswiak from Apple praised the upgraded MacBook Air with the M3 chip, highlighting its remarkable speed and extended battery life. Now that it runs on the latest M3 chip, the laptop guarantees 60% faster speed, which makes it far better for gaming or work. Individuals will also love the sleek design it offers which is thinner and lighter than most laptops we have in the market today.The issue with the EU case is just one of the littlest challenges Apple has to face. Its augmented reality ventures in the workplace may expedite Apple’s reputation, with Vision Pro headsets already selling 200,000 units at $3,499 each. While this boosts sales and lowers production costs, it raises concerns about cannibalizing other Apple products, notably tablets.Apple faces a pivotal moment as it gauges Vision Pro’s sustained success and AR’s long-term viability, offering investors a chance to enter the burgeoning AR market.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-07 11:00:38+00:00,"Big changes for Apple, Google and other tech giants: Europe’s sweeping law goes into effect today","Europeans using Apple, Google and other major tech platforms woke to a new reality Thursday as a landmark law imposed tough new competition rules on the companies — changing European Union citizens’ experience with phones, apps, browsers and more.The new EU regulations force sweeping changes on some of the world’s most widely used tech products, including Apple’s app store, Google search and messaging platforms, including Meta’s WhatsApp. And they mark a turning point in a global effort by regulators to bring tech giants to heel after years of allegations that the companies harmed competition and left consumers worse off.The broad obligations apply only to the EU, which could leave tech users in the United States and other markets looking longingly at some of the features Big Tech is rolling out in response to the European directive.In one seismic shift to comply with the law, Apple said it plans to let EU users download iPhone apps via third-party app stores — easing its grip on iOS for the first time since the App Store’s debut 15 years ago.In another significant change, Google said it will alter search results to drive more traffic to independent comparison-shopping or travel-booking sites, instead of directing users toward Google Flights or other tools it owns. Google will also allow Android users to select a preferred browser and search engine from a menu of options when first setting up their devices, rather than defaulting users to Google’s Chrome browser and search engine. That could give a leg up to rival browsers such as Opera or Mozilla’s Firefox and competing search engines including DuckDuckGo or Microsoft’s Bing.Users of messaging apps such as Signal or Viber, meanwhile, could soon be able to send chat messages directly to people who use Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp platforms, under a new openness requirement imposed on the social media giant.And streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix could potentially market discounts within their apps to those that buy subscriptions through the services’ respective websites rather than through proprietary in-app payment systems once forced on app developers by the app stores.The industry-wide changes are linked to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a 2022 law requiring dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. Its broad obligations affect six of the world’s largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.By mid-May, that list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the European Commission said this week.Violations of the DMA can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.For years, policymakers around the world have accused tech giants of monopolizing digital markets and using consumers’ personal data to entrench their power or to identify new markets to dominate. The tech giants, for their part, have insisted they compete vigorously, have created valuable opportunities for entrepreneurs and unlocked billions of dollars in economic activity.Europe’s broad new rules highlight skepticism of that defense and showcase how the EU has led the charge on tech regulation globally, sometimes with ripple effects for the rest of the world.The trading bloc has approved other comprehensive legislation in recent years regulating digital privacy, social media and, soon, artificial intelligence. Some of its regulations have had broader impacts: In 2022, a new EU law forcing Apple to use USB-C as the charging standard for mobile devices prompted Apple to adopt the standard for all its new iPhones, including in the United States.Europe’s new competition law does not directly target the six named companies. Rather, it says that companies meeting a specific size threshold must abide by certain “gatekeeper” rules to prevent them from abusing their enormous economic power.One way the EU plans to regulate that power is by giving consumers more control over how tech giants use their personal information. Under the DMA, EU citizens will be able to opt out of having their usage history from one app shared with other apps owned by the same company. For example, Google users will be able to prevent their search and browsing histories from being shared with Google’s YouTube video platform, which could affect what videos YouTube suggests to users. Amazon, meanwhile, will need consumers’ consent before using their Prime Video, Kindle or Audible usage history to create targeted recommendations or advertisements on its e-commerce marketplace.Europe’s first-of-its-kind digital competition law draws contrasts to the United States, where proposals to regulate the tech industry have repeatedly floundered. Some of the ideas in the DMA have been replicated in US legislation but have failed to pass amid industry opposition and ordinary congressional gridlock.While the law could increase demand for tech companies to extend EU-specific features to other markets, few platforms have shown signs they plan to do so. For example, Apple’s app store plans for Europe diverge significantly from changes to its US-based app store that it was forced to make as part of an antitrust lawsuit involving “Fortnite”-maker Epic Games. Apple has not given any indication it will harmonize the two sets of policies.Consumer groups say the DMA promises to lower prices for Europeans by forcing platforms open and requiring them to compete on a more level playing field.“We have worked really hard at the EU level to get this law adopted to improve digital markets in benefit of consumers,” said Agustin Reyna, legal director at BEUC, a coalition of EU-based consumer advocacy organizations.But some tech companies have pushed back on the DMA, warning that it could lead to unintended consequences.Google, for example, argued this week that its changes to search results in response to the DMA could drive more searches to aggregators of travel or restaurant listings rather than to individual hotels, airlines, restaurants and retailers. It also warned that because of the new requirements around data-sharing, many of Google’s recommendation features “won’t work in the same way anymore,” suggesting life could become less convenient for users who revoke their consent.Meanwhile, Apple has said that requirements to support third-party app stores could expose iOS users to greater amounts of spammy or malicious software, due to Apple’s weakened control over app developers.“The new options we’re introducing to comply with the DMA necessarily mean we will not be able to protect users in the same way,” Apple wrote in a white paper it published last week ahead of Thursday’s compliance deadline. “The changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap” between EU users’ security and the security Apple users enjoy outside the EU, it added.That may have a kernel of truth, but proponents of the DMA have said it can be difficult to determine where legitimate objections to the law end and where self-interest begins.As companies begin to comply with the letter of the DMA, expect some to try to evade its spirit by using consumer scare tactics or “dark patterns,” subtle interface designs intended to nudge users toward sharing more of their data or making other choices a company prefers, Reyna said.“These include misleading language such as ‘use for free’ when consumers pay [for a service] with their data,” BEUC wrote in a report last week. “Data protection options are buried in a maze of settings, and the use of contrast and colours for the ‘accept’ and ‘refuse’ buttons can steer users to the response the gatekeeper wants.”Some companies are already accusing tech giants of flouting the law.On Wednesday, Epic Games published emails showing Apple blocked its request this month to launch a third-party app store on iOS in Europe. In a complaint to EU officials, Epic said Apple justified the decision by referencing Epic’s past deliberate violation of Apple’s app store terms and Epic’s public criticism of Apple.If Apple’s decision is allowed to stand, it will mean tech giants can thwart competition and undermine the law just by pointing to a rival’s past efforts to call out anticompetitive behavior, said Tim Sweeney, Epic Games’ CEO.Past US court rulings have upheld Apple’s right to cut ties with Epic for any reason, Apple said in a statement. “In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”The European Commission has asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA, a Commission spokesperson told CNN Thursday. The EU’s executive body is also evaluating whether Apple’s actions “raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU rules, the spokesperson added.Thursday’s deadline is the final opportunity for gatekeeper companies to submit detailed plans to the European Commission showing how they will comply with the DMA.After reviewing the plans, which could take weeks or months, the commission may choose to launch investigations into companies suspected of noncompliance. Those probes could last for up to one year. Even after the plans are reviewed, the commission could still launch compliance investigations at any time, particularly if it receives complaints from the public.The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group representing four of the six gatekeeper companies — Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta — told CNN that “regulators need to resist the urge to politicize the process” of reviewing the plans.DMA enforcement “should be proportionate and unbiased, taking into account the significant differences between gatekeepers, as well as how these services work in reality,” said Daniel Friedlaender, senior vice president of CCIA and head of its Europe office.Friedlaender warned that the DMA could also frustrate consumers by leading to “product updates they don’t want” or that they could see “changes to their favorite services they really don’t like.”Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/big-changes-apple-google-other-110038832.html
2024-03-07 10:40:00+00:00,"This 1 Chart Shows How Microsoft Became the Biggest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock and World's Most Valuable Company","Earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company. With a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion, Microsoft is currently worth about $400 billion more than the iPhone manufacturer and stands atop the illustrious list of ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.Following Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) lead, Microsoft began building its own cloud infrastructure business in 2008. In 2010, the company launched its Azure cloud platform. But Azure wasn't really in a state that would allow it to be a credible competitor to Amazon Web Services (AWS) until 2013.Coinciding with the appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO in 2014, Microsoft reorganized and reclassified its business segments. The company also began placing a much bigger emphasis on cloud and subscription-based businesses. While this shift helped drive substantial sales and margin growth for its productivity-and-business-processes segment, the company's intelligent cloud segment and the Azure unit within that segment have been even bigger performance drivers.As the chart shows, intelligent cloud revenue has grown at a rapid pace -- and the segment is now Microsoft's biggest overall sales driver. For the company's 2023 fiscal year (ended June 30, 2023), the segment generated sales of $87.9 billion and accounted for roughly 41.5% of the business's $211.9 billion in total sales. The division also accounted for roughly 43% of the $88.5 billion in operating income that Microsoft posted that fiscal year.Strong performance for the Azure unit and overall intelligent cloud segment has continued in the current fiscal year and helped Microsoft become the world's most valuable company. While AWS remains the overall market leader in cloud infrastructure services, Azure continues to gain market share and it sees strong demand tailwinds in conjunction with the rise of artificial intelligence.Even though Apple continues to generate more revenue than Microsoft, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business helps it have lower costs and achieve superior margins. Thanks to rapid growth and strong profits from the intelligent cloud segment, the software giant tops the list of the world's most valuable companies.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-07 08:54:35+00:00,Europe's Digital Markets Act is forcing tech giants to make changes. Here's what that will look like,"LONDON (AP) — Europeans scrolling their phones and computers this week will get new choices for default browsers and search engines, where to download iPhone apps and how their personal online data is used.They're part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act, a set of European Union regulations that six tech companies classed as “gatekeepers” — Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — will have to start following by midnight Wednesday.The DMA is the latest in a series of regulations that Europe has passed as a global leader in reining in the dominance of large tech companies. Tech giants have responded — sometimes reluctantly — by changing some of their long-held ways of doing business, such as Apple allowing people to install smartphone apps outside of its App Store.The new rules have broad but vague goals of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable."" They are kicking in as efforts around the world to crack down on the tech industry are picking up pace.Here's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:WHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES?Some 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media platforms, will be in the DMA's crosshairs.They include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and Android operating system, plus Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari Browser and iOS.Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's Windows and LinkedIn.The companies face the threat of hefty fines worth up to 20% of their annual global revenue for repeated violations — which could amount to billions of dollars — or even a breakup of their businesses for “systematic infringements.”WHAT EFFECT WILL THE RULES HAVE GLOBALLY?The Digital Markets Act is a fresh milestone for the 27-nation European Union in its longstanding role as a worldwide trendsetter in clamping down on the tech industry.The bloc has previously hit Google with whopping fines in antitrust cases, rolled out tough rules to clean up social media and is bringing in world-first artificial intelligence regulations.Now, places like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and India are drawing up their own versions of DMA-like rules aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.""We’re seeing copycats around the world already,"" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. The DMA “will become the defacto standard” for digital regulation in the democratic world, he said.Officials will be looking to Brussels for guidance, said Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London.“If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA to avoid fragmentation and the risk of taking a different approach that fails,” he said.HOW WILL DOWNLOADING APPS CHANGE?In one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes installed on its mobile devices.The company has long resisted such a move, with a big chunk of its revenue coming from the 30% fee it charges for payments — such as for Disney+ subscriptions — made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that “sideloading” apps will come with added security risks.Now, Apple is cutting those fees it collects from app developers in Europe that opt to stay within the company’s payment-processing system. But it's adding a 50-euro cent fee for each iOS app installed through third-party app stores, which critics say will deter the many existing free apps — whose developers currently don't pay any fee — from jumping ship.“Why would they possibly opt into a world where they have to pay a 50 cent per-user fee?” said Avery Gardiner, Spotify's global director of competition policy. “So those alternative app stores will never get traction, because they’ll be missing this huge chunk of apps that would need to be there in order for customers to find the store attractive.""“That is utterly at odds with the very purpose of the DMA,” Gardiner added.Brussels will be closely scrutinizing whether tech companies are complying.EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said this week that after 10 years on the job, “I have seen quite a number of antitrust cases and quite a lot of creativity built into how to work around the rules that we have.""HOW WILL PEOPLE GET MORE OPTIONS ONLINE?Consumers won't be forced into default choices for key services.Android users can pick which search engine to use by default, while iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their go-to. Europeans will see choice screens on their devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.The idea is to stop people from being nudged into using Apple’s Safari browser or Google’s Search app. But smaller players still worry that they might end up worse off than before.Users might just stick with what they recognize because they don't know anything about the other options, said Christian Kroll, CEO of Berlin-based search engine Ecosia.Ecosia has been pushing for Apple and Google to include more information about rival services in the choice screens.“If people don’t know what the alternatives are, it’s rather unlikely that many of them will select an alternative,” Kroll said. “I’m a big fan of the DMA. I am not sure yet if it will have the results that we’re hoping for.”HOW WILL INTERNET SEARCHES CHANGE?Some Google search results will show up differently, because the DMA bans companies from giving preference to their own services.So, for example, searches for hotels will now display an extra ""carousel"" of booking sites like Expedia. Meanwhile, the Google Flights button on the search result display will be removed and the site will be listed among the blue links on search result pages.Users also will have options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising based on their online activity.Google users are getting the choice to stop data from being shared across the company’s services to help better target them with ads.Meta is allowing users to separate their Facebook and Instagram accounts so their personal information can't be combined for ad targeting.The DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other. Meta, which owns the only two chat apps that fall under the rules, is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can exchange text messages, videos and images.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/europes-digital-markets-act-forcing-051231799.html
2024-03-06 22:27:12+00:00,Epic Games: Apple terminated our developer account,"Epic Games, the company behind the popular ""Fortnite"" video game, says Apple (AAPL) has terminated its developer account, with Epic calling it a ""serious violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act."" It's the latest volley in the battle between the two companies.Watch the video above to hear Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley explain the feud.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Apple dealing a blow to Epic Games. The video game software company saying Apple terminated its developer account preventing the development of the Epic Games Store for iOS. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Josh. This all comes down to what's known as the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. Basically, it establishes that there are certain key players in the technology space. And because of their size, they have to allow for certain capabilities for other companies.And so for Apple being a key player, they essentially have to allow third party apps to build third party app stores. They no longer have to rely on Apple's App Store as the sole place to download apps. Now Apple and Epic have had a tumultuous relationship, to say the least. Apple pulled the game ""Fortnite"" and Epic's ability to develop games for iOS after Epic in a kind of showdown with the company over pricing for apps sold through its App Store went ahead and changed prices on its own and allowed a third party means of purchasing apps through the App Store.All of this is to say they don't like each other. And now Epic is claiming that because of comments that CEO Tim Sweeney made regarding Apple's upcoming changes to the App Store in Europe, that is supposed to abide by that Digital Markets Act, the Apple has gone ahead and pulled the ability for Epic to actually go ahead and build its own third party app store and put games on iPhones.And so this is a larger problem that Apple will have to potentially deal with when it comes to the European Union and European Commission as far as antitrust goes. It's clear that Epic is not going to stand by. It's clear that Apple is not going to abide by Epic kind of I guess rankling them. And so now we're going to have to see what happens when the two come to blows.JULIE HYMAN: And what does this mean for Epic in the long run?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, Epic hasn't been allowed to sell ""Fortnite"" on iOS for a while. They were going to be able to do this again, in Europe at least, not in the US, nowhere else, but in Europe in particular. And so it means that there's a loss of potential revenue here that could impact them over the long term.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/epic-games-apple-terminated-developer-222712373.html
2024-03-06 22:01:07+00:00,UPDATE 5-Apple escalates Epic Games feud by blocking Fortnite app in EU,"(Rewrites throughout with background about Epic's dispute with Apple)By Akash Sriram and Stephen NellisMarch 6 (Reuters) - Apple escalated its feud with Epic Games on Wednesday, blocking the Fortnite video-game maker from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.The two companies have been in a legal battle since 2020, when the gaming firm alleged that Apple's practice of charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iPhone Operating System (iOS) devices violated U.S. antitrust rules.The latest challenge from Epic comes as Apple struggles with concerns abouttepid demandfor its iPhones in China, and its stock has tumbled 12% so far this year, underperforming its big tech peers in the U.S. Its shares were largely unchanged on Wednesday.Attempts by regulators and competitors such as Epic to pave the way for rival marketplaces on Apple's devices are a major threat to the Silicon Valley heavyweight's profits and control of its own ecosystem.European lawmakers are forcing Apple to allow those third-party marketplaces with a law called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that takes effect this week.Separately,Brussels antitrust regulatorson Monday fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, Apple's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.Epic was working to take advantage of the DMA, but Apple blocked those efforts on Wednesday, citing Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. Epic had created the account in an effort to put Fornite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. Apple must allow third-party stores on its devices, under the new European law.The developer accounts are important because software creators cannot distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without one. Apple had previously terminated some of Epic's developer accounts in 2020, after Epic purposely broke Apple's in-app payment rules, using its violation of the rules and subsequent banishment from the App Store as the core of public relations and legal campaign against Apple.Apple said on Wednesday the court rulings have made clear that it has ""sole discretion"" to terminate any Epic Games developer account in light of its ""egregious"" breaches of the company's developer agreements.""In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right"" to terminate Epic Games' account, Apple said.Epic alleged that by terminating its account, Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.""This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,"" Epic Games said.The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple in January proposed certain changes ahead of a March 7 deadline to comply with certain conditions of the DMA, a legislation meant to make it easier for European users to move between competing services.The company said it would allow alternative app stores on iPhones and an opt-out from using the in-app payments system, but set a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year for developers who sign up for the new regime.

2024-03-06 21:45:05+00:00,Magnificent Seven's AI plays are losing investor interest,"Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) are all experiencing declines, highlighting the challenges faced by these tech titans in the current market environment. Tesla and Apple are grappling with slowing demand in the crucial Chinese market, a development that has raised concerns about their growth prospects in one of the world's largest economies.On the other hand, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is facing challenges related to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence. While AI has sparked the interest of investors, Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills joins the Live Show to break down why AI alone is not enough to sustain investor engagement.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: Both Apple and Tesla ending the day lower after several sessions of declines. Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills here with her takeaways for the day. And this kind of speaks to what I was just saying is that we're starting to see some of these divergences.MADISON MILLS: We're seeing the divergences, and we're getting a lot of fun pithy names from the street. Josh and I were talking about this, the three AI amigos you mentioned.JOSH LIPTON: That was Gene Munster.MADISON MILLS: Steve Sosnick today telling me it's the Fantastic Four, which I find interesting. My take, which people would pay millions of dollars for, of course, is that there are three winners, one survivor, and three losers here. So you have Apple, Tesla really struggling year to date.And I want to talk about their exposure to China, because that's one of the primary drivers to the challenges that they're having. With Tesla, we've got weak deliveries in China. Apple's local iPhone sales are struggling. And then you have Alphabet, which announced an AI-driven image search functionality earlier this year that they had to take off the market in under 24 hours because of challenges with that AI.That leads me to my second point here, the AI and mentions of AI are not enough. You actually have to be able to use it, imagine that. It has to work in order for the market to be happy about it. And there's really no better case for that than Nvidia, which, by the way, as Jared was mentioning, that sea of green over there, Nvidia has maintained that sea of green this week, even when we've seen some sell-offs. So continuing to see Nvidia lifting up the broader market here.In terms of what's next, it seems like these AI plays that can win on not only the use case, but also the fundamentals, keeping those sales up in spite of any, you know, decreased sales out of regions like China, that is going to be the key for this rally moving forward.JOSH LIPTON: It was interesting to talk about that AI thing, we just spoke to Doug Clinton over Deepwater. And his firm's a shareholder, but clearly expressing some real frustration there. Yeah--JULIE HYMAN: With Alphabet you mean?JOSH LIPTON: With Alphabet, yeah.MADISON MILLS: It doesn't work. And so if you introduce something to the market that doesn't work yet, you can't really be surprised when people aren't happy about that, I would imagine. But then I'm also-- I'm interested in Microsoft. Obviously, they're up on the year. So I think we have a chart showing the Magnificent Seven names compared year-to-date.They were the clear winner of AI because of OpenAI, of course, but really trailing the likes of Nvidia, of course, in the Magnificent Seven trade year-to-date. And I'm curious about whether they're going to be able to have a catalyst for more growth moving forward on AI or if that's just priced into the name at this point.JULIE HYMAN: Well, it's also interesting as we talk about now that some of them are lagging. And yet up until a couple of days ago, the market was continuing to make new highs, which sort of lends credence to the idea, as some strategists we've been talking have been saying, that there is a broadening that's been happening.Nancy Tengler, I think, called it a quiet broadening, right?MADISON MILLS: Stealth broadening, stealth, yes.JULIE HYMAN: Stealth broadening in the market that's been happening. So the idea for so long that the market could not go up unless all of these guys were going up, that now seems to be going away a little bit.MADISON MILLS: Yeah. We had this UBS note saying, rain or shine, whether you've got the Fed raising rates higher for longer, cutting rates, or whether you have all of the Magnificent Seven performing well, to your point, Julie, it seems like this market is going to go up regardless. As long as Nvidia is there, we're good.JULIE HYMAN: Stocks go up.MADISON MILLS: Stocks go up. Yes, exactly.JOSH LIPTON: Madison, thank you so much. Appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/magnificent-sevens-ai-plays-losing-214505243.html

The stock now off 10% from its most recent high. Jared Blikre is here with a look at the next levels traders are watching. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Thank you, Josh. It's getting ugly out there. We can see behind me, this is a year to date chart in Apple. And we just fell out of bed because 180 was a support level to watch there. And we have now traded under it for about three straight days.Now I'm going to go to a three-year chart so I can show you some of the levels that are of interest below the current price. So 165 is really where I think the rubber meets the road right here. So 169, pretty close to that. Then you have the 150 area. I also include maybe 145.But then the real biggest support that I'm seeing is around 120 to 125, and that is way down there. Now that would be an extreme move, and it probably wouldn't happen overnight. And it doesn't have to happen over all. But one of the interesting things that's happened over the last few days is the market has come down so fast, Apple stock has come down so fast, it is oversold. And in fact, there's something called the relative strength indicator, it is now printing a 22 out of 100.Now anything under a 30 is considered oversold. And when this happens, a lot of times there's a mean reversion. So I ran the statistics, and here's what it's looking like for when we get a drop below the RSi below 25 and then it pop back above. Going back 25 years, it's happened 12 times. But the statistics are really bad over the next few days. Negative or over the next two days, the next one week, the next two weeks, and one month. You have to go out to a quarter.So it might not be the best time to be buying Apple right now. And I'll just close with an Apple seasonality, this is average returns per month.

2024-03-06 20:13:31+00:00,ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,"ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman's firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.What does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.While there is a more…nefarious side to ChatGPT, it’s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it. Prior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (a super-charged version of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model) and a multimodal API. OpenAI also unveiled the GPT store, where users could create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT. Though the launch was delayed in December, it officially launched in January.GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT. Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.March 2024February 2024January 2024December 2023November 2023 October 2023September 2023August 2023July 2023June 2023May 2023April 2023March 2023February 2023January 2023December 2022November 2022ChatGPT FAQsOpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps.

It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution.After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences “verbatim.” Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be ""fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support."" Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow.In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.”Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.Snapshot of how we’re preparing for 2024’s worldwide elections:• Working to prevent abuse, including misleading deepfakes• Providing transparency on AI-generated content• Improving access to authoritative voting informationhttps://t.co/qsysYy5l0L— OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 15, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsIn an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of “military and warfare.” In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to “harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.”Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community.To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans — ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.the GPT store is live!https://t.co/AKg1mjlvo2fun speculation last night about which GPTs will be doing the best by the end of today.— Sam Altman (@sama) January 10, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsFollowing a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the UK, OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.”OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.”We build AI to empower people, including journalists.Our position on the @nytimes lawsuit:• Training is fair use, but we provide an opt-out• ""Regurgitation"" is a rare bug we're driving to zero• The New York Times is not telling the full storyhttps://t.co/S6fSaDsfKb— OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 8, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsAfter being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch.

Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI’s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.After launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT’s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.OpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a “low-key research preview” evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: “what a year it’s been…”a year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning’s launch.what a year it’s been…— Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT’s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta’s Threads.A test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI’s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word “poem” forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.According to a new report by SlashNext, there’s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.Following speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa’s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT.

The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.Even if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the ""headphones"" icon.The only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.“Obviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they’re not going to be in OpenAI,” Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was ""open"" to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.A number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company's board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT's future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.Sam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company’s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board “no longer has confidence in [Altman’s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.”In a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI “was transformative” for him and “hopefully the world.”OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.Following OpenAI’s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus’ new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.An independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety. OpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that’s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.As opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says — largely due to technical hurdles.Users and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI’s marketplace and monetize it in the future.After being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.DALL-E 3, OpenAI’s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI’s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.Bowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don’t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.OpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.At its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build “agent-like experiences” within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.OpenAI’s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it’s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like “Chat & Ask AI” and “ChatOn — AI Chat Bot Assistant”, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.Subscribers to ChatGPT’s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.OpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.The integration means users don’t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.A Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the “trustworthiness” — and toxicity — of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of “jailbreaking” prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.OpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures — dropping from 30% to 20% in September.OpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB— OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsOpenAI announced that it's adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.The Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT — accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot — receiving the results directly within the chat app.Powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.The new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system’s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.ChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds ""enterprise-grade"" privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.Recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn’t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company's API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model’s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the “feel” of the model’s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.Fine-tuning costs:Training: $0.008 / 1K tokensUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokensUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokensIn OpenAI's first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.“We’re very excited for the impact they’ll have here at OpenAI,” OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. “The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.”OpenAI announced that it's expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple's China App Store ahead of the country's latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.“As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),” Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. “Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.”A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.ChatGPT is available to ""pre-order"" for Android users.The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version’s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too — so if you’re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don’t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.The company said this feature lets you “share anything you’d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.” For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI's flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ""false, misleading, disparaging or harmful"" statements about people.TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ""with a history of successful payments"" can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.OpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.The Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting “GPT-4” in the model switcher and choosing “Browse with Bing” from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.U.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car’s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car “Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.”It's not really clear what for, though.The new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.On iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet’s interface.The Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that “no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,” or if it was, that it was checked “by a human being.”The list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.OpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.The ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries — Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon!— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices — meaning it will know what you’ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices.“In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.”VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.Called ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as “for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.”“ChatGPT Business will follow our API’s data usage policies, which means that end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.”OpenAI applied for a trademark for “GPT,” which stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the “myriad infringements and counterfeit apps” beginning to spring into existence.Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI’s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide “appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.”That means a decision could take up to five more months.Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI's latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ""autonomously"" perform tasks.Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself.FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud in a congressional hearing.“AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated.The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat’s AI features.Italy’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data.The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get the regulator's compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4.YC Demo Day's Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ""ChatGPT for X."" They’re all chasing after a customer service software market that’ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:Yuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.Baselit, which uses one of OpenAI's text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.Lasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they'd like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.BerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.The letter's signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.”The letter reads:Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot's functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it’ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.GPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.ChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft’s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be “Microsoft managed customers and partners,” can apply here for special access.OpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.At a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.Other companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord -- putting the pressure on Big Tech’s AI initiatives, like Google.After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for ""ChatGPT Professional"" as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.OpenAI said that it's ""starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT"" in an announcement on the company's official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no ""blackout"" windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT — “at least 2x the regular daily limit.”A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers -- Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston -- made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI’s answers with the world.GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that’s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.Most recently, Microsoft announced at it's 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.Much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.ChatGPT's generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been ""learning"" for a longer period of time than Bard.A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.Yes.Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is ""coming soon.""It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder -- if not impossible -- to run today.The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind’s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ""legitimate interest"" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/06/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/chatgpt-everything-know-ai-powered-210339686.html

2024-03-06 18:28:23+00:00,Magnificent 7 Price Targets: What Each of These Stocks Could Be Worth in 2030,"The Magnificent 7 stocks have captivated investors over the past few months with their meteoric rise. These heavyweight tech names have propelled much of the market’s gains in recent years. But not all of the Magnificent 7 have delivered equally magnificent returns. While titans like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue charging ahead, stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have lagged.Yet, even amidst their mixed trajectories, it’s worth taking a step back to consider where each of these influential stocks could be headed over the long-run. As they scale to new heights, momentum seems to be driving share prices more than fundamentals. That’s often a sign of overvaluation. Many believe a meaningful correction could hit some of these names in the coming months or weeks.That said, I remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for these innovative companies. By 2030, they could each reach entirely new levels if they maintain dominance in their core markets. But how high could each stock realistically climb? Let’s take a look!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers, and for good reason. This stalwart has not fully embraced the AI and data boom powering much of the recent gains in this group. With iPhone sales plateauing, Apple looks like a company stuck in the past to many investors. Losing its crown as the largest company to Microsoft only added insult to injury.However, underneath the surface, Apple has quietly built a foundation for future growth. Its new Vision Pro VR headset, despite a hefty $3,499 starting price, has sold over 200,000 units as of the end of January, exceeding expectations. VR and AR remain early-stage markets, so the demand for this product has limits for now. But Apple is laying the groundwork in a potentially massive arena.Meanwhile, Apple recently bested Q4 expectations, proving reports of its demise were premature. Critics argue the company is still too slow in pursuing AI. However, with Apple snapping up AI startups and making key hires, bears may soon be proven wrong. This sleeping giant could rejoin the party in the coming years. If Apple capitalizes on its strengths in hardware and combines it with AI expertise, the stock could eclipse $500 by 2030.Source: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains a top Magnificent 7 buy. Yes, its premium valuation of 43-times earnings and 3-times sales raises eyebrows. But the company’s growth prospects justify these multiples. Analysts forecast Amazon’s earnings per share will triple from 2024 to 2033 amid double-digit revenue growth. I believe Amazon could even exceed these projections.Several factors drive this potential. AWS maintains strong demand as cloud adoption rises. Additionally, Amazon’s AI investments are starting to bear fruit across its divisions. The company is firing on all cylinders – even making healthcare inroads via Amazon Pharmacy and the OneMedical acquisition. E-commerce leadership provides a wide moat. Developing in-house chips will also result in massive cost declines for the company’s chip needs in its AWS segment.This is a business executing on all fronts. AI permeates every segment, from e-commerce to pharma. Amazon simply has too many levers to pull in too many growing markets to be stopped. I see AMZN stock reaching $750 or more by 2030, depending on how far into the future markets are willing to extrapolate this growth story.Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has lagged behind its peers in capitalizing on AI, but it is catching up fast. Concerns have emerged as ChatGPT seemed poised to disrupt the company’s core Google search business. But neither ChatGPT nor Bing made a dent in Google’s supremacy. Meanwhile, Alphabet has kept its head down developing its own powerful AI.Upgrading Bard with Gemini showcased Alphabet’s progress. Then came Gemma and Gemini Ultra, which the company claims is the most advanced model yet – even surpassing GPT-4. The validity of this claim is uncertain. But clearly, Alphabet has closed the AI gap. Google Cloud growth also underscores its momentum, with Q4 revenue up 26% to $9.2 billion.Alphabet appears well-positioned for the AI age after weathering the ChatGPT threat. Google search retains its dominance, as the company expands into new technologies. With the company firing on all cylinders again, I see substantial upside ahead. If the company maintains momentum in cloud and AI, GOOG stock could fetch more than $400 per share by 2030. For a stock that’s lagged its peers, the future looks increasingly bright for Alphabet moving forward.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comI’ve long been bullish on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) despite the stock market’s harsh treatment of the stock in 2022. Shares plunged below $100 as Meta invested heavily in its future vision. I pounded the table on META stock from $120 down to $90 before its sharp rebound.Meta’s bets on AR and VR seem premature today. These technologies remain in their early stages of development, with limited near-term returns. But Meta’s core apps – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – are cash cows. Yes, teenagers shun Facebook. However, social media networks are still seeing overall user growth. And notably, Instagram and WhatsApp have young demographics locked down.As I wrote in October, Meta’s valuation looked fair based on 2023 estimates. Had Meta paid dividends over investing in the metaverse, it may have appealed more to long-term shareholders. Lo and behold, Meta recently initiated a dividend – making it more attractive to additional investor types.My 2025 target of $400 proved conservative as shares hit $500 in early March. But I now believe $850 per share is achievable by 2030. That’s a modest projection, given Meta likely cools off after this breakout over fair value.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft has rocketed higher since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. Its AI investments via OpenAI sparked today’s hype. Indeed, Microsoft 365 remains essential for office productivity. By combining its software suite with AI, Microsoft is enabling more and more efficiency.Its data center business is booming as well. Microsoft’s AI investments across its business units are paying dividends. This stalwart should stay vital for the foreseeable future, delivering further upside. A $1,200 target by 2030 seems reasonable given Microsoft’s expansive reach, as the company makes big bets in emerging fields like quantum computing.Microsoft has its hands in every facet of tech. The company has defined past eras of computing and appears positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation too.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comI’m bearish on Nvidia in the near-term. Semiconductors are cyclical, but investors get carried away and became downright euphoric during the recent AI-fueled rally. We saw huge gains this past year that I expect to reverse, much like the 2000 dot-com bubble.Several headwinds face Nvidia investors. Many tech giants are developing their own AI chips rather than buying from Nvidia. With these firms also backing AI startups, Nvidia’s dominance in this space may wane. Moreover, rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are rolling out powerful new AI chips. It’s only a matter of time before they catch up.Nvidia remains a momentum stock today. I believe long-term holders can still profit, but likely after weathering steep losses first. Even with these headwinds, $1,300 per share by 2030 seems achievable for NVDA stock.Source: franz12 / Shutterstock.comTesla has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers recently. But don’t count this EV giant out over the long-term. The culprit driving this recent decline has been rising rates and tight money weighing on the EV sector. Once rates drop, Tesla and its peers should see growth reaccelerate.Consider Tesla’s massive runway. Only 1% of vehicles are electric today. Tesla has no serious U.S. competitors. And while overseas rivals are gaining steam, they’re unlikely to ever dominate the U.S. market, with most such foreign competitors focusing on hybrids anyway. As the U.S. moves to electrify its fleet in the coming decades, Tesla remains the EV giant to beat.Tesla also leads in batteries, charging infrastructure, and technology. It has carved an enviable niche that should propel growth once macro conditions improve.The stock may tread water until rates decline. But with most of the company’s future growth still ahead, Tesla charging toward a $600+ level by 2030 seems reasonable.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-06 17:28:39+00:00,SEC adopts landmark climate rule — here's what that means for public companies,"For the first time, US public companies will be required to tell investors about their exposure to climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions.On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved requiring US-listed companies to communicate how they are managing material risks related to climate change and how those risks affect their bottom lines. Large companies will also be required to disclose their direct emissions from their operations and energy use, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.""I think it's important for the US to have its own standards based on US law, based on the economics of our markets, based upon what investors here are using to make investment decisions, and I think today's action is that important step for our US capital markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said during the meeting. ""These roles will enhance the disclosures that investors have been relying on to make their investment decisions. Issuers and investors will benefit from the consistency, comparability, reliability of these disclosures.""The measure passed 3-2 along political lines following two years of review and over 24,000 comments on the proposal.The SEC notably pared back the final ruling, trimming a provision that would have required companies to report their Scope 3 impact — that is, indirect emissions from suppliers and consumers.The Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.SEC's exclusion of Scope 3 data is considered a win for many businesses given that indirect emissions make up the largest and fastest-growing category of emissions.Scope 3 categories include emissions from purchased goods, employee commutes, projects financed, and the use of products sold, among others. In the oil and gas sector, Scope 3 emissions can account for up to 95% of emissions; in financial services companies, the figure is even higher at up to 99%.Nevertheless, the landmark ruling by Wall Street's top regulator sets mandatory requirements — detailed in the SEC press release — that provide greater consistency, comparability, and reliability in climate data so that investors and consumers can make more informed decisions.""I think what's kind of most important is that the information begins to flow,"" Bryan McGannon, managing director at US SIF (the Sustainable Investment Forum), told Yahoo Finance. ""So even if it doesn't include Scope 3 information, investors are going to get, for the first time, companies reporting their climate risk.""Josh Griffin, co-founder and chief policy officer at NZero, a climate data platform, told Yahoo Finance that companies are ""seeing that their customers want a better understanding, and it’s showing up in market choices. Companies that not only invest in technologies to reduce their emissions but [also] are transparent about their efforts are being rewarded by their customers. This is where these regulatory requirements from the SEC are so vital because they create consistency and shared expectations.""The landmark rule will affect thousands of companies, many of which already provide this information publicly on a voluntary basis or to comply with other regulations.Companies will now face four main types of disclosure requirements when they register with the SEC and in their annual reports: what their climate risks are, how they are adapting to those risks, how the board of directors is overseeing climate strategy, and how climate targets will affect the business.Large non-exempt companies will also have to list their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Many already track that information: As of 2022, nearly all S&P 500 companies and 90% of Russell 1000 companies published sustainability reports, according to the Governance & Accountability Institute.""There are fairly well-established methods for being able to build out Scope 1 [data],"" Rob Fisher, the US ESG Leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""Scope 2, frequently, it's not overly complicated. There are many aggregation services ... that are able to get your Scope 2 emissions.""The SEC expects large corporations such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Exxon (XOM) to begin reporting their climate risk-related information in their fiscal year 2025 and to report their greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal year 2026. They will also need to submit a limited third-party review of their emissions data by 2029 and a full audit by 2033.Smaller companies and emerging growth companies will have an additional two years to disclose their climate risks and will not be required to report their emissions, which provides space for new technological developments to evolve.""The climate rule [that] got issued in March 2022 was basically before the rise of generative AI,"" KPMG's Fisher noted. ""And now, you know, things have kind of gone crazy. … So, I think the intersection of AI and this new reporting requirement is quite interesting because we can do some things very differently now in how we address the rule this time around than we could last time.""Fisher noted that for ""most organizations, building out a Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas inventory is certainly not trivial, depending on the scope and size of the operation. But certainly ... the big thing is that the data generally resides inside the virtual four walls of the organization.""How prepared they actually are to meet these requirements is not entirely clear. A KPMG survey found that 4 out of 5 companies say they are ahead of their peers when it comes to sustainability reporting, yet nearly half still lean on spreadsheets to manage data instead of advanced data systems.""The tools are more readily available and more seamless for companies to gather their Scope 1 and 2 emissions,"" nZero's Griffin said. ""Scope 3 still presents a lot of challenges because of jurisdictional issues, but the market for collecting such data has also grown quite a bit in the last two years.""The SEC's rule marks a step up in climate disclosure requirements, and it's been a long time coming.Since 1971, the SEC has recommended that companies communicate the cost of complying with environmental regulations. In 2010, the agency went further to suggest that companies should voluntarily provide details about their exposure to climate risks, if material.Increasing extreme weather events, scrutiny around inflated sustainability claims, and pressure from activists, investors, and governments only heightened the pressure for mandatory disclosures.By 2021, the SEC began seeking feedback on the shape of climate disclosure policy. When it released its draft proposal in March 2022, it drew polarized responses from groups on both sides of the aisle that only intensified as ESG investing became a political lightning rod.And while the rule has been finalized, the issue is far from settled. Lawsuits against the SEC are virtually guaranteed, experts say, something Gensler has been preparing for.Although the removal of the Scope 3 rule may lessen the risk of litigation from the US Chamber of Commerce, American Farm Bureau Federation, and National Association of Manufacturers, it could provoke the opposite reaction from green groups.""I think what has taken them long to come to the final rule was to make sure that what was in the final rule is as durable as possible to withstand litigation challenge,"" US SIF's McGannon said. ""I think they went to really great lengths to ensure that the rule would stand.""Companies have also been closely watching whether the SEC's rule would align with disclosure requirements that have gained traction around the world or else join what Fisher called a ""patchwork quilt"" of regulations that collectively raise compliance costs.One benchmark is the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which took effect on Jan. 5, 2023. The EU law has a broader definition of materiality that includes human and environmental impacts as well as financial impacts. The EU also mandates reporting of Scope 3 emissions, which the SEC stopped short of.The United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong have also set climate reporting standards. And earlier this year, China hinted at joining them.Then there's California's climate disclosure law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in October 2023, which made the state the first in the US to approve such a measure. It also set the stage for legislators in New York and Illinois to follow suit with their own climate disclosure bills.California's two climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, go much further by requiring disclosures from both private and public companies that do business in the state. Those with revenues over $500 million must publish their climate risk plans, and those with over $1 billion in revenue are required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.The effect is that many large multinationals or companies with operations in California will be required to report Scope 3 emissions even if the SEC is not requiring them to do so.""Scope 3 may be out of the SEC’s climate rule but it’s very much in scope for US multinationals and likely many private companies,"" Fisher wrote in an email following the decision. ""The SEC’s rule followed actions of the EU, California, and the ISSB, all of which require Scope 3 reporting. Regulatory relief in one jurisdiction does not alter the burden imposed in others.""Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/sec-adopts-landmark-climate-rule--heres-what-that-means-for-public-companies-172839134.html

2024-03-06 16:26:21+00:00,Apple Looks Most Oversold in Years After $200 Billion Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has struggled in 2024, and the recent weakness has the stock looking like it is the most oversold in years, analysts said.Most Read from BloombergChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilNikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden RematchNew York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight CrimeStocks and Bonds Climb as Powell Sticks to Script: Markets WrapEgypt’s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in ReachShares of the iPhone maker are down 14% from a recent peak and have dropped 12% this year, compared with a gain of 7.42% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Apple shares have been pressured by concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union.The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday, its sixth straight negative session. The 7.2% decline over that six-day drop has erased more than $200 billion in market capitalization.“At some point this hate is going to be too much, and most oversold in six years seems like a good place to start,” Michael Toomey, head of TMT trading at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a note to clients.He said the length of the stock’s underperformance relative to the Nasdaq 100 has been notable, adding that “feels like every day we get another negative AAPL datapoint, and it’s not particularly cheap.”Jefferies looked at the relative strength index of long Apple positions versus short positions in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. Based on this, “this is the most oversold AAPL/QQQ has been since early 2018.”Bespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a post on X that Apple is more than three standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, and that “it hasn’t been this oversold since March 16th, 2020 in the throes of the COVID crash.”Even with the stock’s recent weakness, Apple shares trade near 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average multiple of 19.Despite the selloff, options traders are showing few signs of fear, buoyed by the broader optimism about the biggest technology stocks.Implied volatility for three-month options has picked up from recent lows, but is around the middle of the range for the past year. And the put skew, measuring the premium investors will pay for protection against a decline, is holding near a two-year low.--With assistance from David Marino.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for WorkersThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairWhy Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-looks-most-oversold-years-162621064.html

Jared, what are you seeing?JARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm seeing a marked difference from yesterday. You can see tech express through the NASDAQ, and also the Russell 2000, small caps, both up 1%, clawing back some of those big losses we had yesterday.As you were saying earlier, earlier in the year, January 2 was the last time we had a tech sell-off in XLK of that strength. But then, look what's number one today, XLK up 1% followed by E for energy, then materials, communication, services, and real estate. All of those outperforming. In fact, as you can see, everything in the green here.And just kind of continuing on Mady's theme of the bifurcation that we see in the Mag Seven, and just in general in big tech, there is Apple. Really stands out. It's trading to the downside, not by a lot. But just check out this one-year chart. I've been tracking this support level here at about $165. And we are heading down to that level, just about $5 away.And on a three-year basis, you can see, if we break this level probably heading to what-- $150, $125-- something in there. So this does have repercussions. Apple is still a very important bellwether stock for the market.Do want to mention bonds here quickly, because we have the 10-year T-note yield hovering near one-month lows. You'd have to go back to February to see what's happening there. In terms of the price level, that's 4.12% for that rate. It's down one basis point there. We've been seeing rates go down. And it's unusual in that the NASDAQ usually does the opposite of what rates do, but we've seen kind of the opposite with that recently.All right, just with a few seconds to go, I want to check out what's happening with crypto. Give you a quick pick-- there we go. Quick peek at the Bitcoin price, $67,178.

2024-03-06 13:13:36+00:00,Trade of the Day: Profit Off Recent Weakness in Apple (AAPL) Stock,"If there was one company that grabbed business headlines the most on Tuesday, it would have to be consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). According to a CNBC report, AAPL stock dragged the broader tech space down. An unflattering report urged investors to approach the stock carefully, sending shares down 3%.Counterpoint Research stated yesterday that Apple iPhone sales in China dropped a staggering 24% in the first six weeks of 2024. The company faces increasing competition from local smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo.That presents massive questions for longer-term viability. After all, AAPL stock has long thrived on its brand and pricing power. Consumers are willing to pay extra for the privilege of owning Apple products – and thus becoming integrated with its ecosystem. Lose that advantage and AAPL could sharply correct over the next several months as investors digest this new reality.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere’s our game plan: We don’t care.If you’ve ever watched a professional baseball game, you know that players don’t swing at every pitch. Instead, they analyze the pitch count and many other factors that could influence the next pitch thrown. In some sense, baseball players are data analysts, waiting for the right moment to swing the bat.That’s a similar situation to what we have with AAPL stock here. Because shares suffered a steep drop yesterday, there’s a good chance that Apple could open today’s session in the red.Notably, since the beginning of October 2023, whenever the opening price of a session was lower than the prior day’s closing price, there is a 55.4% chance that the price of the current session will end higher. Further, when the opener is positive, there’s a 54.9% chance that the current session will likewise end higher.Chart by Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace.com In other words, AAPL stock has an upward bias in its near-term pricing dynamics. And when the opening price is negative, the bulls are just that extra bit motivated to push shares northward.We’re going to use this math to our advantage.Armed with Apple’s pitch count, we’re going to swing the bat if AAPL stock opens below Tuesday’s closing price of $170.12. Statistically, this should give us the best odds of AAPL moving higher.To make this trade work, we need leverage, and that’s where Apple’s call options come into play. In particular, I’m looking at the slightly out-of-money (OTM) 8 March 2024 $172.50 call. On Tuesday, this contract closed with a premium of 95 cents. Using Barchart’s options calculator, if AAPL stock rises to $171 (a little more than a 0.5% move), the contract value could theoretically jump to $1.26.Please be aware that no matter what happens, you need to enter this trade today and exit today. Due to the derivative market’s time decay, you can’t afford to spend quality time with this option.

2024-03-06 12:56:07+00:00,Fed Chair Powell is about to get grilled by Congress. Here’s what markets want to hear,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Uncertainty around the economy and the Federal Reserve’s next moves has cast a shadow over Wall Street this month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a chance to provide more insight when he testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.Markets have whipsawed between new highs and precipitous drops as contrasting economic data cause confusion about what the Fed will do next.That market seesaw could continue this week as Powell’s semi-annual congressional testimony provides investors with a rare opportunity to hear the Fed head’s views on a range of topics from inflation to regional bank health.Here’s what investors will be listening for, and reacting to, over the next two days.Inflation expectations: Powell’s messaging on Fed policy over the past few months has been fairly consistent — he’s made it clear that he’s in no rush to cut interest rates.“Basically, we want to see more good data. It’s not that the data aren’t good enough. It’s that there’s really six months of data. We just want to see more good data along those lines,” he said on 60 Minutes last month.But that statement came before a month of not so good data — price rises accelerated in January from the previous month and wholesale inflation saw its biggest monthly increase since August.Those reports pushed back market bets on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. The majority of investors are now expecting an interest rate cut at the Fed’s June policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Just one month ago they thought it would be in May.Investors will closely listen for any hints from Powell about what the Fed is looking for, data-wise, before it begins to lower interest rates.Economic outlook: Even as inflation surprised to the upside last month, the economy held up better than expected.After more than 20 months of inflation above the Fed’s 2% target and higher borrowing costs, investors, economists and — eventually — Federal Reserve officials said they expected the economy to soften this year, allowing the central bank to finally start cutting rates.But economists at S&P 500 Global Ratings now expect US real gross domestic product to grow by 2.4% in 2024, up from their forecast of 1.5% in November. The labor market remains incredibly resilient, with unemployment at historic lows and wage inflation elevated.Investors will look to Powell to comment on how long he thinks the economy can perform well while interest rates are high.Powell will also be asked about the economic pain Americans are feeling as a result of elevated inflation and interest rates.Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, told Politico that he’s thinking of asking Powell why “the American public does not feel as if the economy is anywhere close to the level that I know it to be based on my everyday involvement with this committee.”Americans have been struggling with higher prices, especially for essentials like rent, groceries and gas. Food prices rose 0.4% between December and January, the highest monthly rate in a year. Mortgage rates have climbed for four weeks in a row.Regional banks: “We’ll be listening for any commentary from Powell on the soundness of regional banks in light of their commercial real estate exposure,” said Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar.New York Community Bank announced that it had taken large hits in its commercial real estate exposure earlier this year, and shares of the bank have tumbled to their lowest level since 1996 after the beleaguered regional lender said in a filing last week it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls.The news sent the bank’s bonds tumbling as well as investors worrying about more disruption to the regional banking sector.The stock was further pressured Friday after Fitch Ratings downgraded NYCB’s debt to junk status and Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating further into junk territory.What could happen: Don’t expect Powell to be too forthcoming.As former Fed economist Claudia Sahm said it in her latest newsletter, “It would be un-Fed-like to tell us how many more months of good data it needs to be confident [of cutting rates].”Powell is expected to emphasize the need for more patience. Federal Reserve officials, including Powell, have repeatedly said they envision at most three rate cuts in 2024 and indicated that they’re in no rush to get there.Goldbugs are rejoicing as their favorite precious metal continues to reach new heights, reports my colleague and Before the Bell co-writer Krystal Hur.The price of gold rose on Tuesday to settle at $2,141.90 a troy ounce, notching another record high as investors continue to bet the Federal Reserve will cut rates in the back half of the year.Gold is considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metal. However, some investors also believe gold to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that it will hold its value even if it begins to surge.It’s not just traders trying to get in on the gold rush. Costco started selling gold bars last September and sold more than $100 million during its fiscal first quarter of 2024. The precious metal tends to be popular during times of global economic unease, since it’s a tangible asset and less risky than stocks.iPhone sales in China dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report, adding to significant problems for Apple and other Western tech companies in a crucial market, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly.Analysts from Counterpoint Research said the overall mobile market in China fell by 7% with companies including Apple, Oppo and Vivo experiencing declines.But the problem for Apple has been ongoing for a year as China’s economy slows down and trade tensions and nationalism heat up. Customers that once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands, particularly Huawei, Counterpoint said.“Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,” Mengmeng Zhang, a Counterpoint senior analyst, said in a press release. “Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now.”Apple shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 11.6% this year on concerns about weakening sales, particularly in China.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/fed-chair-powell-grilled-congress-125607997.html
2024-03-06 11:59:00+00:00,META Stock Analysis: 3 Reasons to Buy Meta Platforms Now,"What a tear Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been on this year. Indeed, the tech giant remains a top choice for tech investors, given its robust AI presence. In 2024, META stock delivered four quarters of impressive results, including its first dividend and $40.1 billion in sales, surpassing estimates.CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s commitment to AI is evident through Meta’s Artemis AI chip development and recent board additions like Broadcom’s Hock E. Tan and John Arnold.Meta Platforms’ stock has surged 180% over the past 12 months, and trading near its all-time high, right around $500 per share at the time of writing. Investor confidence has returned as advertising rebounded, fueled by expanded buyback and dividend initiatives. Despite a trillion-dollar market cap, Meta lags behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose iOS updates affected ad sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the tough competition, META stock is still a hard-to-beat competitor. Here are three reasons why I think META stock is still a buy, even at these elevated levels.In the fourth quarter, profit surged by 203%, exceeding previous increases of 31% and 168%. Sales growth also accelerated from 11% to 23% and 25%. Daily active Facebook users reached 2.11 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. Additionally, operating margins rose to 41% from 20% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Analysts anticipate 52% earnings growth in 2024 and 10% in 2025. Institutional buying surged, reflected in a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Meta’s robust performance in 2023 likely bolstered management’s confidence in initiating a dividend. Free cash flow surged to nearly $44 billion, while cash and marketable securities reached $65.4 billion, surpassing its $18.4 billion debt. Revenue growth accelerated, with a 25% increase in the fourth quarter, contrasting with a 4% decline a year ago.Total 2023 revenue rose 16% while operating costs increased by just 1%, showcasing impressive operating leverage. This disciplined approach fueled substantial cash generation, positioning Meta as a prime candidate for dividend payouts alongside stock repurchases, a strategy already underway by management.Meta’s financial analysis suggests it could have initiated dividends earlier. Despite a 50% decline in free cash flow in 2022, it remained at $19 billion. Shareholders benefited indirectly through $31.5 billion in stock buybacks, showcasing Meta’s commitment to returning capital. However, it had yet to introduce dividends.Post-rebranding, Meta Platforms has become a pioneer in AI integration in the metaverse, boosting immersive experiences with features like voice commands and custom AI chips.Based on projections, Meta likely won’t surpass Apple’s valuation over any time frame, but it holds more significant potential for growth at least in the near-term. Indeed, META stock would need to double to match Apple’s market cap, with many pointing to AI as the reason for such a move. However, despite Apple’s low single-digit earnings growth and high valuation, it’s also true that Meta looks relatively expensive compared to its top- and bottom-line growth numbers right now.Still, plenty of attention will remain on the Meta Quest headset as a value alternative to Apple’s Vision Pro. Partnering with LG Electronics, Meta aims to bolster its XR business, enhancing its virtual and augmented reality position. With ventures into AI-driven advertising, social media, and the metaverse, Meta remains poised for substantial growth, justifying its 32.6 price-earnings multiple.Meta stock broke out from a three-week tight pattern, hitting a high of more than $500 per share. This move has been driven by strong demand for retail and institutional investors, inviting analysts to revise theri price targets higher.The IBD Leaderboard stock hit a record high on Feb. 23, with a 38% gain year-to-date. Approaching $500, META stock has soared since late October, riding its 10-week moving average with muscular relative strength. Additionally, BofA Securities raised Meta Platforms’ price target to $425 from $405, citing potential growth drivers like digital advertising and reel performance. These analysts currently maintain a buy rating on the stock.I’ve been pounding the table on META stock for years, even as the stock was declining during the previous bear market. Much of that has to do with the company’s core cash cow of a business, and its ability to remain flexible in investing in the businesses of the future. I think Meta has the right management team for the job, and remains a stock worth owning here.Yes, Meta is much more expensive than it’s been in some time. But it’s my view that investors looking for a growth stock to hold for the next decade or longer really can’t go wrong with this name right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Honor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, saw a 2 per cent increase in sales, giving it 16.3 per cent of the China market.Counterpoint said Huawei benefited from strong demand for its flagship 5G-capable Mate 60 series, launched late last year with a powerful home-grown chip, the Kirin 9000S.

2024-03-05 23:28:40+00:00,"UPDATE 4-US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa","(Adds Dell statement, paragraph 12)By Jonathan StempelMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""Dell said in a statement it was committed to upholding the human rights of workers throughout its supply chain, and has never knowingly sourced products made with child labor.Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show. None was named as a defendant.The case is Doe 1 et al v Apple Inc et al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-7135.

2024-03-05 23:21:36+00:00,"Apple revises its DMA rules after pressure, but keeps the Core Technology Fee intact","No, Apple's new and controversial ""Core Technology Fee"" isn't going away for EU app developers who opt into the iPhone maker's new business terms designed to comply with the region's Digital Markets Act. However, today Apple is announcing a handful of smaller concessions driven by feedback from its app developer community, it says. Notably, the company will now no longer require that corporate entities must sign up for the new DMA terms along with all their sub-accounts, nor will it require a standby letter of credit. In addition, the move to opt into the DMA terms is no longer a one-way switch. Instead, developers under certain circumstances will have the option for a one-time switch back to the existing terms -- meaning the standard 15% to 30% commission, not the reduced one under the new rules.However, these changes don't address the major complaints with Apple's DMA rules, which involve reducing commissions on App Store purchases in favor of other new fees. At issue is Apple's institution of a new ""Core Technology Fee,"" which requires developers to pay Apple €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold for apps distributed outside its App Store.Larger developers like Spotify and Epic Games have lashed out at Apple's plans to ""comply"" with the DMA, calling its plan ""extortion” and “bad-faith” compliance, among other things. Other tech companies, including Meta, Mozilla, and Microsoft have also criticized Apple's DMA rules, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the requirements were ""so onerous"" he didn't see how any developer would be able to adopt them. A consortium of developers, led by Epic and Spotify, also penned an open letter to the European Commission, asking the government to assess Apple's compliance and take “swift, timely, and decisive action"" against the tech company to protect developers.Apple didn't make any move to adjust its fee structure with these new changes. Rather, it's adjusting some of the more obviously less compliant terms -- like the rule that said that marketplace app developers would need a €1,000,000 letter of credit from an A-rated financial institution to receive the DMA entitlement. That would prevent individual and smaller developers from signing up, which would mean Apple wasn't fully in line with the law.The other change will allow a larger corporate entity to pick and choose which of its developer accounts opt into the DMA rules, and which do not at the developer account level. Before, Apple was requiring that corporations sign up each membership it controls if it chose to opt into the DMA rules. That also doesn't make sense, as various arms of a larger corporation should be able to make their own business decisions and act accordingly.Apple may have known in advance that these sorts of rules wouldn't fly and chose to pull them back ahead of a directive to do so as a gesture of compliance and ""listening"" to its community.Another change sounds like it would make it easier for developers to test the DMA rules and then switch back, but that's not necessarily the case.Instead, Apple says developers can terminate the DMA Addendum one time without terminating their Developer Agreement -- but only if ""you have never had an Application be an Alternative App Marketplace (EU), be distributed through an Alternative App Marketplace (EU), use Linking Out, or use Alternative Payment Processing.""In other words, if the developer never actually began to do business under the new terms.Signing the agreement doesn't give developers the ability to terminate their agreement a second time if they have already done so, the company says. Plus, Apple says it will still invoice the developer terminating its agreement for the Core Technology Fee, which has to be paid within 30 days. They can then choose to opt back into the DMA rules at a later date, if desired.Apple announced these changes to its DMA rules alongside the launch of Xcode 15.3 and the latest SDKs for iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, tvOS 17.4, visionOS 1.1, and watchOS 10.4. Developers can now begin to submit apps under the DMA terms, Apple says, and can now measure the number of first annual installs their apps have accumulated.The company additionally updated its App Review Guidelines to include references to the new DMA rules, including that app developers cannot copy the names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative marketplaces. It also says that alternative app marketplaces cannot compile personal information on users unless they specifically consent, nor can they use public databases to collect that personal information. It also says apps that don't comply with its guidelines will be blocked from installation -- including via alternative app marketplaces.Spotify, Epic Games and others pen letter to EC, claiming Apple has made a ‘mockery’ of the DMAThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/apple-revises-its-dma-rules-after-pressure-but-keeps-the-core-technology-fee-intact/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-revises-dma-rules-pressure-201204552.html
2024-03-05 22:15:28+00:00,Tech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks came under pressure as a trio of tech heavyweights fell, with traders wading through mixed economic data in the run-up to Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackStocks Kick Off Key Inflation Week Under Pressure: Markets WrapThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, DirectorEquities lost traction after a rally that has spurred concern about sky-high valuations — especially in megacaps, leaving the group vulnerable to big moves in the face of bad news. Apple Inc.’s iPhone woes in China deepened while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US roadblock in selling an artificial-intelligence chip to the Asian nation. And Tesla Inc. extended its rout as China shipments slumped.Bullish positioning in US technology stocks is at the highest in three years — raising the risk of a pullback, according to Citigroup Inc.’s Chris Montagu. Long positioning in Nasdaq 100 futures is “extremely extended,” he said.“Trees don’t grow to the sky,” said Kenny Polcari at SlateStone Wealth. “What is starting to concern some investors is whether or not some of these tech companies that have gotten stretched can in fact live up to the ‘lofty valuations’ that investors have placed on them.”Wall Street also weighed data showing the US service sector cooled — even as orders and business activity picked up. Caution prevailed, with Powell heading to Capitol Hill for his semiannual testimony before Congress, where the Federal Reserve chief is expected to reiterate the lack of urgency to cut rates.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, while the Nasdaq 100 slipped almost twice as much. Tesla extended a two-day selloff to 11%, while Apple suffered its fifth straight loss. Nvidia Corp. rose. Treasury 10-year yields fell six basis points to 4.15%. Bitcoin slid after a record-setting run that topped $69,000. Gold also hit an all-time high.Never miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.The “Magnificent Seven” — comprising Apple, Microsoft Corp., Nvidia, Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla — have powered the S&P 500 to all-time peaks this year, partly fueled by the AI frenzy.The rally has left strategists scrambling to lift their 2024 targets — while raising questions on whether tech is seeing a boom or a bubble.To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic, the dramatic rally in US equities and Bitcoin signals accumulating froth — conditions that typically precede a bubble when asset prices rise at an unsustainable pace. Meanwhile, David Kostin at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among those who argue big tech’s lofty valuations are supported by fundamentals.The so-called Magnificent Seven saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group helped drive the Nasdaq 100 to its fourth consecutive monthly gain.“The AI craze is a modern gold rush, and the tech ‘picks and shovels companies’ are seeing earnings explode as companies buy chips and cloud space to fuel the boom,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. “But if AI doesn’t result in increased profitability for the rest of the S&P 500 over the coming years, then demand for AI chips will evaporate as will AI-related cloud demand.”With generative AI set to be the growth theme of the decade, UBS’s Chief Investment Office continues to believe that US tech stocks should make up a substantial portion of investors’ equity allocations. However, the firm says investors with excessive exposure should consider broadening tech exposure to capture the next growth opportunities.“While we see further room for the current tech rally to run, we think investors should review and optimize their exposure to technology to protect against potential declines and benefit from opportunities beyond big tech,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.“Although we see pockets of speculation and the tech sector could be due for a breather, we don’t see a bubble,” said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. “Valuations are rich on most metrics, but with tech, comparative earnings momentum tends to be a more important near-term driver. And profit trends remain strong and are at new highs.”The three-year outperformance of the tech sector to the S&P 500 is just above 30%, Lerner said. This is roughly in line with the 30-year average and far from the peak of just above 250% seen in March 2000, he added.“Comparisons to the dot-com bubble should be expected given the concentration of gains in the tech sector and proliferation of excitement around a new technology,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird. “But from 1996 to 1999, the average three-year trailing return was 96%. We are not yet close to those levels. There’s room to run.”Valuations, earnings trends and market sentiment all refute speculation that an AI-driven tech bubble has reemerged in US large caps, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“Our theme universe of AI stocks shows sales generally supporting price gains, with multiples in the middle of their five-year range,” they wrote. “Unless fundamental shortfalls emerge, high-market-cap concentration for mega-cap tech and strong returns for AI may not present material risk to the S&P 500.”The largest five companies in the S&P 500 trade at less than half the multiples of the “Four Horsemen” — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell Technologies Inc. — in March 2000, which surpassed 80 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis, according to BI.Additionally, valuations appear to be relatively contained across accelerating technology themes — such as AI, future of finance, cloud and robotics — with most baskets trading at or beneath five-year average price-to-sales multiples, they said.“While we stand by our argument that US stocks are not in a bubble, the confluence of a prospective Fed easing cycle and an attention-grabbing new technology does raise the risk that one might form later this year and into 2025,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “The easiest way to sidestep this problem would be for the Fed to delay rate cuts as long as possible.”While stock prices are not part of the Fed’s official mandate, Colas says he’s wondering whether Powell will try to dampen the market’s recent enthusiasm by delivering a more hawkish than expected message this week.“The AI frenzy combined with expectations for rate cuts in 2024 renewed ‘bubbly’ investor behavior,” according to the GMO Asset Allocation team. “If the projected Fed cuts fail to occur or growth companies fail to deliver on aggressive expectations, growth investors will likely wind up disappointed.”Corporate Highlights:CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. gave a forecast for revenue and profit in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling strong customer demand for the company’s expanding suite of cybersecurity offerings.Nordstrom Inc. is forecasting muted revenue and comparable sales growth this year as sluggish demand at its high-end namesake stores offsets an improving outlook at its off-price Rack stores.Target Corp.’s fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, as the retailer continued its improvements in inventory management and said its decline in traffic slowed.Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger is “extremely confident” that the company will meet its goal of showing a profit in its streaming TV businesses in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.A Citigroup Inc. reorganization aimed at streamlining the bank and making it more competitive with its peers has gone swifter than expected, Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said, as she set out positive guidance for the year ahead.New York Community Bancorp climbed after the stock tumbled 43% in prior two sessions after a pair of rating downgrades.Zillow Group Inc. fell after short seller Spruce Point Capital Management said it was betting against the stock and highlighted challenges facing the company, including antitrust litigation targeting broker commissions in the US housing industry.Key Events This Week:Canada rate decision, WednesdayEurozone retail sales, WednesdayUS ADP employment, JOLTS job openings, WednesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee, WednesdayFed issues Beige Book, WednesdayFed’s Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis) and Mary Daly (San Francisco) speak, WednesdayChina trade, forex reserves, ThursdayEuropean Central Bank’s rate decision, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, trade, ThursdayPresident Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union address, ThursdayFed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, ThursdayCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, ThursdayEurozone GDP, FridayUS nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, FridayNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, FridayECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann speaks, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 1% as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.8%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%The MSCI World index fell 0.8%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro was little changed at $1.0858The British pound rose 0.1% to $1.2705The Japanese yen rose 0.4% to 149.92 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 7.9% to $62,170.83Ether fell 4.7% to $3,415.67BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined six basis points to 4.15%Germany’s 10-year yield declined seven basis points to 2.32%Britain’s 10-year yield declined 11 basis points to 4.01%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $78.16 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.7% to $2,129.88 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Alexandra Semenova and Yvonne Yue Li.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tech-giants-drag-down-us-221528886.html

This follows news from yesterday of a $2 billion EU antitrust fine, shares of Apple sliding to their lowest level in roughly four months. Joining us now to talk all things Apple Ben Bajarin, creative strategies and CEO and principal analyst. Ben, it is always good to have you on the show.So let's start on that headline today, Ben. So listen, the stock's down today again. And it looks like it's on this headline from counterpoint research saying iPhone sales they plunged. According to their research, 24% in the first six weeks of the year. Rival Huawei, Huawei they say going the other way unit sales actually surged more than 60%. How worried, Ben-- if you're reading this, you're an Apple investor, how worried are you-- how concerned are you about that headline?BEN BAJALIN: Yeah. I mean, not terribly concerned, I think most investors we talk to take the long view in iPhone sales. I think the quarter over quarter fluctuations, people understand that there's still broad softness in China, especially at the high end. I think if you look at some of the sales that's happening there from local brands, even some of the surge from Huawei is not entirely in the high end. And I think most people who look at some of the underlying data and know that in China, Apple's retention rates-- so loyalty and intent to buy iPhones going forward remains the highest of any brand.And I think we're just continuing to see some of this delay in the high end refresh that we've been watching for the last few quarters in China. And on top of that, I think it's becoming again abundantly clear that the refresh rates in China, especially in the high end are elongating and that's really impacting everyone. But to this point again with Huawei, it doesn't look like they are taking share from Apple, they're again-- they're recovering from a very small base after the sanctions that were hit on them.So like I said, I think everybody is holding the long view. And within that view, it seems like things will normalize and be relatively stable on par in terms of expectations in China for the year.JOSH LIPTO: I'm just interested to push on that point though, Ben, China is such a critical market for Tim Cook. But when they last reported December quarter, China sales down 13% year over year. So I guess, when do you see that changing then? Is that near intermediate term?BEN BAJALIN: Yeah. I think there's been optimism that we're starting to see some of that recovery probably from March into the middle of the year. And then obviously it goes soft again right on the heels of new iPhone launches. There's obviously a whole lot of discussion around how much anticipation is there for the next iPhone. I think there's been a huge debate around, will consumers-- iPhone consumers in China wait, even push their upgrade cycle even longer toward the end of the year hoping that some GenAI stuff comes for Apple in the next platform launch.So I think there's a little bit of that, I mean, obviously, to your point, which is correct. I think there's been the criticism that the iPhone was just not as big of a year-over-year upgrade enough to really move a cycle. I think, again, I keep coming back to this. This doesn't mean that sales are gone, it's just that sales are delayed. And so I do think we're seeing some optimism that that's refreshing now. But obviously I do think there'll be a big spotlight on the fall as Apple integrates AI and what that next iPhone could be in terms of satisfying more of that pent up demand that we feel is in China.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/why-optimism-apple-must-delayed-214852585.html

How do I handle this gracefully?On Tuesday, all three major indexes suffered their largest daily point and percentage decline since Feb. 13, while booking back-to-back losses after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back Monday from record finishes scored at the end of last week , according to Dow Jones Market Data.Tuesday’s trading session saw investors taking a cautious tone, with megacap tech stocks tumbling, dragging the market further from record highs reached over the past few weeks. So far, the year has been good for U.S. stocks as investors have navigated moderating inflation, consistent economic growth and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.However, until investors see a fresh round of economic data and speeches on these topics later this week, it’s still a risk-off mood in the financial market — at least for equities. Bitcoin BTCUSD notched a new record high on Tuesday morning, briefly moving past $69,000 , before plummeting to trade above $63,000 a coin Tuesday afternoon.There’s good reason for the scrutiny, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “This is an important week for a market that has been pricing in a host, a series, of rate cuts,” she told MarketWatch via phone on Tuesday.Investors will brace for remarks from Fed Chair Powell — who is expected to deliver monetary-policy updates to the House of Representatives on Wednesday and to the Senate on Thursday — while listening hard for clues on the pace, timing and extent of any interest-rate cuts for the rest of 2024, she said.Until then, Krosby said she saw the selloff on Tuesday as a “healthy” consolidation, because investors “need to digest the gains” from last few weeks.Greg W. Halter, director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel, also said the pullback was natural, adding that some investors may seize the chance to take profits and shift into the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 that are trading at lower valuations.“The market is broadening out, but the question of debate is can the market [continue to] go higher if you don’t have Microsoft MSFT, Apple and Nvidia NVDA being the leaders,” Halter said in a phone interview with MarketWatch.In U.S. economic data on Tuesday, the ISM service-sector PMI fell to 52.6% in February from 53.4% in January, marking a bigger-than-expected drop . Still, a number over 50% signals economic expansion, where the index has been since December 2022.Factory orders also fell 3.6%  in January, dragged down by fewer contracts for passenger airplanes from Boeing.Tuesday also saw pressure from a dip in Apple Inc.’s AAPL shares weighing on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500. The company’s shares fell 2.8% after a report that iPhone sales in China  fell 24% during the first six weeks of the year .

2024-03-05 21:30:42+00:00,Apple iPhones sales fall 24% in China amid competition and headwinds,"iPhone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report, adding to significant problems for Apple and other Western tech companies in a crucial market.Analysts from Counterpoint Research said the overall mobile market in China fell by 7% with companies including Apple, Oppo and Vivo experiencing declines.But the problem for Apple has been ongoing for a year as China’s economy slows down, and trade tensions and nationalism heat up. Customers that once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands, particularly Huawei, Counterpoint said.“Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,” Mengmeng Zhang, a Counterpoint senior analyst, said in a press release. “Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now.”Apple shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 11.6% this year on concerns about weakening sales, particularly in China.The company did not respond to a request for comment.The report comes amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, higher unemployment of younger workers and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.China remains a very important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Apple previously made a lot of gains during its launch period last year. The company continues to offer discounts to help ameliorate some of the downturn.Last year, Huawei’s Mate 60 made headlines when the US government sought more information about the Pro model which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.Now, some Chinese consumers think they’ve been wronged by the US government sanctions and are gravitating toward Huawei’s Mate 60 smartphone, which is edging into Apple volumes.Jeff Fieldhack, a research director with Counterpoint, told CNN part of the issue is that Apple had a strong January last year due to part shortages, but didn’t experience shortages in January this year.“This isn’t a major deal for Apple in the long term,” he said. “It is still a successful iPhone launch and there is more discounting and marketing they can do this year in China to help alleviate the competition from Huawei.”Huawei in January represented 17% of the mobile market share in China, compared to Apple’s 16% share. Huawei demand is higher than its supply, which means it could in theory be selling more, Fieldhack added.“Apple, to its credit, ended the year at number one, which was extraordinary despite headwinds from China,” he said.CNN’s Krystal Hur contributed to this reportFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphones-sales-fall-24-213042555.html
2024-03-05 21:28:25+00:00,"US STOCKS-Tech-heavy Nasdaq leads Wall Street lower as megacaps, chips slide","*US services sector cools in February, ISM survey shows*Target forecasts FY comparable sales above estimates*Apple drops after China iPhone sales plunge*Indexes down: Dow 1.04%, S&P 1.02%, Nasdaq 1.65%(Updates with final prices after market close)By Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur KamdarMarch 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street three major indexes all retreated more than 1% on Tuesday, with weakness in megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc and the chip sector weighing most on the Nasdaq ahead of this week's crop of economic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Tuesday's economic data was a mixed bag showing slower U.S. services industry growth in February as employment declined while a measure of new orders grew to a six-month high, signaling underlying strength in the sector.The Purchasing Managers Index report on Tuesday confirmed continued economic growth despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Fed since March 2022.Another survey showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped more than expected in January.Some strategists saw the technology sell-off on Tuesday as the result of profit taking for a sector which had recently rallied after rising 56% in 2023.""Maybe some people are taking chips off the table, taking some profits in the high flying areas, in conjunction with what is probably justified nerves before Powell speaks and before we get the big slew of labor market data,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Two reports helped to create a risk-off tone, said Craig Fehr, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones in St. Louis.Apple shares finished down 2.8% after a research report showed iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 as Apple faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.Also the chip sector was battered after Bloomberg News reported that Advanced Micro Devices hit a roadblock in its efforts to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market as Washington cracks down on advanced technology exports to Beijing.Chip rivals fell in sympathy with the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which closed down 2%.Fehr also attributed some of Tuesday's weakness to recent rallies. The benchmark S&P 500 had hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower.""It's reasonable and even healthy to take some pit stops along the way. This market is, to a degree, stopping for a breather after what's been a very sharp run higher,"" he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 404.64 points, or 1.04%, to 38,585.19. The S&P 500 lost 52.3 points, or 1.02%, at 5,078.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 267.92 points, or 1.65%, to 15,939.59.Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 industry indexes declined, with technology ending down 1.2% and consumer discretionary falling 1.3%. Energy, up 0.7%, was the biggest gainer followed by consumer staples, which rose 0.3%.Along with Powell's testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday, investors are also anxiously awaiting more clues about interest rate policy from economic data, including the crucial non-farm payrolls report, due out on Friday.The majority of traders see the first rate cut this year in June, as per CME Group's FedWatch tool.Among megacap technology stocks, Tesla shares sank 3.9% after its European Gigafactory near Berlin halted production following a suspected arson attack.On the bright side, Target shares rallied 12% after the retailer forecast annual comparable sales largely above estimates, betting on same-day services, product launches and a new membership program to boost spending.Microstrategy shares tumbled 21% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 113 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 13.22 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.99 billion average for the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard Chang)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/us-stocks-tech-heavy-nasdaq-212825396.html
2024-03-05 20:50:03+00:00,Apple Shares Are Tanking. Here Are Levels Traders Are Watching,"(Bloomberg) — Traders are eyeing Apple Inc. after its stock slid below a critical psychological threshold on Tuesday as shares entered a technical correction for the first time since August this month.Most Read from BloombergApple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales PlungeTech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets WrapGold Climbs to Record as Momentum Builds on Bets Over Fed PivotOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised.America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop.The shares, which failed to hold the $180 support level last week, traded for less than $170 at various points during Tuesday’s session. Breaking through that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities.“Apple is one of the most influential stocks so it may see a bounce from here in the short-run after being oversold,” Sohn said over the phone. “But traders may still look to fade it at $180 because its trend has deteriorated so much.”Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company have shed nearly 12% this year after closing at a record in December, erasing more than $300 billion in market value. That’s cost Apple its crown as the most valuable US company to Microsoft Corp., as some of its Big Tech peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. keep rallying.Apple is facing a slew of issues, including regulatory scrutiny of its App Store, declining sales in China and investor concerns over its growth prospects. Its fourth-quarter outlook also raised worries due to tepid demand for its handsets and other gadgets.Naturally, short sellers are pouncing. Apple was the the stock market’s second-most profitable short position in February at $606 million in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.Read more: Apple Shorts Eye Key $180 Level With CautionWith Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that technology shares broadly may face pressure in the coming months, even with Nvidia’s dominance. The iPhone maker continues to set new lows relative to the $252 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.That said, Birinyi Associates found that Apple’s correlation to the S&P 500 isn’t as tight as some may think. On a scale where 1 means a perfect directional relationship and 0 indicates no relationship at all, Apple clocks in at 0.65 compared with 0.69 for Nvidia and 0.36 for the average S&P stock, according to Jeff Rubin, director of research at Birinyi.From a technical perspective, this means the US stock market can continue to churn higher as long as Apple’s stock doesn’t break its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.“While this isn’t an intermediate-term concern, and there’s ample evidence that ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks can certainly carry markets higher without the aid of Apple,” Newton wrote in a note to clients. “I view all weakness in Apple over the next month as likely making this stock quite attractive.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for WorkersPrivate Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a DatabaseThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-shares-tanking-levels-traders-202301385.html
2024-03-05 19:46:24+00:00,VUG vs. VGT: Which Tech-Heavy ETF Is the Better Buy?,"ETFs allow investors to diversify their capital without much effort. Fund managers either take an active approach and carefully monitor individual positions or align their funds with established benchmarks. Vanguard is one of the leading firms that specializes in these types of funds. This article will dive into two popular Vanguard funds, one of which is tech-heavy, while the other is tech-exclusive: the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).I am bullish on both of these funds, but it’s important to know the nuances of each fund before getting started. This article will examine their similarities and differences so you can decide which one makes sense for you.Both of these funds have been neck-and-neck over the past year. VGT is up by 48.2%, while VUG has gained 47.8%. There is a larger gap between the funds when looking at five-year performances. While VGT gained 166.1% during that time, VUG was only up by 121.6%.Even though VGT has been the clear winner over the past five years, it’s hard to complain about the performance of either of these funds.Investors don’t even have to worry much about these funds’ expense ratios eating away the returns. Vanguard is well-known for having low expense ratios for its funds, and the brokerage firm certainly delivers for these picks. VUG has a 0.04% expense ratio, while VGT has a 0.10% expense ratio.There’s more to VUG and VGT than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, these two stocks are the largest positions in both funds by wide margins.VUG offers more portfolio diversification for assets outside of these two tech giants. Microsoft makes up 13.2% of the fund’s total holdings, while Apple consists of 12.2% of the fund’s total assets. More than a quarter of VUG’s total holdings are in those two stocks.VGT is even more lopsided toward those tech conglomerates. The fund has 20.5% of its total assets in Microsoft and puts 20.2% of its capital into Apple. Those two stocks make up more than 40% of VGT’s total holdings.VUG has the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven within its top 10 holdings. However, VGT deviates from this trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the only other Magnificent Seven stock within the fund’s top 10 holdings, as you can see below.While the five-year returns imply VGT is the better pick, this is a classic case of past results not guaranteeing future success. Although VGT has a big lead for that time horizon, VUG has outperformed it over the past six months. VUG is also the year-to-date winner, with a 10.5% return compared to VGT’s 8.6% return.I believe this trend will continue for a few reasons. The first reason is Apple stock. Although shares are up by 320% over the past five years, they are only up by 14.4% over the past year. Apple stock is actually down by 4% over the past six months.More than 20% of VGT’s portfolio is down by 4% over the past six months. That distinction only applies to roughly 12% of VUG’s total portfolio. Now, Apple can turn things around if the Vision Pro becomes the next big product, and I believe that product has the potential to deliver great returns. However, the rest of the company’s growth slowed down significantly and offers very limited upside other than the Vision Pro.Another big reason VUG looks more enticing is the portfolio composition. With Apple’s growth slowing, investors have to pay more attention to the other stocks in these funds’ portfolios. While both funds have Nvidia as their third largest holding, the funds deviate from there.VUG takes the expected approach of loading up on the Magnificent Seven stocks. That’s proven to be a good long-term decision, and those corporations have plenty of runway, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for now.I also have an issue with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) being VGT’s 9th largest holding. That stock makes up 1.56% of the fund’s total assets but hasn’t budged by much over the years.Cisco stock is down by 6% over the past five years. While its dividend puts the investment in the positive, that’s not the pick you want to see in a growth fund’s portfolio. VGT has better five-year returns, but I believe VUG is poised to perform better over the next five years.VUG is rated as a Strong Buy based on 172 Buys, 35 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average VUG stock price target of $378.47 implies 12.5% upside potential.Meanwhile, VGT is rated as a Moderate Buy, with 231 Buys, 76 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VGT stock price target of $575.87 implies 11.5% upside potential. Nonetheless, analysts’ ratings suggest VUG will continue to extend its recent lead.Comparing stock charts doesn’t always yield the correct answer of which fund is the better pick. That seems to be the case with these funds. VGT has the better five-year returns but was more reliant on Apple’s ascent. VUG still has significant exposure to Apple but is better prepared for a slowdown in that stock.If Apple’s Vision Pro turns the stock into a winner again, VGT will outperform VUG, but that’s not guaranteed to happen. Both of these funds are heavily dependent on Microsoft and Apple, but it looks like VUG has better top 10 holdings than VGT.Disclosure",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/vug-vs-vgt-tech-heavy-194624798.html

Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.Its failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.Lord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.A Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:We saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services. We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”NBC News has reported on comments by a senior official from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in a call with journalists. The official said:We are aware of the incident and at this time we are not aware of any specific election nexus or any specific malicious cyber activity.Surging demand for weight-loss drugs helped to save Denmark from recession last year, a leading bank has said. Hannah Boland reports:Danske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.The stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.Analysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”Novo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.The company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.Sales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.High levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc.The FTSE 100 closed up 0.08pc today. The biggest riser was Intertek, up 6.15pc, followed by Endeavour Mining, up 4.24pc. The biggest faller was industrial equipment rental company Ashtead, down 9.36pc, followed by components supplier RS Group, down 3.51pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.11pc. The biggest riser was Spirent Communications, up 63.28pc, followed by Trustpilot, up 8.38pc. The biggest faller was automotive distributor Inchcape, down 8.23pc, followed by Aston Martin, down 6.06pc.Some of Google’s services are experiencing problems this afternoon, after users of Meta’s Facebook and Instagram encounter a significant outage.YouTube is experiencing reports of outages on the website Downdetector. Meanwhile, Google’s Ad Manager is experiencing “service disruption”, according to its official status page, while Google is “investigating reports of an issue” with its AdMob and AdSense services. These are used by advertisers.Here’s an update on our earlier mention of a Facebook outage reported by tens of thousands of people.Users of Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Messenger platforms are experiencing login issues in what appears to be a widespread outage.Internet traffic observer Downdetector is reporting big outages across the world.London-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said on X that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “currently experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.” But the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering,” which are typically imposed by governments.Andy Stone, Meta’s head communications, acknowledged the issues on X, formerly known as Twitter, and said the company is “working on this now.”A French billionaire vying to buy British grocery haulier Wincanton has dropped out of the takeover race.CMA CGM, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Rodolphe Saadé, said it would not be increasing its 480p a share offer.The move ends a bidding war between CMA CGM and rival GXO Logistics.US-based GXO offered a knockout bid of 605p a share last week, double the Wincanton share price prior to the takeover battle.The higher offer has the support of Wincanton’s largest shareholders, Aberforth Partners, Threadneedle, Wellcome Trust and Polar Capital. Shares in Wincanton fell 4.5pc to 596p.The business was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate.Today its main business is running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose.Tesco is to increase store workers’ pay by 9.1pc in an act worth roughly £300m.It is the latest supermarket group to lift pay levels for workers ahead of the rise in the national minimum wage in April.The national minimum wage will increase from its current rate of £10.42 per hour to £11.44 on April 1.The grocery giant, which employs more than 330,000 people across the UK, will raise the basic hourly rate for store workers from £11.02 per hour to £12.02.It will also increase the pay of workers within the M25 to £13.15 per hour, from a current rate of £11.95 for those in inner London and £11.75 for those in outer London.Tesco UK chief executive Matthew Barnes said:This represents another significant investment in our colleagues, building on the last two years of investment.We recognise the amazing work our colleagues do every day in serving our customers and we’re really proud to offer such competitive rates of pay alongside a great range of exclusive colleague benefits.It comes days after rival Asda said it will increase its basic rate of staff pay to £12.04 per hour later this year.Mike Lynch, the British businessman accused of a multibillion-dollar fraud over the sale of his software company to Hewlett Packard, has settled a legal fight with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) days before he is due to go on trial in the US.A spokesman for Mr Lynch said he had reached a settlement with the SFO. Mr Lynch took the fraud office to court last month in an effort to force it to hand over correspondence with US authorities, information that he believes could help his upcoming US criminal defence.Details of the settlement are confidential. Mr Lynch has been charged with fraud over the sale of the former FTSE 100 software company Autonomy in 2011 and denies the allegations. His trial is scheduled to start on March 18.A Silicon Valley giant whose processors are widely used in personal computers and data centres has hit a US government roadblock in its efforts to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market, as Washington cracks down on the export of advanced technologies to BeijingAccording to a Bloomberg report, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tried to get the US Commerce Department’s go-ahead.However, officials said it must obtain a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security as the chip was too powerful despite being weaker than what the company sells outside China, and has been designed to meet US export restrictions, the report said.The Telegraph has approached AMD and the Commerce Department for comment.AMD shares are down 2.12pc today as investors feared that the reported development could hamper its efforts to catch up with AI front-runner Nvidia, whose semiconductors have captured more than 80pc of the market for the advanced chips.Apple shares have fallen to their lowest level for five months after figures showed its sales in China were slumping amid the resurgent fortunes of rival Huawei, writes James Titcomb:Counterpoint Research said sales of the iPhone had fallen by 24pc during the first six weeks of 2024. It meant that Apple fell from the country’s second biggest smartphone maker a year ago to fourth.Apple shares fell by more than 2.5pc in early trading in New York and have now dropped to their lowest level since late October. So far this year shares have fallen 8pc amid growing concern about its Chinese business.Huawei’s smartphone division had been hit by US sanctions but breakthroughs in chip design mean sales have climbed 64pc in the last year.Thousands of users have reported difficulty accessing Faceboook this afternoon.According to the website Downdetector, over 90,000 people after 3pm have said they are experiencing an outage.

It has already fallen to 10pc from January.Jeremy Hunt has decided to cut NI after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.Government sources said the average worker would save £450 as a result of the latest cut to NI. Use our calculator, below, to see how much you’ll save both from this cut, and the previous one that took effect in January this year.Use our tool to work out how much Jeremy Hunt’s reduction will benefit you.Elon Musk has condemned “dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth” after Tesla was forced to halt production at its Berlin gigafactory following a suspected arson which Far-left German protesters have claimed credit for.These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals. Stopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2024Rupert Murdoch is taking TalkTV off air to staunch heavy losses, weeks after Piers Morgan’s show retreated to YouTube.Our reporter James Warrington has the details:Mr Murdoch’s News UK has confirmed that TalkTV will shut down its terrestrial channel, and will move to streaming-only from early summer. It comes after it struggled to attract audiences and was eclipsed by fellow opinion-led upstart broadcaster GB News.In a memo to staff seen by The Telegraph, Scott Taunton, News UK’s head of broadcasting, said: “We now need to focus our investment on where the eyeballs are and where the revenues are in growth.“In order to be successful, we need to prioritise being where the audiences are, rather than asking them to come to find us down the channel guide.”Read what else is behind the move.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the tax burden will still hit record levels in the coming years, even if the Chancellor cuts 2p from National Insurance in his Budget on Wednesday:The Chancellor will reportedly announce a 2p cut to National Insurance contributions in tomorrow's Budget.  Based on forecasts from last autumn, that tax cut would not – by itself – be enough to prevent taxes as a share of GDP from rising to record levels in 2028-29. pic.twitter.com/NQLqdl3aAr— Institute for Fiscal Studies (@TheIFS) March 5, 2024The pound traded listlessly as currency markets remained sluggish, with sterling traders looking towards the Budget as a potential catalyst.Sterling was last down 0.1pc at $1.26, sticking to the $1.28 to $1.25 range it has traded in since November. The euro was also little changed against the pound at 85p.The main event for investors in the UK this week is the Budget in which Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will cut National Insurance by 2p - after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.Joe Tuckey, head of FX analysis at broker Argentex, said:While it is normal for the budget to not induce any real currency volatility, the muscle memory of the Truss/Kwarteng horror show could still create a twitch.If the gilt market (British government bonds) gets a sniff of any tax cut pledge being unworkable, we could see sterling trade nervously.The historic shipyard that built the Titanic is on course to win a contract worth up to £120m to build a new port for the Falkland Islands.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the latest:Harland & Wolff has been chosen as the “preferred bidder” by the Falkland government following a tender process, the Belfast-based company announced on Tuesday.The project will involve building a floating dock, which will be connected to the island by a separately-constructed access road and causeway.On Tuesday, Harland said the contract was subject to final negotiations on pricing and commercial arrangements but could potentially be worth £100-120 million over two years.Read how finalising the deal would be a boost to Harland & Wolff.Oil prices edged lower as China’s target for economic growth this year failed to impress investors.Global benchmark Brent fell 0.2pc towards $82 a barrel after slipping 0.9pc on Monday, while West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.4pc near $78.China’s National People’s Congress received only a lukewarm response from investors after it set its annual growth target at around 5pc, raising expectations for officials to unleash more stimulus as they try to lift confidence in a slowing economy.The nation also set a more ambitious target for reducing the energy needed for economic expansion, or energy intensity, this year.But there was no big package of stimulus for the world’s second largest economy - and top consumer of oil - to help boost markets and reassure worried investors.US retail giant Target has reported a 58pc increase in its fourth-quarter profits as the discounter cut costs, beating Wall Street expectations.Revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with comparable sales — those from stores or digital channels operating at least 12 months — slipped 4.4pc.But that was a smaller decline than the 4.9pc drop in Target’s third quarter and a 5.4pc drop in the second quarter.The Minneapolis retailer offered a cautious outlook for its sales and profits.A cost-cutting campaign helped the retailer’s profits rebound after it was burdened with too much stock in the summer of 2022. The inventory glut forced it to discount heavily — and the effects lingered for a few quarters.US stock indexes dipped in premarket trading as investors await several key events this week, including a congressional appearance from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.The benchmark S&P 500 hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower as investor focus turned to Mr Powell’s testimony on Wednesday and Thursday that could offer more cues on the Fed’s monetary policy path.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: “In this testimony, Powell will likely ask for more patience regarding the timing of the first rate cut, he will probably say that inflation is on the right path but that they don’t want to lower their guard too early.”Traders see a 65.5pc chance of the first rate cut this year arriving in June, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said said on Monday that the Fed is under no urgent pressure to cut interest rates given a “prospering” economy and job market.Ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 had dropped 0.2pc and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.6pc.Regus owner IWG has hinted at the possibility of a US listing as it said a “rapid uptake” of hybrid working has driven the fastest growth in its 35-year history.WeWork rival IWG added a record 867 locations globally in 2023 and managed its highest-ever system-wide revenue of £3.3bn.Bosses said that hybrid working is a long-term shift that is “one of the mega-trends of our time,” adding that companies have ditched city centre offices in favour of suburban locations close to where people live.The company added that it will begin reporting its earnings in dollars in future and hinted at the possibility of switching its stock market listing to the US.It is reviewing the adoption of US GAAP accounting standards and said there would be a “likely announcement regarding the company’s intentions” during the first half of this year.IWG shares have fallen by 5pc today.GB News’s losses have ballooned to £42.4m despite a jump in revenues as the broadcaster spent heavily on high-profile presenters.Luke Barr has the details:The outspoken news channel plunged further into the red in 2023 after losses widened from £30.7m in 2022.Growth in viewing figures led to turnover almost doubling to £6.7m last year, but income remains only a fraction of the channel’s expenses.Losses were fuelled by investment in salaries for high-profile presenters such as Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who joined in January 2023. GB News’s wage bill surged from £12.7m to £21.2m in 2023, newly filed accounts show.Read how the channel has deepened its reliance on billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Marshall.Jeremy Hunt will cut National Insurance by a further two percentage points for 27 million British workers in his Budget tomorrow.The Chancellor will make the reduction, worth about £450 to the average worker, a central pledge of his speech, having opted against a more expensive reduction in income tax. Government sources confirmed the move.Mr Hunt has been scrambling to find room for pre-election giveaways after the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded the amount of space he has for tax cuts.Around 25,000 Greggs workers will share £17.6m in bonuses this month after the high street bakery chain notched up a 27% hike in annual profits.The group’s boss, Roisin Currie, said the staff will be given the bonus in their pay packets at the end of March to recognise their “hard work and effort” over 2023.It comes after Greggs delivered a bumper pre-tax profit of £188.3m for 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops jumped 13.7pc.The new car market recorded its strongest February in 20 years, figures show.Nearly 85,000 new cars were registered last month, an increase of 14pc compared with February 2023, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.That is the highest February total since 2004 when more than 91,000 new cars were registered.February is a low-volume month for sales ahead of the introduction of new number plates on March 1, which sparks a surge in purchases.The SMMT reiterated its plea for “fairer” taxation of electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of Wednesday’s Budget as private uptake continues to struggle.Private buyers accounted for just 18.2pc of new battery electric vehicles registered in the first two months of this year, with the overall 21.3pc increase in demand entirely sustained by fleets due to tax incentives.The SMMT is urging Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to halve VAT on the purchase of new EVs, amend plans to introduce vehicle excise duty for EVs, and reduce VAT on public charging to bring it into line with home charging.The UK’s dominant services sector continued to grow last month in a sign that Britain has “turned a corner” from its recession, according to new data.The influential S&P Global/CIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 53.8 in February, showing private sector businesses expanded for a fourth month in a row, although growth slowed marginally from 54.3 in January.Any reading above 50 indicates growth for the sector, and below means decline.Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:Another solid expansion of business activity across the service sector in February adds to signs that the UK economy has turned a corner after entering a technical recession during the second half of 2023.New business intakes were a particularly bright spot as service providers reported the fastest order book growth since May 2023.Survey respondents cited rising business and consumer spending, linked to improved optimism towards the broader economic outlook.A turnaround in customer demand and the prospect of interest cuts on the horizon helped to boost business optimism across the service economy.The UK construction sector is unlikely to see any serious recovery until after the general election expected later this year, Travis Perkins has said.The seller of construction products said that its customers are waiting to see if a potential new government will announce any support for the sector and where interest rates will go.It said: “A recovery in the UK construction sector is unlikely to gather any momentum before the UK general election is concluded with the group’s customers, large and small, inevitably waiting to see if there is a post-election government stimulus package for the sector and also seeking clarity on the future direction of interest rates.”It comes as the country is widely expected to go to the polls some time this year. The Government has to hold an election before January 28, 2025.Travis Perkins also said that it was planning to possibly exit its French Toolstation business, which has 51 shops across the country.It made a loss of £19m last year, up from £15m the year before, even though sales grew 11pc.Government borrowing costs have eased ahead of the Budget, where the Chancellor is expected to announce a “responsible” set of policies, according to minister Greg Hands today.The yield on 10-year UK gilts have fallen three basis points to 4.08pc and are under greater scrutiny after Liz Truss’ mini-Budget in 2022 caused a crisis in bond markets.Hal Cook, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:Gilt markets have been under pressure for some time, due to the combination of high inflation, increasing interest rates, higher levels of government bond issuance post Covid and the Bank of England selling its gilt holdings back to the market.This has made UK gilts less attractive investments compared to cash and the increased supply has also worked against gilt prices.There has been significant retail investor interest in gilt auctions more recently, highlighted when the demand at HL’s auction was fivefold more than expected last week.So, how events such as the Budget impact prices of gilts is more important than ever to many investors.This, coupled with increased investments into bond funds more generally over the last 12 to 18 months, makes the impact of the upcoming Budget on bond values of interest to a much wider audience than previously.Bond markets across Europe have improved as money markets expect the European Central Bank to leave interest rates at their record highs of 4pc on Thursday.Jeff Bezos has usurped Elon Musk as the world’s richest man with a net worth of $200bn (£158bn) after a surge in the share price of Amazon.Our senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:The Amazon founder, 60, overtook his rival for the first time in three years, with Mr Musk now sitting on a fortune worth $198bn, according to Bloomberg data.The pair’s fortunes are largely tied to their respective holdings in online retail giant Amazon and electric car maker Tesla.Amazon’s shares have climbed 18pc so far this year, valuing the business at more than $1.8 trillion as technology stocks rocket on the back of a wave of optimism about artificial intelligence.At the same time, Tesla’s share price has slipped by 24pc in 2024 as investors grow wary of the level of demand for electric cars. Its stock fell by 7pc on Monday after it announced further price cuts in China in an effort to stimulate demand.See how Amazon and Tesla’s share prices have diverged.Tesla has reportedly been forced to halt production at its German gigafactory after a fire at a nearby pylon which local media speculated was started by environmental activists.Power was knocked out in the area around the electric car maker’s Gruenheide factory near Berlin, although fire crews said the blaze had not spread to the plant itself.Police said the fire brigade was working to put out the fire on the electricity pylon, which is in a nearby field.A police spokesman said they could not comment on a report by the BZ newspaper which said that the fire was started by environmental activists and that bomb disposal units were called in after emergency services found a sign saying “ordnance buried here”.It was also reported by BZ that the fire had brought car production to a halt at the plant.Tesla’s aims to expand its plant, which has a capacity of around 500,000 cars a year, but it has faced opposition from environmental campaigners and local residents, who voted down a motion to fell trees to pave the way for the factory’s growth.Tesla has been contacted for comment.There is just one day to go until Jeremy Hunt unveils his next plans for the economy in his Budget.A Government minister has said today that a responsible budget would involve a “balance” between giving people “a bit of a tax break this year” and “still keeping a record amount of funding into public services”.Greg Hands asked that people “judge us on our record” as he declined to say whether cuts to public services would follow the Chancellor’s upcoming announcement.Asked whether there would be a reduction in funding, the trade minister told Sky News:Judge us on our record so far. It’s not for me to reveal today what might be in the Budget tomorrow but I would say there’s record numbers of police officers, record numbers of doctors, record numbers of nurses.”I think a responsible budget will be making sure the country and economy continues to recover from the pandemic, from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the spike in inflation that we’ve had to deal with, and I think that means continuing to put record amount of funding into public services while still giving the British people, I think, a bit of a tax break this year as well.Google’s head of Israel was accused by an employee of overseeing technology that is “powering genocide” as he was interrupted during a speech at a conference.Barak Regev, the managing director of Google Israel, stopped speaking as a man identifying himself as a cloud engineer for the US tech giant stood up and criticised its Project Nimbus cloud computing work for the Israeli government and its military.Announced April 2021, the Israeli Finance Ministry said the $1.2bn project is to provide “the government, the defense establishment, and others with an all-encompassing cloud solution.”Critics have argued the technology allows Israel to collect unlawful data on Palestinians and to increase surveillance.Video shared on social media shows Mr Regev addressing the MindTheTech conference in New York before a man stands up and identifies himself as a Google cloud software engineer.Watch what he shouts below:A Google Cloud engineer just interrupted Google Israel managing director Barak Regev at Israeli tech industry conference MindTheTech this morning in NY.""I refuse to build technology that powers genocide!"" he yelled, referring to Google's Project Nimbus contract pic.twitter.com/vM9mMFlJRS— Caroline Haskins (@car0linehaskins) March 4, 2024Britain’s blue-chip stock index fell to a near-three week low as it was dragged down by Ashtead Group and commodity-linked shares.The FTSE 100 slipped 0.3pc to touch its lowest level since February 16.Shares of commodity majors such as BP, Shell and Glencore fell about a per cent each as oil and metal prices dipped after investors were unimpressed by pledges by China to transform its economy amid stuttering growth since the pandemic.Ashtead dropped 6.7pc and was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 after the British equipment rental firm forecast full-year group rental revenue at the lower end of 11pc-13pc growth range.The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.Shares of Spirent Communications rocketed by 58.7pc after US-based communications equipment firm Viavi Solutions agreed to buy the British company in a deal valued at about £1bn.Inchcape fell 9.3pc to the bottom of the midcap index after the car dealership said it expects “moderated growth” in the short term.The publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has seen its profits tumble by a third after rolling out sweeping job cuts.Our reporter James Warrington has the latest:Reach posted a statutory operating profit of £46.1m in 2023, down more than 35pc on the previous year.This was largely driven by restructuring charges after the company cut around 800 roles as part of a wider cost-cutting drive. Stripping out the impact of the restructuring, profits fell 9pc to £96.5m.The figures cap off a torrid year for the publisher, which is grappling with a sharp downturn in advertising and the impact of social media algorithm changes.Digital advertising revenues tumbled 15pc, which Reach blamed on wider economic uncertainty and a “material reduction in page views” after Facebook deprioritised news content.However, its shares gained 10.1pc in early trading.Stock indexes in London have fallen at the open after investors were unimpressed by China’s 5pc annual growth target for its economy.The internationally-focused FTSE 100 was down 0.3pc to 7,617.01 while the midcap FTSE 250 dropped 0.7pc to 19,227.74.London estate agent Foxtons said the lettings market has “normalised” as fewer tenants battle for each property.The company said it thinks the rental sector will “remain resilient” this year, adding that  more properties have become available to rent.The estate agent revealed a slump in profits as it closed branches and incurred £4.5m of costs as part of its takeover of rival Ludlow Thompson.Pre-tax profits were down 34pc to £7.9m but revenue grew by 5pc to £147.1m in 2023 as mortgages became more affordable.It said sales had outperformed the market amid a recovery in buyer demand levels, with a 31pc increase in the value of homes under offer at the end of February compared to the previous year.British technology testing and security business Spirent will be taken over by Viavi in a £1bn deal in the latest overseas swoop on a UK-listed company.Communications equipment business Viavi will offer 172.5p per share and a special dividend of 2.5p per share as part of the deal, which represents a 61.4pc premium on Spirent’s closing price of 108.4p on Monday.There has been a flurry of merger and acquisition activity of UK companies since the turn of the year, as many businesses are perceived to be undervalued.Last week, US logistics company GXO tabled an official bid for British grocery haulier Wincanton in a takeover battle with French shipping business CMA CGM.Greggs revealed it would pay a final dividend of 46p per share after revealing record profits, taking its total ordinary dividend per share of 62p per share, up 5.1pc from 2022.Charlie Huggins of Wealth Club said:Greggs has enjoyed an excellent year despite the challenging economic environment. Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.There is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.This sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.Key to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless. And it is continually improving the offering.Overall, the future looks bright for Greggs and 2024 should be another year of progress.High street bakery chain Greggs has cheered a record annual performance as it notched up a 27pc hike in full-year profits, but revealed slowing sales growth.The group reported pre-tax profits of £188.3m in 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rose 13.7pc.It saw sales growth slow to 9.4pc in the final three months of the year as there was less contribution from price inflation.The group added that comparable store sales growth slowed further, to 8.2pc in the first nine weeks of 2024.But the company said it was “confident that Greggs can deliver another year of good progress” and remains on track to open between 140 to 160 shops this year after opening a record 220 shops in 2023.Bitcoin’s runaway rally is being driven by investors in Asia.Traders in South Korea, China and other Asian countries are responsible for roughly 70pc of bitcoin trading volumes, much like they were in 2021 when bitcoin last hit such heady highs, according to crypto exchange data from The Block.Asia accounted for $791bn of the $1.17 trillion worth of bitcoin traded in February, with North American investors lagging way behind with $113bn, broadly reflecting a trend seen since November, the data shows.In China, FOMO (the fear of missing out) has gripped many small investors frustrated with an anaemic stock market. On popular messaging app WeChat, searches for “bitcoin” jumped 12-fold in February.Mia Wang, a finance industry employee based in China’s eastern province of Zhejiang, told Reuters:I want to buy some bitcoin at a good price and hold.It has jumped a lot and is expensive now, but I worry it won’t have any correction.Bitcoin’s surge that has taken it close to its record highs could be a bubble, a Wall Street investment bank has warned, as global stock markets also jumped to all-time peaks.JPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.Bitcoin continued its ascent to a fresh two-year peak of $68,828 that put it within spitting distance of an all-time high.There are also signs of wider exuberance across markets, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite all hitting record highs last week - and the Nikkei in Japan surpassing 40,000 for the first time on Monday.Mr Kolanovic said: “Equities have moved up this year, even as bond yields rose and rate cut expectations unwound.“Investors may be assuming that the increase in yields is reflective of economic acceleration, but earnings projections for 2024 are coming down and the market appears too complacent on the cycle.”Bitcoin has gained 50pc this year and most of the rise has come in the last few weeks after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.The so-called spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened the way for new large investors and has reignited enthusiasm and momentum reminiscent of the run up to record levels in 2021.Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com, said:It’s crypto mania 4.0, and I think if we continue to see fairly low bond and rate volatility, it could keep going.There’s definitely something of an irrational behaviour creeping into the market.Thanks for joining me. Bitcoin has surged close to its record high and global stocks are also hitting fresh peaks - but a Wall Street bank is ringing alarm bells about the risk of a bubble.JPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.1) IT chaos and staff exodus threaten Britain’s ability to raise crucial debt | Illegal activity in government bond auctions risks going undetected, a Parliamentary committee has warned2) Jaguar Land Rover owner to split off its cars division in EV shift | Tata Motors prepares for a future built around battery-powered vehicles3) Issa brothers slash investment at petrol station empire in battle to pay down debts | Billionaires roll out ‘controlled reduction’ at EG Group to maximise liquidity4) Non-dom tax raid risks backfiring on Hunt, warns IFS | New rules threaten to drive away super rich and diminish revenues, says think tank5) Ben Marlow: Britain must not bend the knee to China – despite being on the brink of a death spiral | There are less grubby ways to inject life back into our moribund stock marketMost Asian stocks slid as the start of China’s week-long annual session of parliament disappointed investors with its lack of big ticket stimulus plans to prop up the struggling economy.The Chinese government retained last year’s target for economic growth of “around 5pc” for this year, and announced plans to run a budget deficit of 3pc of economic output, down from a revised 3.8pc last year.It also unveiled plans to issue 1 trillion yuan (£109bn) in special ultra-long term treasury bonds, which are not included in the budget.Mainland stocks reversed early losses with the blue-chip CSI 300 up about 0.5pc, amid signs of suspected state-backed buying of some exchange-traded funds.However, that failed to lift other markets in the region with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng deepening earlier declines to 2.7pc.Tokyo’s key Nikkei index closed flat after hitting a fresh record the previous day as chip shares trimmed gains.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was little changed, down 11.60 points to end at 40,097.63, while the broader Topix index climbed 0.5pc, or 13.65 points, to 2,719.93.US shares edged down from their record heights in a quiet Monday on Wall Street.

2024-03-05 19:10:09+00:00,"Federal appeals court throws out lawsuit against Apple, Google, Tesla and other tech giants over alleged child labor in Congo","A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit that sought to hold Apple, Google, Tesla and other major tech companies liable for their alleged use of child labor to mine cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The DC Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous ruling that while the plaintiffs who brought the suit in 2019 had the legal right — known as standing — to bring the case, they had failed to satisfy the legal elements necessary to pursue their claims against the companies.“Purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt through the global supply chain is not ‘participation in a venture’ within the meaning of’ federal anti-trafficking law,” Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote in the court’s ruling.“The plaintiffs have not adequately alleged the Tech Companies participated in a venture because there is no shared enterprise between the Companies and the suppliers who facilitate forced labor,” Rao wrote. “The Tech Companies own no interest in their suppliers. Nor do the Tech Companies share in the suppliers’ profits and risks.”But, Rao noted, “the cobalt suppliers and their subsidiaries actively solicit and force children to work in order to meet the Tech Companies’ growing demand for cobalt.”Cobalt is a major component of lithium-ion batteries found in virtually every rechargeable electronic gadget. Two-thirds of the world’s cobalt comes from Congo.A federal judge in DC had previously thrown the case out. But the group of plaintiffs, which includes former underage miners who were injured in cobalt mining accidents and the guardians of children who were killed while working in cobalt mines, turned to the appeals court in 2021 to revive their suit.The defendants in the case were Apple, Alphabet (which owns Google), Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla.The class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of the plaintiffs by International Rights Advocates, which had claimed that the children were exploited and hurt in mining operations linked to the mining companies Glencore, Umicore and Huayou Cobalt, which the group said supply to either some or all of the defendants. None of those companies were listed as defendants.Michelle Toh contributed to this report.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/federal-appeals-court-throws-lawsuit-191009871.html
2024-03-05 18:27:44+00:00,"UPDATE 3-US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa","(Adds editing attribution)By Jonathan StempelMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show.

Models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time. That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest.Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Cathy Hackl, a futurist, author, and an Apple Vision Pro developer. Deidre Woollard caught up with Hackl for a conversation about spatial computing. They discuss how this technology could change meetings, manufacturing, and remodeling a kitchen, what the beginning of mobile can teach us about this computing revolution, and the difference between the technology and value in the Apple Vision Pro.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about spatial computing. This is all about the Vision Pro. Apple wants us to believe this is the future of how we interact with technology. What's your take?Cathy Hackl: I want to start by saying that I think we need to take a step back, we're going to talk about the hype, of course, but not frame that conversation spatial computing around just one single device, and this is why. Because when you start to think about spatial computing, I think a lot of people are thinking of it in the context of only the Apple Vision Pro or some people might use it interchangeably with the word mixed reality. I am of a different mindset. I don't think that this is the same. Just like the internet is not the same thing as our mobile phone, I don't think special computing is the same as one single device or one single technology.What I mean by that is that spatial computing is an evolving form of computing that is 3D-centric and that uses technologies like AI, computer vision, mixed reality, and other technologies to blend virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world into a human's experience of the physical world. That being said, through spatial computing, we're also allowing technology, computers, robots, devices, hardware to start to navigate the physical world with us. It's a combination of a lot of new technologies and about human-to-human communication, but also human-to-computer interaction and it is not about one single thing.I would even go as far as saying this is a new field of technology and it is as revolutionary as mobile computing has been for all of us. Spatial computing I think people need to take a step back and realize what we're talking about here is the future of computing, the future of how we as humans will interact with technology in new ways, and not just one device or one single technology or even the metaverse and I know we're going to get into that.Deidre Woollard: I have to ask you, have you played with or used the Vision Pro and how does that relate to this overarching theory of spatial computing?Cathy Hackl: Definitely have used the device. I am personally an Apple Vision Pro developer, so I actually had a chance to try the device before many people did. I just couldn't speak about it publicly. Obviously, lots of NDAs and stuff, but now everything's out in the open. I had done things with it before. Obviously, when it came out to the public, I went and bought my personal unit and everything. I've definitely tried the device. I think the device is magical. I think a lot of people, when they first tried the device, they have this ""aha"" moment of awe of seeing technology in a new way in most of the people that I have noticed doing the reviews or doing their demos.I definitely have seen that throughout my career in technology when people try these new technologies. That being said, I think the device, and I've said this before, I think there is $3,500 worth of technology in the device. As of yet, I don't think there's $3,500 worth of value to the regular consumer. There is value there for developers like myself. Maybe for enterprises not yet, but because it's really early. It is a fantastic product. I think it is doing a lot of great things. It is extremely powerful, and another thing I think a lot of people don't realize is how much artificial intelligence is being used in this device. It's a version 1. It is the right product at the right time, to be honest, but it's not a mass-market product yet.Deidre Woollard: I love that you made that distinction between the value of it and the value to consumers. I'm curious, though, since you were a developer on this, how does developing for this vary with other experiences you've had before?Cathy Hackl: This one is a little bit different because, obviously, it's really new hardware that very few people had access to. Even the development process, you have to have a computer that has at least an M2 chip, so M3, M2. I think that in itself prices out maybe some developers from developing for this. If you want to develop using Unity, you have to have a Unity license. There's certain things I think right now that might make it hard for maybe a young kid in their dorm to develop for this. They could still develop using some of the native, let's say AR Kit or some of the native Apple part of the Apple ecosystem. But if you want to develop something really robust, you're going to need certain capabilities. So I would say that.I will say, though, because the device is so amazing and truly blends that physical world and virtual experience together, the possibilities of what we can develop are truly mind-blowing. As a developer, it is both an exciting challenge and an opportunity to start to create experiences that have never been created, that no one's really thought of, and that take full advantage of that value that is in the device, in the technology within the device. I think once we have more developers creating amazing content, we'll get to that point where there is going to be more value for the consumer, for the mass market. We're just not there yet with that part, but that's where the work of someone like myself, it's facial dynamics, comes into play. We need to create this content, we need to push the limits of the hardware and the technology and truly create mind-bending experiences.Deidre Woollard: Fantastic. Well, I'm curious about that because thinking about when the iPhone came out and there was not a lot of development. You had a few cool things you could do, but it was really two years later that ecosystem developed. Do you see a similar timeline happening here?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. This is version 1 and I would say this is like the beginning of mobile. It's really early. First of all, there might be a lot of apps available for the Vision Pro. That doesn't mean that discovering them is easy or that finding them is easy within the Vision Pro ecosystem when you're wearing the device, and that doesn't mean that all these apps are using the full capability of what the device can do in spatial computing. I want to be very clear about that. It is early. We're all testing and learning, even with the companies that I'm already working with, the early adopters. It's about exploring the potential of what this can become. It is about what are the early learnings that you can start to take when you're creating these new apps and new experiences.Because if you look at spatial computing from the perspective that it is the evolution of computing and that it is what comes after mobile computing and you start to think about it's not about just the device, but it's about every surface or the physical world around you becoming a spatial interface, then it starts to get interesting. Another thing I've noticed with the companies I'm working with is that they're also thinking long-term, and I tell them this. When you start to think about an iPhone 16, an iPhone 17, a Vision Pro 2, a Vision Pro 3 and other hardware that the ecosystem is going to throw at us, then it starts to get more interesting. Especially when you start to think about iPhones with more spatial capabilities, more spatial video, maybe some other things you might be able to do with the phone that you couldn't do before, that's where I think the companies and the mass market and more brands are going to be like, OK, so now maybe it's something we should pay attention to.That's when you start to not be only about 400,000 headsets being sold, but about millions or billions of people with these devices at hand that it starts to have these facial capabilities. A lot of us are playing the long game here. That long game is moving really fast, though. So I do have to say that. When people asked me, do I put it at 5-10 years? I can't tell you. I don't think anyone really can tell you. I would have to have a vision into every one of these companies' road maps to truly tell you is it five years from now, is it 10 years from now? I think we'll have to see and there's a lot of different parts that have to fall into place. This is the other part, which I think is interesting and people forget, is spatial computing has four components. It has the hardware, which obviously we as tech business people, we love overindexing on hardware, taking it apart, talking about all this stuff.There's the software. The software is where there's going to be a lot of work that needs to be done to create this content and create value and experiences. The connectivity. When you start to think about all these devices, if everyone's going to end up wearing glasses and all these devices connecting on edge and the types of connectivity we're going to need. Another level of not even 5G, we're going to need to take 6G and whatever comes next. Then there's also the part of the data, all the information that these devices need to operate because they're literally scanning the physical world almost in real time and then all the data they are going to produce. That obviously has a lot of implications. Long answer, but that's what I think right now.Deidre Woollard: [laughs] Well, as someone who invests in data center REITs, I'm like, ""OK, I see something happening here that I'm interested in."" I also want to talk about so many people focus with spatial computing on the consumer aspect like games and videos and things like that, but there are a lot of business applications here, too. I feel like people are ignoring a little bit of that part. But with spatial computing, thinking about for me from the real estate aspect, you have tremendous capability for business, digital twins, building information modeling. Talk to us a little bit about some of the business applications.Cathy Hackl: Yeah. I think that, obviously, a lot of people want to focus on consumer because that's a little bit more exciting to talk about, shopping and all that. But I think from the business perspective, there's already use cases that have astonishing results. I'll give you an example, Lockheed Martin, for example, used the Microsoft HoloLens, which is in essence a special computing device, and they achieved a 93% reduction in costs on the creation of one part of the manufacturing process for the Orion space vehicle. That's a 93% reduction in cost because they use spatial computing. So there's already a few use cases out there that show you that this technology can be extremely powerful. Spatial computing plus AI, you're starting to talk about revolutionizing a lot of different processes, whether it is manufacturing, whether it is real estate.With this technology, you can actually put the device on and show someone in the physical world what that is going to look like, what that building is going to look like, where the exits are going to be. You're going to be able to walk through a virtual building really, not in virtual reality, but in the physical world, seeing everything around you. That to me is extremely powerful. It's also going to allow you to tour a place that you might not be able to go. You can do that in virtual reality, and there's the Zillow app already in the Vision Pro.But right now it's more like 360 photos that you're walking around, so it's not that sense of presence just yet. But when we start to think about that, I think real estate from decorating your house, and Lowe's is already doing that in their Vision Pro with the kitchen. They have a kitchen demo where you can decorate your demo. But actually seeing what something could look like in the physical world I think is really exciting, or understanding from a construction perspective what the physics of the space could do to the design, the physical design of that house.I think there's a lot that's about to be impacted and because of the devices, but because the physical world becomes a spatial interface, the physical world becomes where we see technology. We no longer have to see it in these little rectangles that we carry around with us or on our computers, it starts to be all around us. So I think that that opens up opportunities for real estate, for finance, for education, manufacturing, of course, HR, you name it. Just like mobile computing has impacted most industries, I believe spatial computing as the evolution of computing, of future compute, will impact almost every industry.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to talk a little bit about this co-presence idea because everybody wants a better meeting experience. When Meta first debuted some of the meeting experiences with the guys with the legs, everybody loved to make fun of that. But it seems like we are getting to a place where maybe we're getting closer to that. I was looking at what [Alphabet's] Google is doing with Project Starline, it feels like we're getting closer to actually making these remote meetings feel a little more like we're really together.Cathy Hackl: I will tell you, I had a demo of Project Starline last year at the Code Conference, and I was blown away. You're sitting in front of someone, you're not wearing a device. It's done through AI and cameras and you're seeing someone through a screen, but the screen is showing you a version of them in 3D, and I was so impressed by the fidelity. I could see someone's pores more than I would normally see them in person. I was like, ""Wow, this is crazy."" Or I remember the person I was doing the demo with had an apple and I literally just wanted to grab the apple from them because they moved the apple forward like they were giving me the apple, of course, I couldn't grab it, but those sorts of things. Something that really stuck with me in the presence part was the pores, but also I was wearing this ring, and you could see the detail on the ring. He could see the detail on the ring in such a way that was even better than eyesight. I don't know how to explain it.Deidre Woollard: Wow.Cathy Hackl: The detail was so clear that he said, OK, this could be really powerful, from a presence perspective. Right now, for example, with the Vision Pro, you can use your personas, which is like a 3D representation of you. It's starting to get a little better. The first couple of weeks very uncanny. It's still very uncanny, but it's starting to get a little bit better. I think they're starting to improve that. I think we'll start to get a little bit more high fidelity, let's say, of how we look in these devices. But the idea of presence, I think that's where it starts to get interesting. That's where it starts to also become something of value and of interest to the mass market because one of the most powerful things I've been able to do on my device is look at the video I took during the holidays with my parents. My dad is turning 80 this year. He's getting older. He's very healthy.But I was like, I'm just going to shoot as much as I can on my iPhone so I can have these facial videos of him reading Llama Llama Red Pajama to my kids, stuff like that that's special. When I put the device on and I can see these experiences in 3D, in spatial video, it's powerful. It's powerful and I'm like, is this the future of the family photo? Is this the future of how we might retain some of those memories? So that's where that idea of presence in real time but presence also after the fact I think could be very powerful and could become one of the reasons that someone like my dad might eventually, in a couple of years, get one of these devices. Just like back in the early mobile days, my dad wasn't on Facebook, [laughs] but he got on Facebook because that's where he could see pictures of his grandbabies. I think it's almost similar right now. But that idea of presence, I think, is going to be huge for human communications, both in the personal side but also the business side.Deidre Woollard: Well, you had mentioned AI earlier and I'm curious about how much you think, as spatial computing evolves, how much of it is going to be about co-presence, looking at memories, person-to-person communication versus person-to-AI communication and collaboration? Does this get us deeper into that? Because I feel like we went through the last year of generative AI, and Copilot, things like that. People are getting more integrated with AI. It seems like spatial computing takes that to a whole another level.Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent in the sense that anyone that's working with a ChatGPT, or a Copilot, or Claude, or whatever it is that you're using from that perspective, we're all engaging with it on our phones or our computers. That's where you're engaging with AI. So when you start to look at all these AI companies, they're all looking for that container, what they call a container, of where they're going to put their AI technology, and that comes in the form of hardware. Whether it is the R1 Rabbit that took over CES, whether it's the Humane AI Pin that a lot of people are curious about, whether it's the Vision Pro or whatever OpenAI and Jony Ive decided to create and bring into the world, it's all containers for how we engage with AI. I think that that's where this interesting conversation starts to happen, it's about engaging with technology in new ways.The other part here that is an important part of the conversation, I think a lot of people are not having this conversation or understanding it, is that right now a lot of the generative AI that we're talking about is large language models trained on language. Even when you look at something like Sora or Runway, it's trained on video, but it's video of things that have already happened or photos of things that have already been created or happened. Once you start to have these devices that are scanning the physical world in real time, you start to create what I call large vision models, models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time.That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest. But I see the evolution of what comes after large language models as large vision models. Models that truly start to become world builders, that truly have understanding of the physical world. We're not there yet. I don't want people to get too excited, it's the beginning of it. But these devices are going to start to create these models of the world. They're going to start to understand our world so that we can engage with AI in totally new ways, in ways that are going to feel seamless. There is I think this evolution. I think a lot of people are not understanding what these devices can do when they're reading the physical world around us.Deidre Woollard: I think that's really fascinating because it makes me think of the difference that happened when we had mobile devices and all of a sudden you could see where everybody was, but you're just seeing that point, you're seeing a dot. Now you're seeing all of this information, and the computers are all processing and layering all that information. There seems like so many applications for that.Cathy Hackl: We're accessing that data layer. The data layer is, we can't see it as humans, but there's all this data around us. But once you have these devices that we can use to see through, glasses hopefully, like very nice glasses in the future, and they're reading the data that we can't really see, you start to access this new data layer. That's when I talk about virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world. That's where it starts to get interesting. You start to see all this data, not on your phone and a little pin, but actually in front of you in the way of an annotation, a hologram, or whatever it is that you're going to be accessing. Yeah, it starts to get really interesting really fast, and that's where compute power, processing power, where connectivity at levels we've never seen where edge, cloud, that's where it starts to get interesting when talking about spatial computing in the perspective of AI chips or cloud computing, all these sorts of things that need to be in place for us to be able to truly access that data layer in the physical world.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. It is. I'm just going so many places. You mentioned that you have children, I'm assuming youngish children, and I feel like for young people, their experience of the physical self and the virtual self is much different than for me growing up because they're growing up playing in Fortnite, in Roblox, and they're dressing their avatars, they're thinking about that. As we look to a spatial computing future, it seems like there's a a consciousness that exists in two places. Do you see that kind of thing happening?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. My three kids are all Generation Alpha, and I've been doing a lot of research and work on Generation Alpha. The kids of Millennials being born in 2010 and still being born. So Gen Alpha is in the process of growing up, let's say. I always say this, to them, what happens in the virtual space is equally real. My kids don't make a differentiation between the real world and the virtual world. It's just different parts of the world. It's a spectrum to them. I always say this, if they fight with a friend in Fortnite and they see them at school the next day, they're still going to be mad. [laughs] It doesn't change because it happened in Fortnite.It's still an interpersonal relationship. So these spaces are social spaces. They fluctuate between them, it doesn't make a difference for them. They just flow between them. It's very natural for them. Yeah, that is a difference I think for other mindsets, Millennials and up probably. It's harder for us to wrap our head around, but I see it with them day in and day out. That's when you start to think about special computing and gaming or even fashion. It unlocks a new world of self-expression, it unlocks new opportunities for them to socialize in new ways. For this younger generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha mostly, because Gen Alpha is really who's grown up with this being ubiquitous, it's truly changing the way they interact.Deidre Woollard: Well, I think the fashion question is interesting because I know you've invested in some virtual fashion. Now it's like Fortnite skins and things like that. But it seems like it could go in whole new places and really be valuable to people.Cathy Hackl: Yeah, I think it's about to unlock a new era for fashion and luxury and retail, in the sense that when you start to have a way for you to see fashion in new ways, where I'm going to be able to walk around and if you're wearing your glasses, you're going to be able to see the outfit I want you to see on me, or I might be able to change my outfit depending on if I'm going into this store right now or this office for this meeting. Maybe I'm meeting my friends for coffee, but then I'm going to have a job interview. Virtually, I might be able to change the way I look.I think that there's going to be some interesting things there. You already have, for example, London Fashion Week, a partnership they have with a company called SYKY, who, I'm a big fan of and I'm a holder of their NFT, and we can talk about NFTs for sure. But I'm a member of their community. I think they're starting to unlock fashion in a mixed-reality sense where there's a phygital, I don't like that word too much, but there's a physical expression of fashion and there's a virtual expression of fashion, and those expressions are starting to collide and get closer together.Definitely a lot of the conversations I'm having are with fashion brands that most of them are at the forefront of pushing these technologies. They've experimented with augmented reality in the AR try-ons for a long time and now they're like, ""What comes next? What does this mean?"" If this is already proving to be a way for us to create sales and create engagement with our community, what does this mean when you start to unlock this? Yeah, I think we're about to see fashion and technology coming closer together than they have ever been.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about NFTs as we wrap up because we had the NFT hype, we had the metaverse hype. Now I'm hearing maybe metaverse real estate suddenly is becoming valuable again. So you've been an integral part of all of these movements, now you're looking back on what came before and what is happening now. It feels to me like there's a way that what happened before sets up what happens now. But what are you seeing?Cathy Hackl: There was definitely obviously a lot of hype over a lot of these NFTs, speculative assets. Let's be honest, they were speculative assets. I mean, I got into a lot of these as a speculative asset. I'm not in most of them anymore, to be honest. I've divested myself from that. But I do think it did prime the market and the business world to understand that you can still own virtual things. That there is something that you could own virtually, it's in the code. I think it did change the mindset a little bit in that sense. It was overhyped and everything. When it comes to real estate, I don't know if I would go back and invest in some of the virtual real estate.I don't know if I would personally do that again. It looks interesting. It would have to be a really good value proposition for me to get back in there. We'll have to see. Where I think it starts to get really interesting in that perspective is virtual air rights, and stay with me here for a second. When everything you can see and everything you can hear becomes real estate, then that's where you start to figure out, OK, well, should people be able to own this?Should a company be able to own this? What I see and what I can hear, can they own the space around me? Can they own the space on top of my house? Can they own where I live in the virtual space? So I think that that's where you start to get really interesting conversations as far as who owns the virtual layer that is on top of the physical world that you're able to see through spatial computing. A lot of the conversations around virtual real estate that were had I think are going to be very valid when you start to think about virtual air rights. I can't remember which country it is right now.There's a country in the Caribbean that already has certain laws related to virtual air rights. You own the virtual air on top of your house up until a certain height. I think we're going to start to have these really, it keeps me up at night, doesn't keep most people up, it keeps me up at night because I really start to think about this becomes real estate. It's not just a floating billboard in Times Square that you're seeing, it starts to become everything around you. As I said, exciting for some things, a little nerve-wracking in other senses. So I think some of the conversations around virtual ownership start to become really relevant, and the role of blockchain when it comes to what you might be seeing and if it's real, if it's an authorized thing, it starts to seep into this conversation of the future spatial computing.Deidre Woollard: Wow.

2024-03-05 18:05:29+00:00,"Apple’s iPhone sales plummet 24% in China, while Huawei’s skyrocket 64% as Chinese consumers abandon American tech","In China, consumers are opting to buy domestic products amid increasing tensions with the West, at least when it comes to their smartphones.Apple’s iPhone sales in the world's second largest economy, which are critical to its global revenues, nosedived 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research. But over that same period, China’s tech giant Huawei saw its sales surge 64%. Apple has struggled against “stiff competition” for high-end products from the “resurgent” Chinese competitor, Counterpoint’s senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said of the data in a statement.Since last summer, Huawei has benefitted from the release of its Mate 60 phone series after struggling to source parts for many months due to Western sanctions. The new phone features 47% Chinese-made parts, 18 percentage points higher than the previous model, and is even powered by a Chinese-manufactured chip. The Mate 60 amounts to a major upgrade for many Huawei users, but Apple’s iPhone 15 isn’t quite as enticing among its user base, according to Counterpoint’s Zhang.“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” she said.Increasing competition in the Chinese smartphone market is a big concern for Apple, given the company’s China iPhones sales hit $20.8 billion last year, a sizable chunk of their total phone sales of $69.7 billion. Apple’s Chinese smartphone market share also dropped to 15.7%, from 19% a year ago, making it the fourth most sold phone in China, compared to second in 2023.Apple’s stock took a hit on the news of its sales struggles on Tuesday, sinking over 2.5% by midday. Shares of the big tech giant are now down over 8% year to date after surging 46% in 2023. Weaker-than-forecast iPhone demand, a lack of AI development compared to other Big Tech competitors, the decision to abandon a decade-long bet on EVs, and a $2 billion fine from the European Commission that brought antitrust threats front and center are the main reasons for the weakness.Even Wedbush’s tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted that Wall Street’s fears about Apple’s prospects “resemble a horror show right now,” noting that Chinese smartphone demand is “very sluggish” at the moment.The veteran analyst remains bullish about Apple over the long term, however, due to “pent-up demand” for smartphone upgrades, which should lead to 270 million unit sales for the iPhone 16. Ives also believes Apple will begin to compete with its Big Tech rivals in the AI space after ditching its EV dreams.“Over the last decade we have been through many challenging periods in the Apple story and we handheld investors through these stormy periods just like today,” he wrote. “This is no different and in our view brighter days will be ahead for Apple although right now the China story remains the dark cloud over the name in the near-term.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphone-sales-plummet-24-180529063.html

2024-03-05 17:25:43+00:00,YTD Losers: 3 Tech Stock Laggards That Could Come Roaring Back,"Some stocks have been sitting on the sidelines amid this hot AI-driven market rally. Only time will tell when the market’s gains will broaden and help the year-to-date (YTD) losers; value-focused investors have a lot to love about the “left-behind” cohort. AI works its magic in more than just firms building AI models or GPUs powering them. In this piece, we’ll look at three mostly misunderstood tech stock laggards to buy,Far too many folks are quick to discount or dismiss AI plans entirely. Of course, nobody wants to play from behind when it comes to next-generation technologies, like generative AI. However, it’s much better to play late than not at all.Let’s check out three YTD tech losers I wouldn’t count out yet. Maybe, just maybe, one of them can be the tortoise that eventually overtakes the many hares in the tech scene!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock seems to be rolling down a steep hill at full speed, with shares plunging 7% on Monday’s flat-ish day for broader markets. Year to date, TSLA stock is down almost 25%. That’s a drastic decline in just north of two months. And while electric vehicles (EVs) are the hot tech trend of yesteryear, this sell-off could prove a buying opportunity for those with the pain tolerance to buy the dip.It’s hard to believe, but Tesla stock has shed around 54% of its peak value. As EV sales hit a speedbump, investors should keep their sights on the road ahead, not the rear-view mirror. The company is working hard on advancing its battery tech, self-driving capabilities and Tesla Dojo supercomputer.In the meantime, Dojo and its impressive AI talent alone make Tesla stock worth watching on the way down as other investors begin to view the firm as more of an auto play than an AI company.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was under some serious pressure on Monday, shedding around 3% of its value at the worst part of the trading day before closing off by 2.5%. Year to date, AAPL stock is down around 6%, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 10%.Undoubtedly, Apple got slapped with a stiff fine — close to $2 billion — from the European Union (EU) due to its music-streaming dominance. These anti-trust penalties come amid increased fear that Apple may be behind in the generative AI race.My take?Don’t discount the words of Apple’s legendary CEO, Tim Cook. Investors shouldn’t discount its potential if he’s hinting at generative AI tech on the horizon. Additionally, Apple quietly launched new Macbook Airs with the latest and greatest Apple Silicon: the M3 chip. The company calls it “the world’s best consumer laptop for AI.”Overlook the Macbook Air launch, but I think it’s the start of many AI-driven things for the year.At around $175 per share, Apple stock goes for around 27.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), a pretty reasonable multiple to pay for one of the planet’s most cherished consumer products companies (and underrated AI innovators).Even if Apple’s playing from behind, it’s still very much in the game.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software company with a less-than-ideal start to 2024, with shares down around 9% year to date. The company, which makes software products for developers, is innovating on the AI front to stay ahead in its corner of productivity software.Given the productivity-enhancing powers of generative AI, AI has become a must for Atlassian. Though AI could pave the way for rival firms, I’d argue Atlassian’s wide economic moat may not be so quick to narrow.From incorporating AI-generated summaries to offering a wide range of AI apps on its own marketplace, Atlassian has a world of upselling opportunities as it looks to showcase what AI has to offer at the workplace. The company aims to “accelerate work” with its suite of AI tools. And thus far, I’d say the firm’s done a great job of staying at the forefront of the AI revolution.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Dylan, thank you for having me.Dylan Lewis: We've got a double-stack short squeeze and the inside scoop on the world of hedge funds. But we're going to kick off today talking about a long-awaited car that it appears will never arrive. Asit, after almost a decade of speculation, Apple is apparently abandoning its vehicle efforts. Word out this week that the tech giant will be shifting employees working on its auto ambitions, code-named Project Titan, over to other projects, including those focused on artificial intelligence.Asit Sharma: This comes as little surprise, maybe to some, just because Apple has been working for so many years on this effort, it hasn't been able to come to fruition. So perhaps this writing was there on the wall. But before we get into maybe some of the implications of the not-so-great part of doing this investments for so many years. I just want to say that Apple has so much in terms of engineering talent on hand, so much on its balance sheet, so much time to innovate that it can do Skunk Works projects like this, that for any other business would be existential and just pull off, and that's maybe not necessarily a bad thing.Dylan Lewis: This truly was a Skunk Works project. I'm glad you drop that word there because so much of our understanding of what this project was and even what Apple's ambitions were when it came to the cars, really came by way of following permits, following patents, following acquisitions the company had made and sources that reporters had that were willing to spill a little bit about what was going on. The company itself did not give very much on what was happening behind the scenes and what it was trying to do in automotive, which even in trying to process this information makes it a little hard. Because I think we'd wondered for a while, does the automotive ambitions here mean hardware in the conventional sense? Or is there something else at play, even knowing they're going to be diverting some resources away from that, we're still not really sure.Asit Sharma: I agree. I think most of us thought at the end of the day that Apple was trying to find the next great delivery vehicle, no pun intended, [laughs] or pun intended, for its software services. The car would be a place where you would have access to all of Apple's great software. So in terms of what this was, well, it was R&D, research and development. So much of the time we think of research and development is being innovation or improving products. But it's also tinkering. It's trying to figure out what could be the next thing that gives us access to this wide, wide path of revenue. For Apple, there were some limitations here in that they were trying to develop something in an industry which itself was undergoing so much change. We still don't know today from a consumer perspective, if we want to drive EVs. From an industry perspective, if it should be conventional vehicles, EVs, or hybrid vehicles, are we going autonomous or not? Apple was trying to build a car during a time in which no one really understands what the future is going to be like out on the road and this made it doubly hard. Throw in the idea of maybe having an AI-enriched product that would be superior to anyone else's software where you have Tesla, which has been building a supercomputer and grabbing data from its cars on the roads for many, many years. Trying to compete with this type of technology itself is just another Skunk Works project, I think at the end of the day, Apple called a really good play, which is to exit and say, look, we've got some learning here. We can transfer this to other parts of the business. But this is the best place for us to capitalize on our strengths and because they're so big and so successful, really not going to hurt them. At the end of the day, they'll shuffle some good people around and move on to the next great idea.Dylan Lewis: I think I follow you on that take there, Asit. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if some of the work, some of the investment, the research and development that went into this project winds up showing up somewhere at some point, just maybe not in the way that we would have expected. I was always a little skeptical that it was going to be cars as hardware and felt like we were going to see something more in the software lane. It's not out of the realm of possibility that some of the work that was done here winds up showing up in cars at some point, just maybe in a way we haven't quite thought of before.Asit Sharma: I agree, and in the requests to other parts of the company, when you're in a unit like this, which is out there on your own developing a technology. There is a lot of intellectual reach that goes on. So you request of the chip team, could we design a chip that would do X? You requested the AI team, if I had to train this neural network to take a left turn suddenly here, how would we do this? Not having that technology in-house. So all of these requests that the unit would give to other parts of the company can be expanded upon and put to other uses. So I don't think all of this is wasted effort. Did they lose a lot of time? Sure, Dylan. I can remember, you probably don't, like seven or eight years ago when I was a writer for Motley Fool and you were an editor, you asked me to do a small report on the then-Project Titan, I don't even know if it was called that again. This is how old it is, two or three positions ago, almost a decade ago, I remember you asked me about this. So yeah, it's something that only a few companies around can afford to spend more than 10 years on. But I do think that's still before I move on to the next topic, maybe comes back to that ever-present existential question for Apple, what next after the iPhone and it's not going to be cars, clearly.Dylan Lewis: We're still waiting for Apple's next chapter, it turns out. From cutting-edge tech over to cutting-edge food, shares of Beyond Meat, the plant-based protein maker up huge today and it followed earnings, Asit. But if you look at the earnings results on the surface, not all that impressive. Sales down 8%, company continued to log huge losses. But I think as we tape, shares up 40% and that is due in large part it seems, to the shorts out there that have interest in this company.Asit Sharma: Certainly, Dylan. When I looked this morning, I was surprised to see how high that short interest is, it's something like 38% of shares outstanding are now sold short and it's going to take several days to cover those shares. I think the days to cover is something like eight days. So that shows that there is a phenomenal amount of short pressure there. And perhaps any small good news would cause a reaction like this. The interesting thing, looking at the trail of this short interest is people being negative on Beyond Meat for a while. I went to a free site that shows data for a couple of years and for the last two years, on any given day, the short interest has been 40%-plus. It looks like some short-sellers have ridden this successfully down all the way from, I think like $26 a share down to the previous day's close, let's let's put it that way. So it's been a decent trade if you're a short-seller for a long time and maybe some people got lulled into thinking this just keeps going on until the stock goes to zero.Dylan Lewis: Yeah. I look at Beyond and I say this is clearly a company that has struggled. I think their losses were twice their top line or their operating losses were about twice their top line. So this was a business that was having a very hard time finding its footing, finding the correct pricing for consumers out in the marketplace. I think in reality, I probably agree with a lot of the points that would be in a short thesis for this company. That said, you mentioned, it doesn't take much for a company like this to turn things around or to rise a bit when there's such high short interest in the earnings report that we saw from this business, management said we're expecting gross margins in the mid-teens for 2024. Right now, gross margin's negative 20% in 2023. So that was the news that sent this company flying. I look at short interest in general and when you see mounting bets against the business like this, I have to say over the last couple of years, we have seen this go the wrong way in very high-profile ways for so many investors. I continue to be amazed that investors can be so greedy piling into something that's so heavily shorted.Asit Sharma: I totally agree. The people who are short as of yesterday, I think they're in two camps. One, they know exactly what they're doing. No. 2, they don't know anything about what's they're doing. [laughs] So the first camp is taking a risk. The shares are now down to $6, that this is going to zero. They have an idea that Beyond Meat made a fundamental misreading of the market and the shelf space that they could acquire globally, and that's been their problem. You cite the negative margins and they believe that there's no way this can be turned around. The other camp is following the herd getting in because the narrative's so bad. But just looking at your point here, Dylan, the balance sheet, while it's not great, has shown some improvement in one important area over the last year, inventory has gone down from $236 million to $130 million. When you combine that with what is going on in the statement of cash flows, a cash burn that went from $320 million in operating cash to a burn of $108 million in 2023 year over year. There are some signs there that maybe if gross margin went positive and costs were cut drastically, this company could stick around for a few years. So why do we have short interest still at 38%? It comes back to, I think a key word you just uttered, greedy. There's some greed going on here that's getting punished today.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, and for what it's worth, there are some other big names out there with pretty high short interest getting above that 30% range. You look out there, Novavax, Trupanion, Upstart, Carvana, C3.ai, Lemonade, Plug Power. I'm not making a judgment on whether those are quality businesses, but I do think if you're seeing it creep up like that, that is a sign that it won't take very much for you to go upside down on your short bet.Asit Sharma: I agree. So if you're going to be part of that 30% plus, I beg you, people, read the narrative but also look at the numbers. Just make sure that an unexpected piece of good news doesn't cause you to raise to cover and maybe face a window of eight days to get there.Dylan Lewis: All right, Asit. That story with Beyond was earnings adjacent. We're going to wrap our news rundown with a true focus on company results. Coupang, the leading South Korean e-commerce company, reported this week, shares up 5% after the company posted its best sales growth since 2021. What's driving the company forward?Asit Sharma: Dylan, the company is really benefiting from the investments that it made in its pre-IPO phase when they were fueled by crazy money by a number of investors, so they were able to invest billions into infrastructure in South Korea, which we've talked about on this show, has a really interesting topography. The geography of South Korea is very interesting, so it's really hard to build a logistics business. They went there, they raised some public money, built out a logistics and fulfillment arm, and now between their delivery service, services like Coupang Eats food delivery, and a service which lets small merchants operate like third-party sellers on their platform, much in the way that the Amazons and Shopifys of the world do here in North America, they were really starting to get some traction. Net revenues were up 23% year over year to $6.5 billion in the last three months, and the company made a profit of a billion bucks on that. So we're starting to see some traction in this model. It's not quite optimized yet, and I do think that growth might be lumpy and hit some challenges, but at least the narrative that Bom Kim, who is a really great entrepreneur, brought to the market is starting to play out. Plus, they're expanding into Taiwan, which gives some of the bears on Coupang, some food for thought. This was always seen as a one-shot play in the e-commerce market of South Korea. Coupang's actually retraced a bit from some other geographies has tried to expand into, but it is starting to see a little bit of success in Taiwan, which itself has a great market, so maybe there's a silver lining there for revenue. I really like these numbers, I think that the company has mastered this hard logistics delivery equation in South Korea. They do it profitably and they are investing in some other areas of the business, those are losing money right now. It's just some small bets on things like fintech, but they represent growth areas. Last I wanted to say just in summary here I like that the total active customer count is still rising. It was up in the mid-teens, again, trying to saturate that South Korean market where they've sort of eclipsed competitors. Now, it's their mission to get as much of that market as they can. You do that by growing customers and making sure they're spending a little bit more, which the average spends per active customer is also up about 6%. So just a well-rounded report, and I think the stock is performing accordingly today and probably should be a decent, interesting company for people to research in the coming years, those who are looking for a retail story.Dylan Lewis: Asit, you mentioned the international expansion for them and looking to get into other markets. One of the other ways this company has been looking to grow is through its acquisition of Farfetch, which is more on the luxury side of apparel and retail. They spent around $500 million for that acquisition, and I think at the time it was kind of controversial in terms of its strategic fit and its use of capital. I'm curious, do you feel like we're in a position where we can grade that yet or are we still waiting to really see how that shows up?Asit Sharma: Yeah. I think we are OK to wait. Actually, Bom Kim, the CEO said, look, we just bought Farfetch. We did this because it has $4 billion dollars in gross merchandise volume passing through its platform every year, and that's really what we're after. But he also said it's really too early to talk about it. We think it's going to be a great decision, but we're still looking on how to capitalize this, and I think investors can spot Coupang some time here because their strength is distribution, they've proven that. This was one of the problems with Farfetch. While it really brought a lot of small luxury players together in the market, it could never solve the problem of how to give them the tools for them to sell to a wide audience, and then make money at the same time from the take on the platform, the fees that were charged. Coupang is really good at this, that's a strength of theirs. They just haven't done it in high-fashion mode, like a luxury type of distribution model. So I think letting them tinker around and figure this out is fine, as long as the rest of the business is really firing away as we just walked through and generating a lot of free cash flow, a lot of profits. I'm willing to wait a few quarters to see what they can do with Farfetch.Dylan Lewis: All right. Asit Sharma, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Thanks so much, Dylan. I had a lot of fun.Dylan Lewis: Coming up. Hedge funds control over $5 trillion dollars in assets. What's it like to work for one? Up next, Deidre Woollard talks to Carrie Sun, author of the new memoir, Private Equity, for a look into the power, pain, and privilege in the world of hedge funds. Just a programming note, some of the answers have been trimmed for length and clarity. Enjoy.Deidre Woollard: Well, there's such a mystique around the world that these funds, but in the beginning of the book, you point out that while the average stock hedge fund beat the S&P total return by over 5% in the years 1990-2009, it's been a different story since then. BDS talked about that a lot, but there's still so much money, billions of dollars flowing to these funds. So what is some of the allure of that world?Carrie Sun: I just think the thrill of the possibility of extremely high returns to outperform the market is just so not only is it so American, but I think it gives people so much hope for the future, and I think that possibility itself of just beating the market is just so alluring to many people. As you mentioned, in the last decade and certainly during the 2010s, bull market hedge funds have broadly underperformed routinely. I think that thrill of possibly picking a winning hedge fund and sticking with them through years and compounding those returns is just so exciting for a lot of people. I think also by investing in hedge funds, I think people are investing in a certain type of exclusive access. By that I mean, so if you're investing in hedge funds as an asset class, you are investing in their ability to get themselves in front of company management, CEOs, CFOs, fighting for these corporate meetings that provide more information than say, in financial statements. So you're getting access to the ultimate companies you're investing in. But also many of these funds have investor days, LP conferences, and just to be on the inside to be an LP. Some of these very exclusive high-performing hedge funds that itself is such an elite exclusive clubs such that if you're at an investor day at one of these top exclusive hedge funds, you can meet not only people who hold and invest your money, but you can meet other LPs and just get a lot of connections and access that way. So I think for hedge funds itself, there's the promise of extremely high returns which still happens today. Even though historically, recently, they have been lagging the market. But just also to be a part of this very exciting, secretive club.Deidre Woollard: It's interesting in the book 'cause you go from the analyst side at Fidelity and then you take a break and you go into private equity, so to adjacent, but it seems very separate world. So what really surprised you about that shift?Carrie Sun: It was totally different, and when I was working on the analyst side, I wasn't investment side working in quantitative equities at Fidelity Investments. So and then I worked in the private equity, private funds, hedge fund side for my billionaire boss who is the founder of this large firm. I was more in a support role, but I also definitely did a lot of research for him, and I provided both administrative but also operational and research leverage to him. I think what surprised me was less so much going from the investment side to a support role, but rather just the whole industry going from quantitative investing to more fundamentally driven investing. The difference was just so stark. So at my former job, quantitative in nature, I just sat in front of my computer and I was coding all day. I was analyzing datasets, pulling datasets, cleaning them, trying to get them to work in order to build multifactor models from them for stock selection. It was sitting at my desk, analyzing data, doing a lot of coding, reading research papers, trying to find new factors that might work in quantitative and investing. I could go a week without talking to anybody except my boss for maybe 15 minutes, 30 minutes to just catch up on the work I did throughout the week. In the private equity side, I learned it was much more of a human and high-touch storytelling aspect to investing. That is to say that my phone rang every five minutes. I was also answering the phone on behalf of my boss. But also many people just called me to try to strategize how to get to my boss. So my phone was ringing all the time. I was talking to people all the time and yeah, I was having hundreds of little conversations every day and there's this line in my book about my boss saying he got 7,000 emails a day, and this is in the 2010s.On the quantitative side, my phone pretty much didn't ring. I was dealing with numbers, I was dealing less with people. So I think what that is also showing is that on the quantitative side, the decisions were mostly made. I would say what we were doing was more quantamental, which is a mix of quantitative and fundamental. But the decisions were made mostly by the computer, sometimes with human discretion to override some of those decisions. But ultimately, at the end of the day, there was no sense of urgency to a lot of the investment decisions that were being made. But then on the fundamental side, at the hedge fund, everything was urgent because news happens and then if news happens, you have to update your models for your investments. This was especially urgent during earnings season, for example. You were just always on the clock responding to news. So everything was urgent every minute of every day versus a more, at Fidelity, I really worked 9-5 sometimes six, five days a week. Of course, after that though, overnight, I was letting my models run and I was doing back-tests and simulations. But I really just sat on my desk and did coding for much of the day there. It was a lot more, the pace was just less everything is a fire and urgent and needed to be responded to instantly. So that was the biggest change from moving from one place to another.Deidre Woollard: The pace that you described in the book is certainly, it's brutal. It's hard because part of what you're talking about is access and information. You've got this great line in the book that I love about asymmetric knowledge being asymmetric power. So for the fund that you talk about in the book, so much of that is knowing things ahead of the news cycle. I'm wondering, even in the past decade since your experience, it seems like maybe there's a little more, everything becomes widely known. I don't know if you think that the value of that information has shifted to some extent.Carrie Sun: That's a great question because I think that yes, in general, I'm happy about the democratization of knowledge and financial knowledge and data itself. What I mean by that line, asymmetric knowledge is asymmetric power is, I think, certainly, these massive investment funds, they have ways of getting information and I'll say it's sometimes that can have a certain connotation, but I'll say there are interesting ways to get legal information before all other people. It's all about information, advantage, an edge. So like you say, even though I think the line has been moving about what information is easily obtainable versus more difficult to get, I think what many of these massive funds tried to do is it doesn't matter where the line is. They're going to try to just get right up to the line and get before it. So it really just doesn't matter, the line will and has been moving. But they will always try to be one step ahead of it. I think it's not even just purely in terms of information, but even in processes are ways to get information. I'll give you one tiny example and these examples I think accrue in just the ways you're able to get information. But when I started work at this fund that I write about in my book. So many people there, so I was born in China. I speak Mandarin and I got to the firm and so many people there spoke fluent Mandarin. Just from the looks, they were not of Chinese ancestry or descent. That might seem like a small thing. But if you're in these investor meetings and if you're in these if you're trying to do your due diligence on a company and meeting with management, being able to just have that rapport in a native language could be really helpful. They were, I think, really early to that, such that the people there were more fluent than I was and also reading Chinese.Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

Instead, the stock’s slump has only deepened.Most Read from BloombergOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly?

Investor impatience is growing, with the stock slumping 12% this year, pulling its market value below Microsoft Corp.’s.“Investors found this thing called generative AI that captured their attention last year and it’s taking money away from other tech companies because people want to be in the hottest thing,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “Rightly or wrongly, Apple has to show that it’s still relevant in a world where investors want AI.”Read More: Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong OdysseyApple’s pivot comes as iPhone sales remain sluggish, with sales in China plunging during the first six weeks of this year. Its biggest new product release in years, the Vision Pro headset, is a long way off from contributing to sales growth in any meaningful way.“There’s been a real focus on how Apple hasn’t come out with some killer product in a very long time,” said David Klink, senior analyst of equity research at Huntington National Bank. “Obviously it’s been kind of a hard time for Apple holders to watch Nvidia and whatnot.”Wall Street is becoming more skeptical of the megacap giant. Apple was recently removed from Goldman Sachs’ conviction list and Evercore ISI’s tactical outperform list. The company has the lowest ratio of buy ratings to holds and sells since 2020.Read More: Apple’s iPhone Struggles in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge“Forget the car, what matters most for this stock is the AI strategy launch,” Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote in a note dated March 4. “To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone.”While Apple’s move away from EVs has been broadly welcomed, analysts are looking for the company to release its own generative AI product. Samsung Electronics Co.’s updated Galaxy line of smartphones can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.“Samsung has a generative AI phone right now and is getting a lot of positive buzz about it, and Apple doesn’t yet,” noted Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “Apple doesn’t have some of the current momentum drivers and so it’s lagging a bit, so I think it’ll be a second half story if some of these new products actually get out the door.”Still, for bulls, the company’s potential to capture public imagination with an AI enhancement means that investors should be patient. Melius analysts see new AI services driving users to upgrade their iPhones, kicking off a “supercycle” in 2025.“It’s time for a deep breath,” wrote Melius’s Reitzes, noting that 99% of Apple’s installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices “are never going to switch to Android — so a ‘comeback’ is likely.”And, long-time investors say that being a late mover is nothing new for Apple. Counting them out in the early innings of the AI cycle would be a mistake, according to Robert Conzo, CEO and managing director at The Wealth Alliance LLC.“Apple’s doing what Apple does best — it kind of waits, sits back and then sees how it’s going to position its products to take advantage of the AI craze,” he said.Tech Chart of the DayApple Inc. has erased more than $300 billion in market value since its shares closed at a record in December and has entered a technical correction for the first time since August.

2024-03-05 16:55:49+00:00,What the shakeup in Magnificent 7 stocks means for markets,"Stock market indices have been propped up on the success of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks up until late. As market gains begin to slow, is the aptly named tech stock group likely to become a set of laggards rather a catalyst?BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician Jonathan Krinsky speaks on the bifurcation now evident, namely in Magnificent Seven components like Apple (AAPL).""The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014. So when they ended, neither of them marked any sort of major top,"" Krinsky tells Yahoo Finance. ""We're certainly overdue for maybe a bit of a shakeout. And then within the Nasdaq 100, we are starting to see some dispersion and bifurcation... where last year was pretty much a uniform move higher for the Magnificent Seven. We've now started to see that breakdown...""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]- A rally in big tech has driven the market to record levels, pushing the S&P and the NASDAQ to recent all time highs. But it's not strength that we're seeing here across the board. Some cracks are starting to form in the Magnificent Seven trade. Invesco's QQQ, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 is up just over 8% since the start of the year. Now, compare that to the underperformance that we've seen in Apple stock, which is off here in negative territory since the start of the year.Here to tell us what that might signal ahead, we want to bring in Jonathan Krinsky. He is BTIG's Managing Director and Chief Market Technician. Jonathan, it's great to have you here. So what does this signal? Some sort of shakeout coming. And what do you think that could potentially look like?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So if we take a step back and look at the big picture, obviously, it's been an amazing rally for the NASDAQ in general. We've now gone actually over 300 trading days, consecutive trading days without a down 2.5% day on the NASDAQ 100. That's the third longest streak since 1990.And so you could say that's a bit of complacency. You know, now, on the one hand, it is something you see in strong bull markets. The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014. So when they ended, neither of them marked any sort of major top. But I think the point is that we're certainly overdue for maybe a bit of a shakeout.And then within the NASDAQ 100, we are starting to see some dispersion and bifurcation whereas last year was pretty much a uniform move higher for the Magnificent Seven. We've now started to see that break down. Obviously, Tesla has been the weakest link. But Apple, as you mentioned, down about 10% on the year. And recently, Alphabet or Google has started to roll over and break below its 200-day.So there's some dispersion going on. And then the last point we'd make is, what we noted yesterday to clients was a pretty rare setup in the sense that Apple-- the daily RSI was below 30 yesterday for Apple while the daily RSI for the NASDAQ 100 was above 65. We've actually never seen that since the inception of the QETF in 1999. The closest analog we have was back in late January 2018 when Apple's RSI got below 35 and the Q's RSI was still above 65.That saw Apple have about a 8% drawdown while the Q's-- QQQ was hitting new highs into the end of January. And then that led to that period known as Volmageddon in early February of 2018.- Yeah. I actually used to sit directly across from the office of Jonathan Jacobs, who came up with the NASDAQ 100, which led to the QQQs, of course. And is exactly what you're referencing there. It's really interesting here. One of the things that you put in your note, there have been lots of signals over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either August 2020, tech will blow off or 2018's Volmageddon. What is the largest signal that investors should be paying close attention to right now?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Well, yeah. Again, I mean, you there's been things such as the volatility index has been rising a bit or holding firm with a rising market. That typically signals some sort of inflection point. Again, we mentioned the Apple signal. It's interesting. Breadth has actually been broadening. We've seen a new high for the Russell 2000. We've seen areas like materials and energy and even REITs start to actually act better. So on the one hand, breadth is broadening, which, I think, is encouraging.And that's something that investors have been waiting for a while, especially after last year was so dominant and not broad. So on the one hand, that is a good sign, on the other hand, if you look at some of the momentum indices or momentum strategies where it's simply buying stocks that have been going up, and generally, we are proponents of buying momentum.But when it gets to an extreme and buying just begets momentum and you get some of these very extreme readings we've been getting, that's when it gets a little bit concerning. Some of the AI semiconductor stocks certainly are exhibiting that. You could even look at some retailers like e.l.f. Beauty or Abercrombie that have just been kind of one way to the upside. So at some point, the rubber band does stretch too far. And I think we're kind of at that point for some of these names.- Jonathan, is this more indicative of more of a short term pullback rather than a top that could be forming over the longer term?JONATHAN KRINSKY: I think so. I mean, if you think about the fact that we just-- earlier this year or late last year broke above that 4,800 level for the S&P 500, that was 2 years in the making. So typically, if you go two years without any progress, you break out from it, you're not talking about a major top at that point.So maybe we do get a pullback and retest that 4,800 level on the S&P, which would probably be an attractive entry point. But yeah. I don't think we're talking about some sort of major top. Obviously, could be wrong there. But again, that broadening of breadth would argue against that. I think it's more just the near-term extended nature in some of the isolated pockets of the market.- Jonathan Krinsky-- BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician. Thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Appreciate it.JONATHAN KRINSKY: Thank you.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/shakeup-magnificent-7-stocks-means-165549896.html
