2024-03-13T07:49:14.000Z,Apple to allow web distribution for iOS apps in latest DMA tweaks,"Apple will allow iOS developers located in the European Union to distribute apps from the web, rather than from its App Store.The option, which it says will be made available to qualifying developers ""later this spring,"" is being offered in response to the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which puts obligations on how Apple can operate the App Store and iOS, which are designated as ""core platform services"" under the law.""Web Distribution, available in a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website the developer owns and operates,"" it writes. ""Apple will provide access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of developers’ apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more.""Apps offered through Apple's Web Distribution APIs will have to meet Notarization requirements it previously set out -- which it says is necessary to ""protect platform integrity."" They can also only be installed from a website domain the developer has registered with Apple, in App Store Connect.Users of iOS will also need to approve the developer installing apps from their site via their iPhone settings. They will see a ""system sheet"" -- with info developers must submit to Apple for review, including the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots and system age rating.Apple's initial proposal for DMA compliance did not allow web-based distribution for apps. However, it has faced a barrage of outrage from developers decrying a narrow and self-serving interpretation of rules that the bloc's lawmakers intend to open up digital markets locked down by the market power of a handful of intermediating internet ""gatekeepers.""The European Commission has also signaled it's closely watching Apple. It's notable that a few days after terminating the developer account of one of its most trenchant developer critics, Epic Games, Apple backed down and reinstated the account.Apple made a handful of other changes to its DMA compliance offer last week -- reducing certain criteria it had said it would apply to developers seeking to take up DMA entitlements. But today's announcements look more substantial, with Apple also dropping a restriction on alternative app marketplaces that had meant they had to offer a catalog of other developers' apps.Now -- effective immediately -- Apple says alternative app marketplaces can choose to offer only their own apps.In another change Apple has announced today -- that's also effective immediately -- it's dropping a requirement for developers that want to direct users to their own websites to purchase digital goods to use its own design templates for linking out to the web for purchases.It says this template is now optional and developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their own website.In a note to developers about the changes, Apple writes: ""We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.""The changes require developers to accept Apple's new terms -- which means signing up for a revised fee structure that includes a ""core technology"" fee, charged at €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months (regardless of where apps are distributed).Apple argues this fee reflects the value it provides developers, via ""ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users around the world,"" as it puts it.Today's changes mean qualifying iOS developers will soon be able to offer an alternative app store composed of their own wares and distributed from their own website -- something Epic Games has been anticipating -- but Apple is still applying some additional criteria, in addition to requiring developers to sign up to its new T&Cs (and pay the core tech fee).As well as requiring developers to be incorporated, domiciled, and/or registered in the EU (or have a subsidiary legal entity incorporated, domiciled, and or registered in the EU that’s listed in App Store Connect), Apple's criteria for eligibility for web distribution requires them to have been what it calls ""a member of good standing"" in its developer program for two continuous years or more and to have an app that had more than 1 million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.It also stipulates developers must agree to a range of behavioral pledges, including committing to being responsive to communications from it, especially regarding ""any fraudulent, malicious, or illegal behavior, or anything else that Apple believes impacts the safety, security, or privacy of users""; publishing transparent data collection policies and offering users control over how their data is collected and used; following applicable laws of the jurisdictions where they operate (Apple gives the examples of the EU's Digital Services Act [DSA], General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]), and consumer protection laws); and being responsible for handling governmental and other requests to take down listings of apps.Apple's explicit requirement that developers follow other EU laws looks particularly interesting in this context. The bloc's lawmakers can't exactly complain about that condition -- so it offers a route for Apple to police developers' access to web distribution for iOS apps by applying a privacy and consumer rights lens to third parties' businesses.Last year, reports suggested adtech giant Meta was planning to launch its own alternative app store on iOS and distribute apps to users in the EU via Facebook Ads, using the sideloading requirement in the DMA to bypass Apple's App Store. And while Apple's initial DMA compliance proposal looked too narrow to enable such a scenario, under the revised conditions Apple has announced today, Meta's concept of iOS apps distributed via its own ad network looks possible.However, there's one — well, several — big potential sticking point: Meta's compliance with the GDPR, DSA and EU consumer protection law are contested. Indeed, it's been found to have breached the GDPR multiple times since the law started to apply back in 2018, incurring a series of fines and corrective orders since then. Meanwhile, its current attempt to force EU users to consent to tracking is being challenged via GDPR and consumer protection complaints. The EU is also asking questions about the mechanism's compliance with the DSA, in addition to other areas of concern (like child safety).Apple may therefore have plenty of grounds it can point to to deny web distribution to Meta -- or, indeed, to any other business model that's based on consentless surveillance of users and has a long history of run-ins with EU privacy laws.Now the EU is asking questions about Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ consent modelMeta’s ‘consent or pay’ data grab in Europe faces new complaintsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/apple-to-allow-web-distribution-for-ios-apps-in-latest-dma-tweaks/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-allow-distribution-ios-apps-134458447.html
2024-03-12T16:10:01.000Z,How Apple can exit a slump: Analyst,"Three of the Magnificent Seven –– Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA) –– are lagging behind the other four. Apple is the second largest laggard, down 10% year to date. The company has seen four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, weakness in Chinese markets, a hefty EU fine, and a major patent dispute. Analysts have taken note of the tech giant's challenges, with several firms downgrading the stocks or removing them from their buy lists.Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's performance and her optimism about a turnaround.Martin points to Apple's installed base of two billion devices: ""What they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices...Maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth, its a $600 billion a year business and they do $2 billion a year in it. They need to add advertising to get growth back and also advertising has 80% profit margins. They need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Well, three of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks are taking hits so far this year. Shares of Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla are in the red this week. And we are focusing on those three laggards and what it's going to take for some of that momentum to turn.Today, we're talking Apple. Shares are down about 10% since the start of the year. Apple came into the year with some worrisome trends. Four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, with weakness in China weighing on those results. Apple, also facing a legal battle over the blood oxygen sensor in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watch models. Analysts were quick to pick up on the growing problem.Piper Sandler, Barclays, and Redburn Atlantic, all downgrading the stock in the first couple of weeks of the year. Goldman Sachs, removing Apple from its conviction buy list in March. A slew of negative headlines and data has also contributed to the stock's declines this year.From the blood oxygen patent dispute to the company's disappointing Q1 results and guidance, to the reported cancelation of the company's 10-year-old EV project, and a hefty fine from the EU over Apple's App Store practices. Most recently, a Counterpoint Research report showing that China's smartphone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of the year compared to a year ago.So what is it going to take for Apple to turn things around? We want to bring in Laura Martin, Needham senior media and internet analyst. Laura, quite the setup for you. We have laid out what Apple has been looking at over the last several months. What is it going to take, and do you think Apple is going to turn things around?LAURA MARTIN: You know, I do. The most valuable asset they have is an installed base of two billion devices and about a billion and a half unique users worldwide, which because of their enormous price premium on their products, really it's the richest people on Earth. And that's sort of their, I'm going to call it monopoly in an oligopoly industry structure between them and Android.So what they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices. And, like you say, maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth. It's a $600 billion a year business, and they do $2 billion a year in it. So they need to add advertising to get growth back. And also advertising has 80% profit margins, so.And they need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device. But what they have is two billion active devices, daily active devices, which is a really wonderful installed base.BRAD SMITH: And so for the management and how they're going to be able to navigate this year with pulling some of the levers that you just mentioned a moment ago, or at least leaning into some of those opportunities here.There's a lot of focus around the lighter fluid that generative AI could be to smartphone demand and the products in the future. When could that actually be realized for companies like Apple, or even on the other side of that, on an OS perspective, Android products?LAURA MARTIN: Right. So I expect Apple to continue to lag the generative AI companies. So what I think is happening in America is Google, Amazon OpenAI are creating a new basis of competition for all of American business. And Nvidia is the arms dealer in the chips for all of those. So that opportunity of gen AI is unique to a dozen companies. And those will continue to outperform Apple.Apple doesn't have the-- it operates in the smartphone ecosystem, which is a single industry. So that's what it's defending. So it can-- it's going to be limited, in my opinion, to just doing a better job in its wheelhouse, in its barn.Meanwhile, there's a maelstrom going on outside of that, that's a bigger opportunity. So I think Apple continues to outperform the S&P, but it doesn't continue to outperform these companies that are going to redefine competition in America.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-exit-slump-analyst-161001176.html
2024-03-13T09:50:00.000Z,This Trend Could Equal a New Billion Dollar Growth Driver for Apple.,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown revenue and profit into the billions of dollars over the years thanks to its top technology products -- from the Mac to the iPhone. And recently, the company even reached a record number of active installed devices -- more than 2.2 billion -- indicating consumers continue flocking to Apple's products.This could allow Apple to grow revenue yet another way, and this revenue source actually may become the company's next billion-dollar growth driver. The trend has already gotten started. Let's take a closer look.So, what may drive Apple's revenue moving forward? The company's services. From digital content to cloud storage, Apple offers users of its devices plenty of options. And users have signed up, helping the company grow its services revenue to record levels quarter after quarter last year.As you can see in the chart, below, Apple's services revenue has taken off over the past few years, and in the recent quarter reached a new record of more than $23 billion.This is great news because it means Apple's revenue from its devices doesn't stop once the company sells them to customers. Instead, these devices represent a source of recurrent revenue. And the fact that Apple already has an enormous installed base, and continues to increase product sales, suggests this recurrent revenue will keep on growing. On top of this, services are higher margin than products, meaning they are more profitable for the tech giant.Of course, Apple still generates most of its revenue from the sales of its market-leading products. In the latest quarter, product sales totaled more than $96 billion. But services clearly are becoming a key part of Apple's business, and one that could drive growth moving forward.All of this means investors shouldn't worry about this well-established tech company running out of steam. If you're looking for growth, Apple still represents a top long-term buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Kerry for business and strategy updates.Xuefeng Chen(interpreted) Hello, everyone, and welcome to ATRenew's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings conference call. In 2023, ATRenew achieved record-breaking revenues and profits with a continuously strengthened pre-owned supply chain capability and our ongoing increase in brand recognition. Our total revenues reached RMB13 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 31.4%, significantly outpacing the growth rate of the secondhand industry and consumer sector as a whole. I would like to express my gratitude to our colleagues on the frontline and in all departments for their hard work. Our total transaction volume in 2023 was 32.3 million units. We adhere to the strategy of prioritizing self-operated business that provides better services and user experience. This focus has yielded significant results, with our [Wati] transaction volume increasing by 50% year over year in 2023. Regarding third-party platform businesses, we actively adjusted our development strategy and made efforts to develop merchant ecosystem and service capabilities. The overall platform take rate increased by 92 basis points to 5.39% in 2023. The number of registered merchants on PJT Marketplace reached 596,000, a strong growth of 46.2% compared to the previous year, which lays solid foundations for future development. 2023 was also a year of consolidation and efficiency. We further solidified our secondhand supply chain capabilities, providing more valuable services on our platforms. At the same time, we were also more disciplined at the pace of our expansion and investments in new initiatives. At the profit level, we achieved a solid non-GAAP operating profit of RMB252 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit margin of 1.9%, exceeding our target for the year. Those achievements are firmly grounded in our strategic focus. Firstly, we appear to effective customer customer acquisition scenarios on the recycling front; secondly, strengthening robust supply chain capabilities as a foundation; thirdly, driving efficiency improvements through technology; and fourthly, being agile in seizing new traffic opportunities and capturing new customer demand. Now, I will walk you through these four strategic perspectives. First, on the recycling front, we continue to successfully execute our customer acquisition strategy by leveraging our precise recycling scenarios. By the end of 2023, we have presence in 268 cities in China, reaching consumers through 1,819 AHS stores offline. We have constantly enhanced our service accessibility in high-quality business districts and communities. We further penetrated the market by combining offline stores with online platforms. Over the past year, consumer awareness and trust in our AHS Recycle brand have steadily improved, especially in big cities where recycling rates are improving. By leveraging our physical stores, freemium service reputation, and retail partners, we precisely target [using] mainstream recycling scenarios. With competitive prices and higher efficiency, we obtain high-quality sources of free on goods, fortifying the group's supply chain capability in the main business lines. In June 2023, we were pleased to announce the official collaboration with Apple for its recycling and trading services in Mainland China. Our partnership is designed to meet user demand for convenient recycling and low-cost upgrade to brand-new item products. This service is now available at the brand's official website and online flagship stores. Notably, during the fourth quarter, despite flat iPhone sales, this collaboration contributed RMB300 million to our revenues. Additionally, in terms of e-commerce partners, we have solidified our collaboration with JD's mobile and electronics retail departments, offering one-stop, single-device and multi-device trade-in services. This caters to JD's wide user base who seek more cost-effective shopping options and better recycling experiences when operating their gadgets. Overall, the growth recycling value of trade-in business on JD channels doubled in 2023. By expanding our multi-category recycling efforts, we have further strengthened appeal of our second scenario for users. The updated slogan Apple show, recycling more for you, reflects our commitment to expanding into additional categories beyond our core focus on consumer electronics. We are dedicated to fulfilling the growing demand for recycling and cash for high value -- cashback for high-value categories such as luxury goods, gold, and vintage wines. Looking ahead, we aim to expand to lower value item recycling while promoting the recycle and reuse of more idle goods. Building market cap with recycling capabilities primarily involves upgrades of family wealth, upgrading story experiences and IT systems, while fully establishing fulfillment capabilities with professional service providers. Our fulfillment strategies vary with the residual value of goods, with in-store drop-off and doorstep pickup options, users could circulate more used products with ease. By the end of 2023, we have introduced model at recycling services into 262 AHS stores. During the year, the GMV for nine electronic products at the recycling front exceeded RMB1 billion. At the same time, we bring AHS Recycle brand closer to communities and users' daily lives. Our extended presence in communities and commercial areas, coupled with an increasing density of multi-category recycling stores, encourages customers to reuse our services more often. Moving on to our supply chain processing capabilities, our highly efficient supply chain management ensures recycled goods are inspected at a lower cost while achieving accurate grading and pricing results. This allows a consistent and stable supply of goods. We have also improved our operation center's shipping and receiving capacity and enhanced their space utilization efficiency. Furthermore, our main operation centers are equipped with compliant refurbishment capabilities. The annual revenue from our self-operated compliant refurbishment business reached RMB810 million, accounting for 9.4% of the core one fewer second business segment revenue. Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the refurbishment business increased by 41.5% compared with the previous year, while the gross profit margin was 1.6 percentage point higher. This is mainly attributable to our intelligent supply chain system, which enables more accurate identification of devices suitable for refurbishment, resulting in a higher number of devices in various conditions being selected for the project. We actively participated in [taking] advantages to drive industry prosperity. In 2023, as a major drafting party, ATRenew played a key role in establishing the Electronic Product Refurbishment Industry Committee initiated by the Shenzhen Electronics Industry Association. We contributed to various group standards, including general requirement for refurbishment, labeling and information disclosure, quality management, and technical specifications. These standards serve as industry references for intellectual property protection, product data security quality, as well as user rights protection. On distribution, our advantages of an integrated B2C plus B2B platform will further magnified. In 2023, GMV of the core self-operated retail business totaled RMB2.88 billion, leveraging our supply chain strengths. Paipai has trends in its [1P2] consumer retail capabilities, meeting consumer demand for high-quality pre-owned products. To highlight, 1P2 consumer compliant refurbished product sales contributed RMB560 million in revenue. In 2023, we introduced a new consignment model to address the challenges faced by secondhand industry merchants, difficulties in operating to consumer e-commerce stores, and the struggles of small businesses. Through PJT Marketplace, we effectively connect Paipai stores with small- and medium-sized merchants, thus removing barriers that previously hindered small merchants from integrating their supply into our platform. Merchants now only need to lease their products and confirm pricing, while the platform takes care of the store operations, sales, customer services, and after-sales support. This initiative significantly lowered the entry barrier for B2C merchants, enriches the platform supply forces, and ensures a seamless purchasing experience for users. GMV for the consignment business summed up RMB70 million in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the overall business of PJT Marketplace rebounded, primarily due to a recovery in trading activities and the 35.3% year-over-year increase in the number of active merchant users. Additionally, we took the strategic decision to restructure the low commission rate spare stock business, and this reduced our costs and optimized the overall take rate of B2B platform. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, service revenues from PJT Marketplace increased by 14.9% year on year, and the overall take rate rose by 69 basis points to 6.02%. On an annual basis, its overall take rate reached 6.17%, a significant improvement of 189 basis points compared to the 2022 level. We are proud of the proven business model of PJT Marketplace, as it's an indispensable infrastructure of the industry. Looking ahead, we will further open up our supply chain advantages and become a high-quality supplier for pre-owned products in the industry. At the same time, we will provide models suitable for B2C retail and steady supply through online e-commerce platform, live streaming channels, as well as offline mobile phone retail networks and service stations. In an environment where consumers are more cautious with their expenses, ATRenew aims to leverage its competitive pricing and quality assurance of pre-owned products to foster mutual success with our partners. Firstly, in terms of technology and efficiency, we continue to promote the application of automation technology. Firstly, we have enhanced the accuracy of quality inspection. The automated quality inspection system, represented by Matrix 3.0, has reduced losses caused by quality inspection errors by 19% throughout the year. Secondly, with our focus on 1P business, we improved capacity utilization in our automated operation centers in South and East China. Thirdly, through optimizing supply chain management for receiving and delivering goods in different locations, we reduced logistics costs. As a result of these initiatives, our non-GAAP fulfillment expense as a percentage of total revenue has continued its downward trend, reaching 8.5% for the full year 2023, significantly down from 10.9% in 2022. And this underscores our dedication to achieving further cost reduction at scale. In the overseas market, we are delighted to see strong interest in our automated technology for pre-owned consumer electronics. Beyond the Mainland China market, our quality inspection technology has been successfully deployed in Hong Kong and Japan. In November 2023 -- in October 2023, we expanded our global footprint by collaborating with our European partner to bring our one-stop recycling kiosk solution to Sweden. Our one-stop solution effectively addresses the international demand for C2B recycling services. Moving forward, we remain committed to our growth trajectory and will continue to support global circulation of pre-owned products. Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year of 2024, we believe that ATRenew operates in a sustained circular economy that is impervious to economic fluctuations and technological changes. We identified several key trends in the sector. On the recycling front, we see a definite demand for convenient, high-priced, and trustworthy recycling services. On the purchasing end, we see a stronger demand for value-for-money goods from service consumers. On the fulfillment end, we see an unchanging need from secondhand merchants for efficient and hassle-free trading and logistics solutions. In late February this year, President Yi emphasized the promotion of a new round (technical difficulty) As a leading company in this field, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on this upward trend and better facilitate JD and brand owners training programs. Once again, it demonstrates that recycling and trading are encouraged by national policies as a long-term stable industry with high certainty and low policy risks. Going forward, we will adhere to our long-term core strategy and fortify our business foundations. While enhancing brand awareness for AHS Recycle, we aim to address users' fundamental pain points and collaborate with industry partners to explore the untapped potential of high-quality secondhand products. We will maintain patience in the long run while steadily releasing profits and achieving growth. Finally, I am delighted to announce an international accolade. In November 2023, ATRenew was honored as highly commended by the judging panel at the Reuters Global Business Responsibility Award in the circular transition category. This marks a milestone for ATRenew as it is the first time we have stood shoulder to shoulder with global multinational companies such as Oracle, Schneider Electric, and Pepsico. The recognition from Reuters and the expert panel is a testament to our innovation and our technological achievements. Moving forward, we will continue to deepen our commitment to the circular economy, driving sustainable industry development through technological innovation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Rex, for financial updates.Rex ChenOkay. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2023 was a year of significant achievements for our company. Both revenue and operating income saw better-than-expected results. Total net revenue increased by 31.4% to RMB13 billion, and adjusted operating income of 2023 totaled RMB251.7 million, a remarkable 36.5 times the number of 2022. Cash inflow from operating activities was healthy, totaling RMB236 million for the carousel. 2023 was our year of consolidation and efficiency. Moving on to the fourth quarter 2023, we are pleased to announce another profitable quarter, and we recorded another new record non-GAAP operating income on revenues that was, again, exceeded the top end of our guidance. Now, let's take a detailed look at our financials. Please note that all amounts are in RMB, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. In the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased by 29.9% to 3,873.6 million, driven by strong growth in net product revenues and a rebounding service revenues. Net product revenues increased by 31.1% to 3,502.5 million, while net service revenues was 351.1 million, representing an increase of 19.7%. Closing net product revenues was primarily driven by an increased U.S. sales of preowned consumer electronics through both PJT. and paper marketplaces as well as offline channels, of which sales of LinkedIn purposed devices totaled 278.2 million, which increased by 41.5% sequentially. Increasing service revenues was primarily due to the recovery of paper and the PJT. market process with the efficient online and offline customer acquisition and better execution of our take rate of our marketplaces went up 56 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.6% in the fourth quarter 2023. Now, let's discuss our operating expenses to provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operating expenses. We will also discuss our non-GAAP operating expenses, which better reflect how management views our results of operations. So reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and the corresponding Form six K furnished with the SEC. Merchandise costs increased by 32.9% to stand at 115 million. So increase was in line with the growth in product sales. Gross margin at the Group level was 18.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for our 1P business was 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Hey, Justin, you saw soft April 15th services. We implemented a proactive approach to attract customers with aggressive pricing strategies causing gross margin compression. We believe that as our market share within these channels gross So gross profit away, it will gradually return to normal levels. Fulfillment expenses increased by 9.5% to 301.1 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses, we will which we will refer to as SBC from PR. Non-gaap fulfillment expenses increased by 14% to 295.6 million, and the non-GAAP measures to increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and logistical costs as we conducted the motorcycle and the transaction certain activities year-on-year. Non-gaap fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 7.6% from 8.7%. So overall, decreasing retail fulfillment expenses reflects the impact of the economies of scale and efficiency improvements through automated operations, specifically has a number of onetime orders grow. So average fulfillment cost of product was reduced. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 46.6% to 317 million, while excluding SBC expenses and amortization and the impairment loss of goodwill and the intangible assets. Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses increased by 11 points, 11.0% to 246.6 million, primarily due to an increase in the expenses related to marketing activities. Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 6.4% from 7.5%. General and administrative expenses decreased by 18.8% to 62.2 million. Excluding SBC expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses decreased by 17.4% to 45.2 million primarily due to a decrease in headquarter profit, office expenses and fees related to professional services. Non-GAAP G&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.2% from 1.8%. Technology and content expenses increased by 17.1% to 63.8 million, excluding SBC expenses and amortization and impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets, Non-GAAP technology and content expenses increased by 52.6% to 58.3 million. So the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs in connection with the upgrades of the complex operating center and the systems. Non-gaap technology and content expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.5% from 1.3%. As a result, our non-GAAP operating income was 81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 23, representing a significant increase of 135.8% year-on-year. Non-gaap operating profit margin was 2.1% compared to 1.2% in 4Q 2022. To provide some context regarding our balance sheet our inventories amounted to 1 billion as at the end of the fourth quarter of 20 industry, representing a sequential increase of EUR344.8 million compared to we see end of the third quarter of 20, the industry. This increase was primarily due to a surge in recycling volume generated from Apple's official trading program. However, that had a limited impact on our operating cash flow since we have our payment term of 45 days and effectively managing relevant payables through bank guarantees. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and funds receivable from sort of partly payment of service providers totaled 2.9 billion. Our strong cash position safeguards our company's history, we will put we repurchased of four 4.5 million ADSs in the open market for a total consideration of USD8.1 million at December 31st contains three. We had repurchased a total of 18.4 million ADSs for USD56.5 million under our share repurchase programs. Today, we are delighted delighted to announce a new share buyback program. So that allows us to repurchase up to $20 million worth of our shares over the next 12 months is based on our confidence in our value creation, finish growth momentum and strong cash flow. Now turning to the business outlook. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues to be between 3,550 million and three some of 650 million, representing an increase of 23.6% to 27.1% year over year.

I mean, if you step back and essentially Sundar permit on that. Well, thank you for your question. During 2022 and 2023, we saw a shift in consumer behavior. Our users' focus transition from consumption upgrades to emphasize on value for money during this transformation, we noticed a shift right fleet, the right user demand for trillions and recycling in exchange for cash. As we mentioned, our 1Q revenue grew 34.4% year-over-year in 2023 was trade is still clearly more than doubling compared to the previous year. We will continue to drive the core growth flywheel of 1T Rocephin business and to extend our industrial operating profit margin further by bringing our operational efficiency to the next level, we are steadfast in investing in the brand of interest to recycle to unleash growth of traffic and economy of scale. Further, in terms of our platform business, we've strengthened the synergies between TJC. marketplace and other marketplaces that and provide a small merchants with upgraded consignments services.

We set a model take rate for this business segment in 2003, we trust there is ample growth potential in the take rate in 2024, our focus is enhancing user awareness of a transfer cycle as the leading national recycling brands, our core strategy is to fail to build an even better user experience. To achieve this, we will provide more structured products into our platform and improve our pricing capabilities. This will drive more recycling transactions across a wider range of categories.OperatorJunyun Chen, CITIC.Junyun ChenThank you, Kim, and thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good results. I have two questions. First, could you provide more color on the higher than expected profitability this year? And what's your profitability target for 2024 and for the medium to long term? And second in late 2023 and already 2020 for the iPhone 15 series of face some challenges from Huawei. How does management view the challenging commodity landscape, a more optimal biopharma manufacturers? And how did your Apollo trading business performed in Q4 2023? And what are your scale and profit targets for 2024?Xuefeng ChenThanks to our very own joint venture into cancer going tangential, Akiva goes to constitute a degree or two below tied to that yet, will that Lynch the differentiation of 19,000 tons to Teradata as Danielle, you entitled to any of the different science to address us from you if you don't have to constantly review the GE crush at semaglutide and you haven't seen a change going forward on our own to the iPhone short-selling attack or amateur Trulia 20 Jasmine tornado milling unit to show you how it began. Glad to have one-time Google to come back in financial challenges and are going to be our peak quarter to one point. Joe, quick question on your sensitivity to gas in some. Yes, RCM growth, any growth going or will you move down? Sorry. Okay. Thank you. So I will take your first question and I carry out your with the kiosk. Second, the questions. Okay. So for our first submission in 2023, we once again achieved breakthroughs in terms of cost efficiencies. And then in capital measures, fulfillment, selling and marketing, G&A and other administrative and technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenues for 8.5%, 7.3% and 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. These figures correspond to a year-over-year decrease of 2.4% to 1.6% and 0.1% and 0.6% respectively. In terms of fulfillment, we achieved a remarkable efficiency improvement, our efficient system of production to offer incentives and a centralized self-operated operation stations have further improve our inspection quality and cost conscious skewing effect created by the use of automation. Technology at shopping centers has also had a positive impact. We are now seeing lower costs related to sourcing quoting, especially in the warehouse when compared to our previous approach of using decentralized jointly operated stations, we have also leveraged data to optimize small items deleverage with low cost of ownership. This has driven down shipping and receiving costs of all our operations center expenses in logistics costs decreased by 9% and 8%, respectively. During 2023. This resulted in Yunnan CapEx limited expense of 1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of around 2%. Our total net GAAP selling and marketing expenses in the travel industry was 940 million. This was a year-over-year increase of 7.8%. Also a lot lower than all our revenue growth rate over the same period this was mainly driven by HR efficiency improvements from deploying advanced digital CRM tools of the P2P sales team. The results was a 19% cost reduction compared to the pervious year 1423, Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, 190 million, a year-over-year increase of 21.9%. This was mainly due to office grant and various other administrative costs, including employee travel, training and benefits. Our Non-GAAP technology and content expenses were 170 million in 2023, thanks to the gradual maturation of our platforms at a margin. That's our official launch of our South China automation of incentive. We did not see significant cost growth in this category. In addition, as I call them, maturation initiative we launched in 2022 was completed in 2023. This contributed to an overall decrease in technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenue, representing an improvement in scaling effects. So Brooks, some breakdown above highlights the enhancements satellite to the increasing our non-GAAP operating profit in terms of industry for path to profitability growth, our primary focus of our 1P, gross margin and operating efficiency. Our long-term goal is to improve our non-GAAP operating profit margin by 1% every year. In terms of our 1P business, we have prioritized ability to control first hand supply while also enhancing user awareness of our C2B Brent, a virtuous cycle. We saw the first hand suppliers with competitor. We're recycling prices. Meanwhile, we continue to unleash our self-operated and refurbishment businesses. While we diversify the standard of supply to pipeline, we expect a larger proportion of 2C sales as we seek a higher profit margin of 1P revenue. I'd like I'd also like to add more color on our corporate collaboration with Apple. In the fourth quarter, our Apple business achieved sales of 300 million. However, as this business is relatively new and is still being defined as gross profit margins below an ideal level. Going forward, we plan to optimize our pricing mechanism to strike a balance between profitability and growth. In terms of operating efficiency, we are constantly optimizing our full cost to revenue ratios. Our automation capabilities will continue to improve our fulfillment efficiency, especially cost per device was diluted due to an increase in ASPD. In terms of selling and marketing, we tried to maximize the effectiveness of our B2B sales team. At the same time, we plan to strategically leverage social media traffic to attract customers. So probable reserves and location. Data service capabilities of short video platforms such as Boeing, will help us target potential users with greater accuracy. This approach has the added benefit to further strengthen our sourcing demographics and the market position. We recognize that the key to building a successful second hand opinions also lies in our ability to acquire supplies through brand at par. As such, our agents through a cycle brand is pivotal to our long-term driver with government passed at this at this stage, we believe strategically allocating appropriate put the soft resources to social media traffic will solidify our long-term competitive position in this dynamic market.Joyce JuOkay, of Dazzle, and he will elaborate on a pink or the tone cautious on? Well, what you see in other cities such as etsy.com once again, the anomalies of a deal by deal using Yoshida and Okay. So the decency to Shin Ji, the claim of one to four year warrant portfolio was either with our budget. Omega is social media for them. As you also so far, the panel talking now a place of our job for Yahoo. For your laps, the Caisson social elements on Wahler, Panama, ease of use of oil. Can you I would ask digital consumer side and then maybe the timeline shows also finding somebody to go. You can House Counsel has tons of much OpEx.

So that's how we want to push you up taking or plan for you towards the end of the year for you. So sorry, GBM, Central Europe and quite a male in backup center hockey concern, Jacada key measures.Xuefeng ChenI will answer the second question, we have systematically roll down our recycling and trading services on behalf of official website. And that 47 flagship stores for service and pricing were highly commended by users. On social media spontaneously. In terms of scale, we have secured a significant amount of first densify by leveraging the substantial volume of new items shipments in the fourth quarter and by maintaining competitive research and pricing services contributed RMB300 million in product sales revenue during the fourth quarter. This was not this was a meaningful increase compared to the third quarter our suddenly volume is greater than our sales volume. This crude, that user acceptance of ethanol trading for new products is increasing and there is still much room for improvement in the penetration rate of trading products. We will maintain flexible adjustments to our pricing strategy based on market feedback to optimize our gross profit margin. Importantly, we do not handle front-end fulfillment and marketing for the Apple business. As a result, even though this business segment has a narrow gross profit margin, it has the potential to contribute a relatively higher operating profit margin.Joyce JuOkay.OperatorDue to the time limit on the call, I'd like to hand the conference back to management for closing remarks.Jeremy JiThank you all again for joining us today, and a replay of today's call will be available on our IR website, shortly followed by a transcript.

2024-03-13T00:30:00.000Z,Analyst reviews Apple stock price target amid challenges,"They said it was bound to happen.It was Jan. 11, 2024 when software giant Microsoft  (MSFT)  briefly passed Apple  (AAPL)  as the most valuable company in the world.Microsoft's stock closed 0.5% higher, giving it a market valuation of $2.859 trillion.It rose as much as 2% during the session and the company was briefly worth $2.903 trillion. Apple closed 0.3% lower, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.886 trillion.""It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said at the time, according to Reuters.The two tech titans have jostled for top spot over the years and Microsoft was ahead at last check, with a market cap of $3.085 trillion, compared with Apple's value of $2.684 trillion.Analysts noted that Apple had been dealing with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, the company’s main source of revenue.Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and competition from Huawei.Sales in China of Apple's iPhone fell by 24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared with a year earlier, according to research firm Counterpoint, as the company contended with stiff competition from a resurgent Huawei ""while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi,"" said senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang.“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,"" he said.Future Publishing/Getty ImagesCounterpoint said that the first six weeks of 2023 saw abnormally high numbers with significant unit sales being deferred from December 2022 due to production issues.Apple is planning to open its eighth store in Shanghai – and its 47th across China – on March 21.Related: Tech News Now: OpenAI says Musk contract 'never existed', Xiaomi's EV, and moreThe company also plans to expand its research centre in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and open a new lab in southern tech hub Shenzhen later this year, according to the South China Morning Post.Meanwhile, over in Europe, Apple announced changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect last week, Reuters reported on March 12.Beginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.""To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later,"" Apple said on its website, referring to the software platform that runs iPhones and iPads.""Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,"" the company said.Apple has also said it will appeal a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting competition from Spotify  (SPOT)  and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.The company's shares have suffered amid all this upheaval, but some analysts still see good things in Apple's future.Bank of America Securities confirmed its positive stance on Apple, maintaining a buy rating with a steady price target of $225, according to Investing.com.The firm's analysis highlighted Apple's pricing strategy evolution since the introduction of the first iPhone in 2007, with initial prices set at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model.BofA said that Apple has consistently launched new iPhone models, including the Pro/Pro Max versions, to target the premium market.Concurrently, prices for previous models are typically reduced by about $100 with each new release.This strategy, coupled with installment plans from Apple and carriers, has contributed to the iPhone's installed base reaching a record 1.2 billion in 2023, the firm said.More Tech Stocks:Analyst unveils new Facebook stock price target after earningsBillionaire George Soros sold this popular semiconductor stockArk’s Cathie Wood just traded 3 popular tech stocksApple has effectively shifted its sales mix toward higher-value units despite experiencing slower unit sales, BofA said.This trend is expected to persist and could help mitigate potential unit sales weaknesses, particularly in China.BofA also noted Apple's dominance in the high-end market, maintaining a market share of over 90% in the $1,000 and above price band for the past three years.The firm also cited the anticipation of a multi-year iPhone cycle propelled by next-generation AI technology, robust services growth, and the potential for margin expansion.On Monday, Evercore ISI analysts said they believed that the sell-off in the iPhone maker’s shares may be “overdone.”The firm said that investors' growing preference for AI-focused stocks like Nvidia  (NVDA)  has led to a reallocation of funds away from Apple.In addition, Evercore said concerns over weakening demand in China, where Apple may be losing market share in the smartphone segment, have affected investor sentiment.And then ongoing regulatory issues continue to have an impact on investor confidence in the world's second-biggest company.“We think the sell-off is rather overdone, while we suspect there is strong valuation support at current levels to down 10%, there are three distinct drivers that could unlock upside on the stock from here – a) Cap allocation, b) AI inferencing, and c) Risk-off/defensive shift,"" the firm said in a research note.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",Yahoo

2024-03-12T20:06:37.000Z,UPDATE 2-Apple retreats in fight to defend App Store in Europe,"(Adds comment from analyst in paragraph 5)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.Apple announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.The changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.Beginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.""While the App Store won’t be able to be milked as freely, it’s still likely to remain a considerable cash cow for some time as there are strings attached to this peace offering from Apple,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.Developers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.The DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.""To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,"" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.The opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable ""walled garden,"" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.The iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.Apple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.Changes announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.Developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.Under pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.Apple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2.01 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.

2024-03-12T18:00:11.000Z,"'We Don't Want To Think About Apple Being Evil,' Says Y Combinator Founder Paul Graham After Tech Giant Terminates Epic Games Developer Account Over Founder's Critical Tweets","Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.For example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store.  If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.Don't Miss:WealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.New homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market – and it sells for $5 per share.In 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.Trending:Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.The legal battle has continued on several fronts. The European Union recently passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to help level the playing field for people like Epic against Apple. Epic planned to launch a competitor to the App Store, which resulted in Epic Games's developer account being banned. After some challenges under the DMA from the EU, Apple reinstated the account shortly after.While this led to Sweeney touting the battle as ""victory"" on X, it led Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham to comment with a larger question: Is Apple evil?Graham's post stated, ""Apple just terminated Epic’s developer account, and they admitted that this tweet was one of the reasons. We don’t want to think about Apple being evil. It would be so inconvenient. We don’t want to switch to Android. But I see ever more signs that power has corrupted them.""The post in question was from Sweeney stating:Apple leadership faces some massive decisions in the coming weeks as the contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies are reckoned with: the app store monopoly, the digital goods payments monopoly, the tax, the suppression of true information about competing purchasing options, the blocking of competing web browser engines and outright destruction of web apps. It doesn't have to be this way. Apple is a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers and overlord to none.""Many find it concerning that, despite the massive resources Epic Games has at its disposal Apple is still able to assert incredible control over the multibillion-dollar corporation.While corporations increasingly aren't fond of Apple, consumers love the brand.

2024-03-12T16:52:00.000Z,The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans,"For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?While I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.In this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Top DogsAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.We can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.Nvidia: The Undisputed King of AINvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.This dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.Nvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon: Multifaceted Technology EnterpriseAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.Meta Platforms: Always UnderestimatedDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.Under CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.Meta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.Meta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.Microsoft: On the CuspMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.One major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.Microsoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.Something worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.Image Source: TradingViewApple, Alphabet and TeslaThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.Apple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.This seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.As AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.Alphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.Additionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.Alphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry.Image Source: TradingViewSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.Or course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.While major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.Until this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.However, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions.

2024-03-12T15:00:13.000Z,Buffett's Winning Trio: Unveiling The 3 Stocks Driving His Remarkable Returns,"Warren Buffett's investment strategies are widely coveted by investors globally, as the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio has delivered a robust 9.85% compounded annual return over the past 30 years. While Buffett has amassed a majority of his wealth through diversified businesses, his stock investments have also generated billions in passive income alone.Buffett has long advocated long-term investment strategies in established blue chip companies and has typically condoned avoiding taking immense risks.""One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been — and will be — rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes,"" Buffett stated in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s annual shareholder letter.Some of Buffett's profitable investment bets have been in large-cap dividend-paying stocks.Buffett describes his stake in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) as his ""secret sauce,"" as the company's immense dividend payouts account for a sizable portion of Berkshire's earnings.Buffett acquired his stake in American Express for $1.3 billion in 1995, but its annual earnings in 2023 ""considerably exceeded"" the cost of purchase. In addition, his total stake in American Express was valued at roughly $22 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022.Buffett's investment in American Express accounts for 4% to 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net worth, while the total dividend earnings from the stake amounted to nearly $302 million in fiscal 2022. The investment guru predicts American Express's dividend payouts to increase by 16% in 2024.While Buffett did not purchase or sell any shares of American Express in 2023, his ownership stake in the company rose marginally because of Berkshire's share repurchases.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Here are three high-yield investments that could add significant income to your portfolio.The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) is another one of Buffett's hidden gems, as its dividend payouts make a sizable paycheck for one of the world's richest men. Buffett invested a total of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola in 1994 and cashed in $704 million in dividends annually by 2022.""Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays,"" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter. ""We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.""In addition, Berkshire Hathaway's total stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion, reflecting an over 1,800% capital appreciation.Buffett claimed that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is ""a better business than anything we own."" He had a 5.9% stake in Apple as of Dec. 31, 2023, making it one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. The Magnificent Seven stock has grown by over 365% since the end of 2018, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500's returns.However, Buffett sold nearly 1% of his stake in Apple in the last quarter of 2023. While concerns regarding Apple's operational challenges have caused the stock to plummet by more than 12% so far this year, analysts remain bullish regarding the tech giant's long-term growth prospects.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250, reflecting a potential upside of nearly 50%.

2024-03-12T12:30:00.000Z,Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $364 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock,"Given his wide recognition as one of the world's greatest capital allocators, it's no surprise that individual investors love to look at Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's gigantic $364 billion portfolio for stock ideas.Among the top holdings is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up a whopping 43% of the entire portfolio. The Oracle of Omaha first purchased this FAANG stock in early 2016, and since the start of that year to March 8, it has skyrocketed 375%. This is undoubtedly one of Buffett's most lucrative bets.Investors can gain insights by figuring out the factors that led to Apple's prominent place in Berkshire's portfolio.While we can't read Buffett's mind, we know that he appreciates high-quality businesses first and foremost. Apple certainly fit the bill in 2016.A key part of its economic moat is the powerful brand. Apple is a technological and cultural icon, thanks to its incredibly popular hardware devices, the most notable of which is the iPhone. This single product generated $201 billion of sales in fiscal 2023.Look through Berkshire's top holdings, and it's obvious he appreciates strong brands. Coca-Cola and American Express are two large positions whose brands resonate mightily with consumers.Apple's brand holds so much weight that it allows the business to flex its pricing power, another trait Buffett likes to see. People have no problem paying up for expensive products, often just to upgrade to the latest version. Add on Apple's growing services offerings, and the company is able to keep its users engaged and loyal.In fiscal 2015, the year before Buffett scooped up the stock for the first time, Apple reported a gross margin of 39% and an operating margin of 30%. This was and still is a ridiculously profitable enterprise, generating $81 billion of operating cash flow that year.Sound financial performance is something the Oracle of Omaha wants from his businesses. Apple's pristine balance sheet also reduces the risk that the company will ever run into money troubles. That probably explains why Buffett was so comfortable letting the Apple holding become such a huge position in the portfolio.We can't ignore valuation as a critical factor. During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10.6. Investors were worried about something that caused such a depressed valuation. But based on all of its impressive qualities, it was clear that the market got it wrong. With the benefit of hindsight, adding Apple to Berkshire's portfolio eight years ago looked like a no-brainer decision for Buffett.Apple has been a fantastic investment. And because Berkshire still owns a sizable stake, investors probably want to buy the stock right now.But because the shares have performed so extraordinarily well, they aren't cheap anymore. In fact, I believe they are now overvalued. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 26.6 today. That's much higher than what Buffett paid in 2016.If Apple was staring at tremendous growth opportunities in the years ahead, then maybe one could justify paying that steep of a valuation. However, I don't think that's the case anymore. This is a very mature company. Revenue declined 2.8% in fiscal 2023. And Wall Street analysts believe sales will increase at an annual pace of just 4.2% during the next three years.Apple is one of the world's most outstanding businesses. No one will argue with that. But it's no longer a solid investment candidate.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-12T20:06:42.000Z,Apple retreats in fight to defend App Store in Europe,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.Apple announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.The changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.Beginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.""While the App Store won’t be able to be milked as freely, it’s still likely to remain a considerable cash cow for some time as there are strings attached to this peace offering from Apple,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.Developers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.The DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.""To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,"" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.The opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable ""walled garden,"" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.The iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.Apple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.Changes announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.Developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.Under pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.Apple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2.01 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.($1 = 0.9158 euro)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and by Jaspreet Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Mark Potter, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-let-developers-distribute-apps-120249604.html

The law targets the dominance of platforms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s App Store, Amazon.com Inc.’s marketplace and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook in an attempt to improve competition.

Last week it said it would restore a developer account for Epic Games Inc. — allowing the Fortnite maker to build its own EU app store, which could compete with Apple’s own. The reversal came a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker.Read More: Apple Reverses Move to Ban ‘Fortnite’ Maker From the EUThe company was also hit with a €1.8 billion fine in the EU this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. Apple’s appealing the penalty and has said that regulators failed to uncover any “credible evidence of consumer harm.”Apple made other moves to bring the App Store into compliance in the EU this year, including restructuring the fee it charges developers. The company scrapped its 30% commission for a cheaper rate of 17%. Instead, it implemented a 3% processing charge for apps that use Apple’s in-app purchasing system and a 50 cent fee per app install for software that’s downloaded more than 1 million times in a 12-month period.The EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg last week that “the DMA is quite specific, also when it comes to having a fee structure that actually enables people to use these new benefits.”Apple, along with Meta and TikTok, is fighting its designation as a “gatekeeper” in the EU courts.

2024-03-12T07:30:00.000Z,"The year of Spotify? Streaming giant might have outwitted Apple with David vs Goliath play, and you only need to look at their share prices for proof","It’s been a good month for Spotify. While the music streaming giant hasn’t had many of those in recent years, it looks to be righting the ship since layoffs in December as the group celebrated strong earnings and toasted an EU ruling against one of its biggest nemeses: Apple.Last Monday, the European Union slapped Apple with a €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) fine for preventing streaming platforms from informing users of cheaper offers away from the app.As a new EU competition act comes into law, Spotify’s five-year battle with Apple is increasingly looking like a David vs Goliath contest, and a look at the companies’ respective share prices would suggest Apple is wobbling.If you’re an iPhone owner among Spotify’s 236 million subscribers, you might be able to cast your mind back to paying for your first Spotify subscription, thanks mostly to its time-consuming nature.You were likely sitting on your phone ready to sign up, before you were asked to search for Spotify on a browser to make your purchase. You would eventually return to the app to log back in and start listening. Because of Apple’s tight controls, you couldn’t simply sign up there and then in the app.If you’re an Apple Music subscriber, the sign-up process was so simple you’re probably unlikely to recall the routine “double-tap” you used to start paying Apple a subscriptionThis has been the crux of the streamer’s ongoing gripe with Apple.Apple charges large developers a 30% commission on purchases and in-app purchases, including subscriptions, made through the company’s famous iOS platform, while charging some smaller developers a reduced rate.About 85% of developers of free apps don't pay Apple anything because they don't make any revenue from their apps.Spotify has, in turn, limited its iOS app to avoid paying those commission fees. It’s an anti-competitive move that’s affected numerous other content apps, including Audible and Amazon’s Kindle app.Apple said in a press release that Spotify pays the platform nothing. The Guardian pointed out that Spotify does at least pay a nominal $99 annual developer fee to the company.Spotify’s bigger point, though, is that Apple actively deters consumers from buying competitors’ products, which is worsened by the fact that it already runs its own rival service to Spotify, Apple Music.The EU’s investigation excluded the 30% commission charged by Apple in its investigation. However, this charge will go with the introduction of the upcoming Digital Markets Act (DMA).Since Spotify launched its complaint with the EU about these practices, the group hasn’t minced its words in a coordinated lobbying effort stretching across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.Traditionally press-shy CEO Daniel Ek published an op-ed in the Daily Mail last year, in which he claimed the company couldn’t survive if it were founded today, thanks to Apple’s commission rules.Earlier in February, Spotify rented out ads on bus stops across London criticizing Apple’s App Store rules.Apple defended itself by claiming that 85% of app developers pay no fees to distribute through the app store, as free apps don't pay any commission. It argued that developers with paid apps should have to pay to access the App Store’s billions of users.Those arguments are likely little consolation to Spotify, which has been forced to get around that 30% fine.The back and forth presented itself as a David vs Goliath battle between the two tech companies.While Spotify might go toe to toe with Apple in terms of name recognition, it is about a fifth of the size of the tech giant in terms of market value.And despite Spotify also—as Apple points out—sitting atop the music streaming industry, the role of David is one the group appears keen to have played up to.It’s difficult to know how Europe’s move to try and force Apple to open up its App Store will impact Spotify financially, mainly because there is no real comparison to what it means.The group will change its app in Europe following the rollout of the EU’s DMA on March 7, which will make it easier for users to pay in the app and receive in-app promotions.To get a simple idea of how investors think Spotify’s coup might play out, you just need a glance at the streamer’s share price.Spotify made some easy gains in valuation with the brutal culling of 17% of staff before Christmas last year, its biggest-ever round of layoffs as the company sought efficiency gains.But in the month since Spotify released its fourth-quarter earnings, which showed better-than-expected income and subscriber numbers, shares in the company have jumped 10%. Spotify gave up some of its previous gains as markets closed Friday.With earnings data digested, much of this rise is likely attributable to Spotify’s fight with Apple.The streamer is about $10 billion more valuable at the time of writing than it was a month before. Shares rose nearly 3% in one day following the EU’s announcement of a fine on Apple.Meanwhile Apple has lost nearly three times Spotify’s entire market value since the EU’s announcement Monday, losing $140 billion in market cap.“Apple’s ongoing App store rule review in the EU will be an important factor to determine potential future states for pricing,” Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote last month before the EU’s verdict.“Spotify seems to have contemplated alternative pricing models but Apple’s rules appear to have prevented further experimentation on this front.”As Ek put it in a call with investors in February, the future upsides to Spotify’s new pricing models are “quite significant.”There is a 366 million-person gap between the number of monthly listeners on the platform and paid-up subscribers. It’s unclear how much easier access to subscriptions will close that gap, but at least in Europe, Spotify is about to find out.Spotify is also planning to make audiobook purchases in the app and the launch of a superfan platform as new tangible ways of driving income in a post-DMA world.Ek isn’t finished berating Apple, and he is far from satisfied with how the app market is laid out. Following the EU’s ruling, Ek said Apple wants to “close down the internet and make it theirs.”But moves to break up big tech in Europe will likely have ripple effects elsewhere.“As opposed to a couple of decades ago, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, tend to work more in tandem, or at least get inspired by each other,” Emmanuel Legrand, a music industry expert and editor of Creative Industries News, told Fortune.After a turbulent battle for profitability that has rivaled its scrap with Apple, the EU’s announcement could signal a new dawn for Spotify, just as Apple fights its own demise.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/spotify-streaming-giant-might-outwitted-073000149.html

2024-03-11T21:14:49.000Z,AI trade is now strictly 'fundamental': Strategist,"As the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks experience heightened volatility, Schwab Asset Management CEO and Chief Investment Officer Omar Aguilar joins Yahoo Finance Live to provide insight into how investors should navigate their portfolios during this period.Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term.With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: Meta isn't the only megacap seeing some losses. For more on the recent struggles from the Magnificent Seven, and where investors should look to turn to outside of big tech. We want to welcome in Omar Aguilar, Schwab Asset Management CEO, and CIO.Omar, thank you so much for being here. So as we see, what looks like a faltering perhaps of the Mag Seven, as well as a broadening of rallies elsewhere in the market, where do you think investors should be looking? Is it either, or is it both, how do you think about it?OMAR AGUILAR: Well, that's a great question and very timely I think as you were discussing this earlier. The momentum trade has started worldwide when everybody was talking about AI over a year ago. I think that momentum trade started to just be as just a function of excitement, just a function of-- investors getting really excited about the potential.I think as we go in through this year, this has actually shifted from just being just a momentum trade to be a fundamental trade. And if you actually think so earnings, despite the valuation numbers for these Magnificent Seven, has been significantly better than the rest of the market. So they have outperformed over EPS year-over-year growth of 60%. Whereas the rest of the market has actually been on a decline of EPS growth.So when you actually put that together with the fact that they also have had very consistent free cash flow yields, you know, that actually provides a lot of the support. Now, that's the past. The future, basically, expectations required a lot of the discussion that you just had, which is a significant amount of ramp up of CapEx and R&D in order for them to support what the market expects they will deliver in the future.- Omar, is it that the next shoe to drop here? That once these companies report in coming weeks, there's no possible way they can meet up to the expectations that have been priced into their stocks. So that's what investors are doing today selling these positions.OMAR AGUILAR: Well, I think the investors are looking at the relative valuations. They're basically looking at it. It looks a little bit higher now compared to any other big runs in markets.They're still not at the level of what we saw in the late '90s or even in the energy boom that we had afterwards. So still in that context, you know, it's really more about the function of the expectations.Over the next five years is that they will deliver 30% top line growth and 17% on EPS growth, which is very hard to sustain. So investors are questioning whether or not that's actually sustainable. And there are a couple of those seven that are in the process of ramping up that R&D, and that CapEx. That obviously may have a better future going forward.JULIE HYMAN: Omar, I want to ask about CPI tomorrow, right? Because it has seemed in recent weeks that the focus has shifted a little bit away from the Fed, and to earnings, and to the AI theme. Does CPI tomorrow shift the focus back, or does it just depend on what the number shows?OMAR AGUILAR: I think, in general, we should expect more volatility. I think once we got past the earnings season, you know, I think the question becomes the CPI reading is really just going to ask, or give us a little more information of what the reaction function by the Fed might be. And it's really just about the timing where they may actually come up with the first rate cut.And I think investors will continue to look at opportunities to take that volatility, whether it's valuation-driven, or whether it's related to macro to be able to rebalance their portfolio and strategically positioned for the next six months on an environment that will have lower interest rates on the short part of the curve.- If one is worried about the AI trade fizzling out, Omar, what is the best sector they should be looking at right now and make your case?OMAR AGUILAR: Yeah, I think what we have encouraged our clients to do is to-- if you think about the economic cycle as we are today, even with the CPI numbers tomorrow, we have all signed that this is the last phase of the cycle. What that means is that soft landing scenario that the Fed has talked to us is basically now being a reality.And what that means is that the cyclical trade going into the next phase is probably areas that will basically provide good opportunities. And that includes materials, that includes energy, that includes areas that are a little bit more prone to lower interest rates, or at least a shape of the yield curve that is more normal like financials.So I think we're encouraged clients to start looking at that. And we have seen already small caps are incredibly attractive, and the rest of the market outside of just the large mega caps will probably do well.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/ai-trade-now-strictly-fundamental-211449801.html
2024-03-11T20:11:12.000Z,"Apple Stock Has 27% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed the broader market this year, down 10% year to date. Citi analyst Atif Malik rates the stock a buy, but he trimmed his near-term price target over concerns about sluggish iPhone demand in China.Malik's new price target is $220 a share, which still represents an upside over the next 12 months or so of 27% over the current share price of roughly $173.While Wall Street generally operates on a shorter time frame than the average investor, analysts' opinions can be valuable in understanding what is driving the stock's performance in the short term. In this case, the analyst cited weakening smartphone sales in China for the price target cut.Apple is coming off a strong quarter, where iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. However, a recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that weekly smartphone unit sales in China through the first six weeks of 2024 were down 7% year over year. Most notably, iPhone unit sales were down 24%.Weak demand in China doesn't mean Apple is losing its edge. While iPhone revenue in China fell last quarter, it also hit records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific.China is a wildcard for Apple, but the company's growing installed base of devices, which continues to hit record highs, is a better indicator of its global brand strength and where the business is headed over the long term.The stock is still a good investment.

2024-03-11T17:15:00.000Z,"Prediction: This Will Be the Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock by the End of 2024","If you're wondering why the stock market is back at all-time highs, there's one simple explanation: The ""Magnificent Seven.""This is the group of the seven most valuable tech stocks that include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.These stocks delivered monster returns last year, and many of them are off to strong starts in 2024, capitalizing on the AI boom and the recovery coming out of the 2022 bear market. Today, Microsoft is the most valuable Magnificent Seven stock and the most valuable company in the world. However, I think we could see a passing of the torch this year. The company that is set to take Microsoft's place? AI superstar Nvidia, which is already dominating the AI chip market and the stock market narrative.Here are a few of the reasons Nvidia is a good bet to be the most valuable company in the world by the end of the year.It's no secret that Nvidia has ridden the generative AI boom to record returns. Since the start of 2023, the stock is up by more than 500%, topping a $1 trillion market cap before passing $2 trillion earlier this year.Its revenue has tripled and its profit is growing even faster, largely because Nvidia sells the vital components to build out the AI models and applications that almost every major corporation sees is betting on. That tech infrastructure relies on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), and there's been extraordinary demand for them as analysts estimate that the company owns a 98% share of the data center GPU market.It's true that competition is on the way. AMD launched its MI300 generative AI accelerator in December, but the company's first-quarter guidance indicates that its data center revenue will still be a fraction of Nvidia's.Competition entering the market doesn't mean it will make a significant dent in Nvidia's lead as Nvidia has technological and structural advantages over its aspiring rivals. Some industry insiders have predicted as much as well.For example, Matt Wood, a vice president of artificial intelligence products at AmazonWeb Services told The Information, ""There's no meaningful competition"" for Nvidia, and he was skeptical that AMD or anyone else could pose a significant challenge to the AI chip leader.If Nvidia can successfully defend its market share against AMD, Intel, and others, the stock should move even higher.Skeptics believe that Nvidia and other AI stocks are in a bubble, and its bumper profit is temporarily inflated by supply constraints for AI chips. Once that supply crunch is solved, they argue, prices will come down and Nvidia's profit will fall.However, there's no sign that supply imbalance will resolve itself anytime soon.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the recent earnings call, ""We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply,"" and CEO Jensen Huang elaborated, noting that supply is improving, but added, ""We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply.""Huang made another point that's key to understanding the supply demand dynamic in AI chips, saying, ""With all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products.""While competition may fill in supply for less powerful components, demand for cutting-edge technology is likely to continue to be difficult to meet, and that's where Nvidia excels. It should remain the leader in the product category, GPUs, which it invented 25 years ago and has advanced ever since.While Nvidia's near-term success will be determined by its data center business, investors shouldn't forget that the company has the ability to move into new markets such as PC chips, which it announced in January, and it's well positioned to capitalize on evolving markets such as autonomous vehicles and the metaverse.Nvidia's technology has a long history of finding new applications, including digital gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and now AI, but it's a mistake to think that it won't penetrate and dominate new markets as it's done with AI.The PC chip market presents an attractive opportunity for Nvidia, with tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue available, and Nvidia could turn the tables on AMD and Intel there, taking market share from them in PCs rather than ceding it in AI.Nvidia has soared past Wall Street's expectations in each of its past four quarters, showing that analysts continue to underestimate the company's growth and demand for its AI components.Currently, the average analyst expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share of $24.50, but that number is likely to go up, assuming the company's current momentum continues.At that valuation, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 40, making it not much more expensive than Apple or Microsoft, the two companies it's chasing to gain the title of the top Magnificent Seven stock. Microsoft trades at a P/E ratio of 35, based on estimates for its fiscal year that ends in June, and Apple trades at a forward P/E of 26.At a market cap of $2.32 trillion, Nvidia's stock price would have to increase 31% to eclipse Microsoft's current level of $3.04 trillion. That kind of gain looks to be within reach for Nvidia, given its dominance of AI chips and the ongoing supply crunch that should support its wide profit margin.It's no accident that Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in the AI boom. It holds the key to unlocking the power of generative AI, and that seems unlikely to change. As demand grows for AI and the components that make it work, Nvidia should go even higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11T17:09:00.000Z,Alphabet is the bargain stock among the ‘Magnificent Seven’,"You might be tired of seeing so much coverage of the group of tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven, but their valuations and expected growth rates highlight Alphabet — Google’s holding company — as a compelling play at its current price. It even appears to be a bargain when compared with the entire S&P 500.Tesla’s stock chart sends warning to bears that momentum may have bottomedIBM begins layoffs amid push toward AINo more free lunches: How laid-off tech workers are surviving a tight job marketI inherited $70,000 in savings bonds from my late mother.

Here’s the key to that rally.Sorted by market capitalization, the Magnificent Seven include Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Apple Inc. AAPL, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Tesla Inc. TSLA.Combined, these seven companies (eight stocks with Alphabet’s Class A and Class C shares) make up 28.7% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 SPX.The most commonly cited stock valuation is the forward price-to-earnings ratio. This is the current price of a stock divided by the average earnings estimate for the next 12 months among analysts who work for brokerage firms.FactSet tracks forward P/E ratios historically, based on rolling consensus estimates among analysts polled by the data provider.With the Magnificent Seven sorted by market capitalization, here are current forward P/E ratios along with historical averages, with weighted ratios for the S&P 500 at the bottom:CompanyTickerMarket cap ($bil)Forward P/E3-year average forward P/E5-year average forward P/E10-year average forward P/EMicrosoft Corp.MSFT$3,01831.328.828.624.1Apple Inc.AAPL$2,63625.425.924.619.0Nvidia Corp.NVDA$2,18834.141.439.935.0Amazon.com Inc.AMZN$1,82139.457.662.8116.7Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet is among five companies trading below their 10-year averages. But only Alphabet trades below all the averages while having a current forward P/E below that of the index.Now let’s take a look at expected compound annual growth rates for sales and earnings per share through 2025. The estimates driving the expected growth rates are based on calendar years, because Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple have fiscal years that don’t match the calendar.CompanyTickerExpected 2-year sales CAGR through 20252-year estimated EPS CAGR through 2025Microsoft Corp.MSFT14.8%14.8%Apple Inc.AAPL4.1%6.6%Nvidia Corp.NVDA52.3%66.8%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN11.7%36.3%Alphabet Inc.

The point with Alphabet is that it is expected to grow sales and earnings at considerably higher paces than the S&P 500, while its shares trade at a lower valuation than that of the index as a whole.Nvidia has a relatively high P/E of 34.1, but that valuation has come down considerably over the past year. Nvidia tops this list of 25 of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 whose EPS estimates have risen more quickly than the share prices.Related: Nvidia’s stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here’s the key to that rally.Getting back to Alphabet, the stock is down 5% from where it was at the end of 2021. It is useful to look at performance from that date, because the S&P 500 fell 18.2% in 2022, only to rise 26.3% in 2023. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.)So the S&P 500 is up only 3.4% since the end of 2021, while Alphabet is down 5% and Nividia’s stock has tripled in price.On Monday, Michael Nathanson, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a note to clients that Alphabet’s stock had been ”de-rated” relative to the S&P 500, reflecting investors’ concern over artificial intelligence and its possible effect on Google’s search business.He also pointed to a recent misstep, when Google botched the rollout of its Gemini AI tool for generating images.“Ironically, Alphabet’s long-term reluctance to ship AI products that were not yet safe, reliable, and responsible did not compute with what just happened here,” Nathanson wrote.The analyst also cited a ceding of advertising market share to Meta and Amazon “for much of the past decade.”But then he pointed to Meta, another company that had disappointed investors: CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s initial vision of the metaverse didn’t work out very well, and it was followed by a “year of efficiency” for the company in 2023, which helped reverse its share-price slide.Nathanson rates Alphabet’s Class A shares a buy, with a $175 price target, which is 29% higher than the stock’s closing price of $135.41 on Friday.Summing up, the analyst wrote that “the basic question is about Alphabet’s ability to harness their deep pool of world-class engineers and their long-term embrace [of] machine learning to build products thatconsumers want to use.”He concluded: “Judging by past accomplishments, despite current headlines, that seems like a bet that investors should be willing to make akin to buying Meta in the 4th quarter of 2022.”Here’s a summary of ratings and price targets for the Magnificent Seven among analysts polled by FactSet:CompanyTickerShare buy ratingsShare neutral ratingsShare sell ratingsMarch 8 priceConsensus price targetImplied 12-month upside potentialMicrosoft Corp.MSFT95%5%0%$406.22$469.9716%Apple Inc.AAPL58%30%12%$170.73$199.8617%Nvidia Corp.NVDA92%8%0%$875.28$897.213%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN95%5%0%$175.35$208.2219%Alphabet Inc.

2024-03-11T16:06:25.000Z,How Tesla can leverage R&D to stay in the Magnificent 7,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have fallen over 27% year to date, with fellow Magnificent Seven companies Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) also lagging behind the rest of the group. Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy?Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors.Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- Tesla is a Magnificent 7's biggest laggard year to date, but it's not the only one. Shares of Apple and Alphabet are also in the red since the start of the year. Now this week, we are focusing on these three laggards and what it's going to take for the companies to turn things around.Today, the focus is Tesla, currently trading just around 179 bucks a share, a loss of nearly 30% this year alone. Our next guest, though, saying that now could be a good buying opportunity. For more on that and what the catalyst will be, we want to bring in George Gianarikas.He's with Canaccord Genuity as a managing director there. George, it's great to see you. So talk to us about why you think Tesla is a buy at these levels?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, first, let's address the reason why it's lagged. I mean, it's pretty simple. The numbers have come down. I mean, if you look at the earnings revisions for the last 12 plus months, they've been terrible.I mean, I think we started for 2023 somewhere early in that year on $6, and it came all the way down to $3. And I think we're at a period of time right now where the worries likely exceed the reality. And we had some numbers last week come out of China that weren't very good.But people didn't take into account that the new year has been pushed into February. Also, some stuff that happened. In Germany, their plant came down for about a week because of arson, a week plus. And in the US, people are worried about the production of their new Model 3.And we think that the best way to kind of gauge for the most part of what's happening with Tesla, particularly in the US, is to look at their prices. And they've been pretty stable in the US over the last couple few months. So there's a lot of wood to chop still in the quarter. But in the near term, we think that we may have overcorrected here to the downside.- They talked on their most recent earnings call, George, about the spending and some of the record R&D that they had done during 2023, which now places a lot of emphasis on bringing that to fruition in 2024 and years following now. How much of that spending do you anticipate will lean further towards the side of this artificial intelligence narrative that has started to prevail with Tesla, even though we've seen some early slippage this year, at least, in the price action?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, we're in a little bit of a pause period right now for the stock. And the near term wiggles, we think we've overcorrected. But for the stock to really get its legs, we have to have three things happen. First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful.Second, their margins need to go up. And the most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI that they've built, in addition to volumes starting to pick back up. And third, it's continuation in growth, really good growth in their energy storage business.So when you talk about leveraging this R&D that they've spent a lot on, it's two real products that come out of that, the big spending. It's number one, that next generation vehicle, which we think should start production in the second half of 2025 and continued FSD penetration.Now we think that the FSD offering from the company at $12,000 currently is a little too rich, particularly relative to the cost of the vehicle. We think the company should cut the price of that FSD to really increase penetration and really have the margins start to turn in. If you think about it, that offering is about 100% gross margin very, very high gross margin because it's a software upgrade.- George, we have seen, though, the price wars play out, obviously, Tesla far from the only automaker, one of many, I should say, that has been forced to lower the prices, obviously, putting pressure on margins, very similar to what you were just saying. How do you see that more broadly speaking beyond Tesla shaking out just a bit? And that pressure to the downside in terms of boosting demand, how much longer are they going to be forced to prices in order to drive the demand that we simply have not seen?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, look, there's been a pause, like I said, recently. Particularly, in the US, the price declines that we saw for the most part in 2023 is sort of ebbed right now, which for us, is indication that maybe things aren't that bad. And what the company did strategically by being that aggressive is, first of all, they got to sell more vehicles.Right? Because interest rates went up, and most people finance the purchase of their vehicles. So that meant that the prices of vehicles went up artificially. But second, it put a lot of their competitors on their back legs.I mean, margins got a lot worse for some of the pure play EV competitors. Sales got a lot worse for them. And even for the traditional OEMs that try to compete against Tesla, their margins got significantly worse because they couldn't compete with Tesla on price. So what we saw is-- longer term what Tesla did is put a lot of its competition on the back foot, particularly in the United States and Europe.- And so, let's talk then about China because that's one of the larger kind of lingering risks right now for Tesla. Is sentiment shifting so much in the region that there would be a longer term implication for how Tesla is able to operate and sell into China, as well?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: That's a great question. I mean, look, we see the real competition for Tesla long term, like, we really like Rivian in the United States, and in parts of Europe, and other parts of North America. But in China, specifically, there are some very, very good OEM competitors from pure play EV companies.The company has one plant in China right now, able to produce about 950,000 vehicles. And they're running-- despite this monthly volatility, they're running full tilt there. And we'll continue-- we continue to believe they'll run full tilt in that country. So there's really good competition in China, but we think Tesla can operate that factory at relatively full capacity that leaves them in a good place in that country.- So, George, as we wrap this up, we started this segment talking about the share price being under pressure. We're trading around 179 bucks a share today. What more specifically does that upside look like?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, our price target is in the 230s, and we base that on 26 times our 2026 estimates. And we think that's going to happen as volumes start to pick up next year and the year after that based on increased Cybertruck production and the next generation vehicle.And importantly, we think that the margins will start to get better, particularly as we've seen an abatement and price reductions, at least, for now and costs continue to come down for the company. So, in the near term, we have these wiggles. And we think like we said, we've overcorrected to the downside in the near term.But for real outperformance, we need to-- next generation vehicle or some visibility into that increased margins based on FSD mostly and continued growth in their energy storage business. Those three things will really get the stock to get its outperformance legs of old back.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/tesla-leverage-r-d-stay-160625612.html
2024-03-11T15:37:13.000Z,Apple’s hysterics over the new EU antitrust law have led to two climbdowns already—and the law hasn’t even been in force for a week,"European Commission 2–Apple 0.The EU’s Digital Markets Act has been in place for less than five days, and its enforcers have already pushed Apple into two humiliating U-turns. If Apple has been trying to test how much it can throw its weight around in its increasingly hilarious hissy fit over the new Big Tech antitrust law, it’s had its answer now.The first reversal came earlier this month when Apple meekly agreed to let home-screen web apps continue functioning as intended on iPhones. It had previously killed off the entire category on the basis of protecting users’ security under a rather odd reading of the DMA. The Commission threatened an investigation, and Apple retreated.Then, on Friday, Apple agreed to reinstate a developer account for archnemesis Epic Games, effectively allowing it to roll out a third-party iOS app store (an actual DMA demand) and also finally return Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU.Apple’s reason for axing Epic’s account was that Epic had previously violated Apple’s policy by launching an alternative to Apple’s payment system for in-app payments (which is why Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store in 2020). Apple had also argued that Epic’s criticism of Apple’s new EU business model meant it couldn’t be trusted to follow the terms for third-party app stores, even though Epic had promised to abide by them. Apple’s reasoning was doubly ludicrous because a) the Commission wants affected companies to give feedback on Big Tech’s attempts to comply with the DMA, and b) Apple claimed a California court ruling gave it the ability to cancel Epic’s developer accounts anytime it wanted, anywhere in the world.After the Commission again threatened an investigation—and presumably after Apple’s lawyers googled “jurisdiction”—the company again backed down. “I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,” cackled Commission digital chief Thierry Breton in an X post. “From Day 2, [the] DMA is already showing very concrete results!”I think at this point it’s fair to say that Tim Cook’s team has been massively overreaching in its response to the DMA. But hey, nobody ever said compliance with EU tech law was easy.You know who else just learned that lesson? The European Commission.This morning, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)—the privacy regulator that specifically keeps an eye on big EU institutions—slammed the Commission for breaking a 2018 data-protection law in how its staff use Microsoft 365. The watchdog said the Commission had failed to implement safeguards to ensure that people’s personal data is only being sent to countries whose data-protection rules are equivalent to the EU’s. What’s more, the Commission hadn’t been properly specifying what types of personal data would be collected in the use of Microsoft 365, and what the data would be used for, as the law demands. (This isn’t the well-known General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, but rather a special companion law that only applies to the EU institutions.)As a result, the Commission will have to “suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the [EU and European Economic Area]” that lack adequate privacy protections. It’s unclear which countries the watchdog means. The EDPS has given the Commission until early December to comply, reflecting how difficult it will be to comply with the decision without majorly disrupting the Commission’s work.The Commission insists that its use of Microsoft 365 is legally compliant; it’s studying the EDPS order before deciding how to respond. But, it said in a statement, “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the current high level of mobile and integrated IT services. This applies not only to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services.”Fairly or not, I suspect quite a few Silicon Valley regulatory officers will be chuckling at the irony of the situation.

2024-03-11T15:13:36.000Z,Magnificent 7 laggards: Tesla stock slides considerably in 2024,"Five of the Magnificent Seven tech stock components saw stock declines in last week's trading. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre eyes several of the group's biggest laggards, highlighting EV maker Tesla's (TSLA) year-to-date losses.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks suffered declines last week with Tesla faring the worst, off about 13.5%. And despite the Mag Seven accounting for around 50% of S&P 500 gains this year, three of its members are lagging behind. Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the red year to date.And once again, you see Tesla leading losses. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, he's over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Such as it is, sometimes we group these stocks together arbitrarily. They might be doing something similar for a limited period of time and then they get stuck. And here we have the Magnificent Seven with huge dispersion between the contributions-- among the contributions to the S&P 500 market cap.You look at NVIDIA over there, it's up $965 billion. And then you take a look at Tesla down $231 billion. As NVIDIA's contributing 33% of the market cap gains of the S&P 500, Tesla is responsible for negative 8%.And sometimes math is just not intuitive that way. But the point is besides these four groups of stocks that are advancing, you have these other three. And to be fair, all seven of these stocks have very, very different narratives.I want to point out Tesla versus NVIDIA. So this is the first in class, this is last in class in the Mag Seven. And this what's happening year to date. You can see Tesla down about 27%, NVIDIA up about 78%.And if I show you a two-year chart, you can really see back when their fortunes diverged. Because it was off of the October lows in 2022 that we saw this big rally and we saw the Mag Seven, kind of, in lockstep. But you can see the fortunes diverging as we proceeded in the year, that was last year.Now, I also want to show some technical analysis on Tesla over the last five years. And what I'm seeing here is just a giant trading range with a couple of forays above and below. And so here we got above the trading range here. We got below around the turn of the year one year ago.But for the most part, we are in a trading range. Until that breaks, difficult to see or difficult to get excited about Tesla going in any direction or the other. It looks like it got a little bit of time.So I do want to go to our Mag 100-- or NASDAQ 100 heat maps so I can just check out the totals here. It's been interesting. I've been watching Eli Lilly surge ahead of Tesla in terms of market cap. And here we see Tesla at $571 billion short of AVGO, that's Broadcom. That change was made last week. And now Visa, looks like Tesla heading for Visa's market cap next.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/magnificent-7-laggards-tesla-stock-151336705.html
2024-03-11T15:02:05.000Z,TD taps into iPhones for a leg up in merchant acquiring,"Years after companies like Square convinced micro-merchants that they could accept payments with their smartphones, banks are starting to make the same pitch — without the need for an add-on ""dongle"" or similar hardware.TD Bank, for example, last week added Tap to Pay on iPhone to a growing bundle of products that it sells to businesses. Tap to Pay, also called softPOS, enables Apple or Android handsets to accept payments from contactless cards or mobile wallets. More payment companies are using Tap to Pay to enable fast and cheap contactless payment upgrades. PayPal adopted Tap to Pay last week to enhance the products it offers to merchants. Financial institutions can also use it to reduce merchants' reliance on third parties.""Small businesses are inundated with a number of applications to manage cash flow and back offices,"" said Jo Jagadish, executive vice president and head of commercial banking products, services and innovation at TD Bank, where she leads the bank's business payment strategy. ""Payments is just one of those capabilities that merchants use, but it can drive usage for other products.""The bank noted a massive consumer shift towards contactless payments that started during the pandemic, creating ongoing demand for merchants to adopt contactless payment, according to Jagadish. Tap to Pay enables businesses of all sizes to access mobile commerce and banking, but is particularly useful in reaching smaller merchants, she said.Tap to Pay is an Apple technology, but Apple is not a payment processor, creating an opportunity for other companies to sell the technology to banks or merchants. TD Bank added Tap to Pay through its collaboration with Autobooks. TD Bank is an investor in Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping provider, which it uses to support digital invoices, debit and credit card payments, cash flow management and accounting as part of the TD small business checking account.TD Bank has added other merchant services accessible via the checking account over the past few years, including Zelle and digital invoicing. All of these functions involve the mobile phone, making Tap to Pay a good fit, Jagadish said.""The majority of our customers use Apple devices,"" Jagadish said.TD Bank is upgrading its business banking operation as it faces challenges in other areas that involve technology. The bank is upgrading anti money-laundering systems amid a regulatory probe of AML practices at the bank and is also in the midst of an institution-wide cost cutting initiative. The bank's public relations office said the Tap to Pay deployment and related merchant services products are not part of the AML issues.Autobooks clients include Citizens Bank, Zions Bank and hundreds of small community banks. It has licensed its technology to FIS, Jack Henry, NCR and other firms that sell payments and financial technology. About 50 banks are live with Tap to Pay contactless payments via Autobooks.Another user, Centier Bank, has also used Tap to Pay as a bridge to a larger merchant product bundle. Centier, a $7.5 billion-asset bank that operates mostly in Northwest Indiana, offers accounting, checking and digital invoicing, among other merchant services. ""By using Tap to Pay, a business can support payments, sending and receiving through their bank account with us rather than worrying about a third party. We think that's an advantage for us,"" said Tim Coleman, senior vice president and director of wealth management and small business at Centier Bank.Tap to Pay enables the bank to support digital payments for all merchants, regardless of size, according to Coleman. The bank's clients include about 20,000 businesses, ranging from ""side hustles"" to larger manufacturing businesses, with a diverse mix of other merchants. ""It's an intersection of businesses. You never know where the demand is going to come from,"" said Coleman.TD Bank and Centier — and thousands of other financial institutions — are battling JPMorgan Chase, the largest merchant acquiring bank in the U.S. JPMorgan recently upgraded its merchant acquiring business by launching a platform that integrates payment channels alongside a set of tools that support checkout and other functions in stores, online and in mobile apps. JPMorgan added support for Tap to Pay for iPhone in 2023, and plans to add biometric check-in and additional contactless payment features in future deployments.All three banks compete with merchant-focused fintechs like Stripe, PayPal and Block, all of which have adopted softPOS or Tap to Pay. Adyen, a Dutch payment technology company, is using Tap to Pay to bolster its point of sale technology in brick and mortar in tandem with its e-commerce technology.Banks can integrate new products into existing services as a way to compete with larger institutions to attract merchants, including smaller businesses, according to Mattew Golden, president of Totavi, a card consulting practice.""The proliferation of standardized payment platforms such as Square, Stripe, Shopify and Toast means that fewer businesses are proactively making decisions about their underlying merchant acquirer; instead they are choosing a platform and then that platform is choosing an acquirer,"" Golden said, adding that to respond to this trend, institutions can connect businesses to newer payment technology using application programming interfaces or similar connecting technology — thus reducing the need for extensive integration.""As always, another area where smaller institutions can succeed is in service and support,"" Golden said.

2024-03-11T12:30:00.000Z,"1 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole","The ""Magnificent Seven"" have had a phenomenal run in terms of not only stock performance but also business gains. Well, except for one. Over the past 12 months, each member of the group has averaged these revenue growth levels:CompanyOne-Year Average YOY Revenue GrowthMicrosoft17.6%Apple(0.6%)Nvidia139.8%Amazon11.7%Alphabet8.5%Meta Platforms15.4%Tesla21%Data Source: YCharts. YOY = Year over Year.Two things stick out here. First, Nvidia is doing unbelievably well compared to its peers. Second, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has averaged losing revenue over the past 12 months while every other company on this list has grown.That's a huge red flag, making me want to stay far away from Apple's stock.When you dig in, it's evident that Apple's stock has become disconnected from the business. Most investors would assume that if Apple's revenue shrank over the past year, its stock would be flat or even down. But you'd be wrong.Apple's stock is up roughly 12% over the past year, making it the second-worst performer of the group behind Tesla (down 5%). But how can a stock that has shrinking revenue increase in stock price?Revenue doesn't have everything to do with how a stock is valued. There are a couple of other considerations to factor in. One of those is profits.Over the same period, its revenue averaged a decline, but its earnings per share (EPS) averaged an 8.8% increase. Because Apple was disciplined with its operating expenses and engaged in stock buybacks, it grew its EPS despite falling revenue. This is a sign of a strong and well-managed business, something most people would say about Apple.Another factor in Apple's stock price rise is multiple expansion. What people are willing to pay for a stock fluctuates, and depending on various factors, this number can rise or fall. How ""expensive"" a stock is often described by a valuation ratio, like the price-to-earnings (P/E) metric, which divides a company's stock price by its EPS.For Apple, investors were willing to pay more and more for shares, although this figure has come down since the start of 2024.Paying more than 30 times earnings for a company with shrinking revenue is very expensive, even for a company with the pedigree of Apple. This is part of why the stock has fallen nearly 12% since the start of 2024, while many of its peers have gained that much.But with a more reasonable stock price, why am I not willing to touch Apple's stock with a 10-foot pole?While Apple is a solid business, its products have nearly become commodities in the past few years. Plenty of other smartphone and accessory makers have quality products, so it comes down to user choice.Additionally, the sales cycles of these products have become elongated thanks to how advanced the latest product generations have been. This has caused revenue to stagnate and likely won't pick up anytime soon until Apple finds a new product to launch.Businesses can only maintain expenses for so long before raising prices or compressing margins. Both of these would harm Apple, and I don't envision a scenario where Apple can consistently grow its earnings at a healthy pace with low revenue growth.With the stock trading at 27 times earnings, it's way more pricey than its peer, Alphabet, which trades at 23 times earnings with better growth.At the end of the day, Apple isn't a bad company; it just isn't worth the price tag you must pay for it. With longtime Apple bulls like Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway selling shares, the writing may be on the wall for the formerly largest company in the world.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11T11:02:00.000Z,Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's outstanding surge in the past year has led to a massive jump in its market cap, and the semiconductor giant is now counted as one of the world's largest companies. More specifically, Nvidia's market cap of $2.22 trillion means it is now the third-biggest company globally, ranking just behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has a market cap of $2.61 trillion.It is worth noting that these tech giants have experienced divergent fortunes on the stock market in 2024. While shares of Nvidia shot up 79% this year already, Apple stock has moved in the opposite direction, dipping 12% as of this writing. As a result, Nvidia is now within touching distance of Apple's market cap.But can Nvidia stock continue soaring and overtake Apple's market cap by next year? Let's find out.A key reason Nvidia's market cap has grown while Apple's has declined is the different trajectories of the two companies. Nvidia is making the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, which is growing at a terrific pace. According to third-party estimates, the AI chip market is estimated to clock an annual growth rate of 38% through the end of the decade and generate $207 billion in annual revenue.Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion thanks to the lucrative AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it dominates with an estimated market share of 98%, according to Wells Fargo. Nvidia is also enjoying terrific margins in AI GPUs as its chips are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is reflected in the company's bottom-line performance, with its fiscal 2024 earnings jumping 288% to $12.96 per share.On the other hand, the smartphone market is Apple's bread and butter. The iPhone produced 58% of its total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended Dec. 31, 2023). However, Apple's top line increased just 2% year over year to $119.6 billion during the quarter, while earnings were up 16% to $2.18 per share. Its iPhone revenue increased 6% year over year during the quarter, while sales of iPads and wearables fell. Also, sales of Apple's MacBooks remained flat last quarter.A closer look at the end markets Apple serves tells us why it is growing more slowly than Nvidia. The smartphone market, for instance, is expected to grow by only 2.8% in 2024, as per IDC. The researcher estimates that smartphone sales will likely increase in the low single digits over the next five years. Tablet sales, meanwhile, are declining, while the personal computer (PC) market is forecast to turn around this year following steep declines in the past couple of years.Additionally, Apple doesn't enjoy Nvidia-like dominance in the markets it serves. Though Apple was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, its market share stood at 20.1%. Last year, Samsung was the second-biggest smartphone company, with a 19.4% market share. Apple was the fourth-largest company in PCs last year by shipments, controlling just 8.5% of this market.So, the bottom line is Nvidia is in pole position to capitalize on a fast-growing opportunity in the form of AI chips. Apple, however, is operating in mature markets where there are multiple contenders. As a result, it is unsurprising to see why Nvidia's revenue and earnings are forecast to increase much faster pace than Apple's.PeriodNvidia Revenue Rstimate (in $billion)Year-Over-Year GrowthApple Revenue Estimate (in $billion)Year-Over-Year GrowthCurrent fiscal year$110.281%$388.31%Next fiscal year$130.719%$412.76%Two fiscal years ahead$150.015%$433.45%Source: YCharts.Also, Apple's earnings are expected to grow at a much slower annual rate of 11% over the next five years compared to the 36% annual earnings growth Nvidia is expected to deliver during the same period. As such, seeing the market reward Nvidia with more gains won't be surprising. Apple stock, on the other hand, could remain in the doghouse thanks to the slow-growing nature of the smartphone market and recent developments suggesting the company may be late to the AI game.iPhone sales in China reportedly fell an alarming 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Huawei gained at Apple's expense and recorded a 64% spike in sales during the same period. Meanwhile, Apple's biggest smartphone competitor, Samsung, has already jumped onto the AI smartphone bandwagon with its latest Galaxy series of smartphones. The good news for Samsung is that it expects to sell more flagship phones than its original forecast, and AI seems to be playing a key role in driving this performance.This gives Samsung an advantage over Apple, which is yet to launch an AI-focused smartphone.Apple has already lost the title of the world's largest company by market cap to Microsoft. And now, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia displace Apple and climb up the rankings.As shown in the table above, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump to almost $131 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). Nvidia is trading at 35 times sales right now. While that's expensive, Nvidia has been able to justify its expensive valuation with outstanding growth in recent quarters.The solid opportunity in AI chips means the market could also reward Nvidia with a rich sales multiple in the future. Assuming Nvidia maintains a discounted sales multiple of 25 next year and generates $131 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $3.27 trillion.Apple, for comparison, trades at 7 times sales, slightly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 6. Giving Apple a higher sales multiple doesn't make sense, considering its slower growth. Assuming it generates $413 billion in revenue next year and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could go to $2.9 billion, indicating Nvidia seems set to become a bigger company than Apple by 2025.That's why investors looking to buy one of these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have an easy choice about where to put their money.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11T10:23:00.000Z,"Which Megacap Stock Has the Greatest GAAP Net Worth? Hint: It's Not Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia.","Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the biggest company of all? That might seem like an easy question to answer. Just use a stock screen that sorts by descending market cap.For much of the past few years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) claimed the biggest market cap of all publicly traded companies. Thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took over the No. 1 spot earlier in 2024. This AI boost has also put Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) within striking distance of the top position.But the real answer to the question depends on how you define ""biggest."" Warren Buffett recently discussed the biggest company based on net worth as measured by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). And it isn't Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia.GAAP net worth is better known by another name -- book value. It's also sometimes referred to as shareholder's equity.The calculation of GAAP net worth is straightforward:Determine a company's total assets (found on its balance sheet)Determine the company's total liabilities (also on the balance sheet)Subtract total liabilities from total assets to get the GAAP net worthThere's also an even simpler way to find a company's GAAP net worth. Just look at the value for total stockholders' (or shareholders') equity on the balance sheet.Microsoft's market cap tops $3 trillion. The tech giant's GAAP net worth, though, is a much lower $238.3 billion.It's a similar story for Apple. The iPhone maker has a market cap of more than $2.6 trillion. But Apple's GAAP net worth is only $74.1 billion.The difference is even more pronounced for Nvidia. Although the chipmaker's market cap has skyrocketed to over $2.3 trillion, its GAAP net worth is a little under $43 billion.So if the largest company based on GAAP net worth isn't Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia, which company holds the No. 1 spot? Since I mentioned Buffett earlier, you can probably guess who the U.S. winner is. It's his own Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B).As of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's GAAP net worth stood at nearly $561.3 billion. The conglomerate is more than twice the size of Microsoft based on the metric. It's nearly 7.6 times bigger than Apple and over 13 times larger than Nvidia.Berkshire boasts the largest GAAP net worth by far of any U.S. business in history, according to Buffett in his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders. He noted that the total GAAP net worth for the S&P 500 excluding Berkshire was $8.9 trillion in 2022. While the total hasn't been calculated yet for 2023, Buffett doesn't think that it will be much higher than $9.5 trillion. He pointed out that Berkshire by itself makes up roughly 6% of the total GAAP net worth of the entire S&P 500.But while Berkshire has the biggest GAAP net worth among U.S. companies, there's a company outside the U.S. that's even bigger. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the GAAP net worth for giant oil and gas producer Saudi Aramco totaled $1.75 trillion.Why don't Berkshire Hathaway and Saudi Aramco get more props for being the biggest companies based on GAAP net worth? There are some drawbacks to using the financial metric. For example, asset values can sometimes be understated or overstated. Intangible assets are especially tricky to accurately value.Market cap still matters. However, there's perhaps an even better measurement for determining the biggest companies -- enterprise value (EV). This metric adds a company's market cap and its total debt then subtracts cash and equivalents.What's the biggest megacap company based on EV?

2024-03-11T09:21:00.000Z,Warren Buffett Has Bought Shares of This Stock for 22 Consecutive Quarters -- and It's Not Apple or Occidental,"There are a number of great money managers on Wall Street, but few, if any, can hold a candle to the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" Warren Buffett. Since Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a greater than 4,900,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.Patient investors have become financially independent mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's investments. This can be done by analyzing Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the most recent quarter.But while Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have clued investors into a number of businesses Buffett appreciates, the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy -- one which he's added to for 22 consecutive quarters -- won't be found on his company's 13F.A quick glance at Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio would appear to suggest that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Warren Buffett's favorite business. After all, it accounted for 42.5% of invested assets as of the closing bell on March 6.Innovation is a big reason Apple held the title of world's largest publicly traded company for so long (it only recently ceded this title to Microsoft). Since upgrading iPhone to handle 5G speeds in late 2020, the company's flagship smartphone has accounted for half or more of domestic smartphone market share. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't understand the mechanics of how an iPhone works, he fully understands consumer behavior and the exceptional loyalty of Apple's customers to its products.But what investors may have overlooked is Apple's innovation beyond its physical products. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing an extended transformation that has Apple focused on various subscription services. Subscriptions should smooth out Apple's revenue recognition during iPhone upgrade cycles, steadily lift the company's operating margin over time, and encourage Apple's customers to stay within the company's ecosystem of products and services.However, the best aspect of owning a lot of Apple stock for Warren Buffett might be its unbeatable capital-return program. Apple is returning $14.8 billion annually in dividends to its shareholders, and has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett is a huge fan of businesses that reward long-term-minded investors like himself.The other stock in Berkshire's portfolio that you'd probably think is Warren Buffett's favorite to buy is energy juggernaut Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Since the beginning of 2022, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have purchased more than 248 million shares of Occidental -- a position with a market value of $15.2 billion.Although energy stocks haven't played a big role in Berkshire's portfolio throughout much of this century, the past couple of years have represented something of a change of heart for Buffett and his team. Piling into Occidental the way Berkshire's investment team has signals that they believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms, or perhaps head even higher.While it's tough to predict the directional movements of energy commodities with any certainty, there are factors working in Buffett's favor. For instance, capital underinvestment for multiple years from energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, it's not uncommon for the price of that commodity to rise.A higher spot price for crude oil would be noteworthy for two reasons for Occidental. First, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. If the price of oil climbs, it disproportionately benefits, when compared to other integrated oil and gas operators.Secondly, Occidental is still digging itself out of debt. The company is counting on a higher spot price to fuel the steady paydown of its remaining debt.Though it's abundantly clear that Apple and Occidental Petroleum are core holdings in the $361 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, neither stock has been purchased by the Oracle of Omaha for 22 consecutive quarters.To find Warren Buffett's favorite stock, investors will want to peer beyond the company's 13Fs and take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Contained within these operating results is a section on share repurchases. That's right -- the stock Buffett genuinely can't stop buying is shares of his own company.Share buybacks at Berkshire Hathaway took a big turn in mid-July 2018. Prior to this point, repurchases could only be undertaken if the company's shares traded at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire Hathaway's stock never retreated to or below this preset threshold, the company went years without any share repurchases.Everything changed on July 17, 2018, which is when Berkshire's board reworked the covenants governing share repurchases to allow Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger to work their magic.Under the new criteria, as long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and both Buffett and Munger agreed that shares of their company were intrinsically cheap, buybacks could continue with no preset cap.During the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett oversaw the repurchase of 3,623 Class A shares and 660,585 Class B shares (BRK.B) of Berkshire stock at a total cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the criteria for buybacks changed in July 2018, Buffett has bought back more than $74 billion worth of his company's stock, with repurchases occurring every single quarter.The reason the Oracle of Omaha and his team spend such a small fortune on buybacks is because it's the easiest way to reward investors who share their long-term vision. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regular buybacks are incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders.Furthermore, buying back stock can lift earnings per share (EPS) for businesses with steady or growing net income. As Berkshire's outstanding share count shrinks over an extended period, EPS should increase. Ideally, this makes Berkshire Hathaway appear even cheaper to investors.Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, Warren Buffett buying back shares of his favorite stock, Berkshire Hathaway, is a virtual given.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11T08:55:48.000Z,"Magnificent 7 Stocks Aren’t Too Pricey, JPMorgan Strategist Says","(Bloomberg) -- The ranks of Wall Street strategists playing down concerns around a bubble in US technology megacap stocks are growing.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackStocks Kick Off Key Inflation Week Under Pressure: Markets WrapThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, DirectorThe team at JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the latest to flag that valuations of the seven tech giants that have powered the record-breaking rally on Wall Street are currently lower relative to the rest of the S&P 500 than the average of the past five years.“There is a concern over the very strong outperformance of the Magnificent 7, but we note that the group is currently trading less stretched than a few years ago, given earnings delivery,” strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. “This is not to say that the group is immune to profit disappointments ahead, but in the case of general earnings disappointment, these stocks could still hold out better than traditional cyclicals” reliant on strength in the economy, he said.Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also said last week that while the US equity market’s concentration is the highest in decades, the top stocks trade at much lower valuations than the largest names did at the peak of the tech bubble.The Magnificent Seven stocks — comprising Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — had driven the biggest gains in the S&P 500 last year. The benchmark index has scaled all-time highs in 2024, but the performance of those mega-caps has diverged more recently.While AI darling Nvidia has soared to a record high, Apple shares entered a technical correction this month amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.A note from Bank of America Corp. last week showed technology funds suffered their biggest outflows on record.

2024-03-11T07:07:00.000Z,"A Third ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?","The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.The ""Magnificent Seven"" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.Alphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.The 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.For example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign.The 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock.Notice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.In the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.A great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.The market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.If you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.Another recent example is Target (NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.In sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.The best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.Similarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.In other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.Some of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.It happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.The point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.The biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.Apple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.The market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).The market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.Alphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-11T06:00:00.000Z,RPT-EU's Digital Markets Act hands boost to Big Tech's smaller rivals,"(Repeats story moved on Friday without change to text)By Foo Yun Chee and Martin CoulterBRUSSELS/LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.The DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.The sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.""The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,"" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.For example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.In practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.Meta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.Similarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.""The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,"" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.Google said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.Consumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.For example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.APP STORE WARSWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.Apple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.Under the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.Apple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.Apple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.The implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.Fortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.The Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.

Apple, which is a partner and also a competitor for domestic banks, doesn’t give access to the near field communication chip on its iPhones, and instead requires banks to send payments using Apple Pay.“They are very sophisticated companies who are playing a very deliberate game and it should be a very clear agenda item for government and policymakers,” Comyn said, referring to the US technology giant. He was speaking at the AFR Business Summit in Sydney.Macquarie Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Shemara Wikramanayake, speaking on a panel at the same conference later in the day, said she won’t buy into the regulation of the so-called Magnificent Seven, companies that do “an amazing job for the US and the world.”“The US and the world does need to allow other competition to come in, but that’s something for regulators to sort out,” she said when asked whether the Australian government should place more attention on Apple’s market power.“Basically we take the world as we see it and work with it. They’re contributing a lot and we’re focusing on the positive in how we engage with them,” she said.Comyn also reiterated his opinion on hybrid work, a policy which requires his staff to spend at least 50% of their time in the office.

2024-03-10T14:53:59.000Z,Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better,"Apple’s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it’s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you’re looking for a Windows laptop.But if you’re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that’s no different with the company’s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it’s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.Available March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple’s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.Both are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.My review unit came equipped with Apple’s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you’re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that’s the exact configuration I’d recommend you buy. It’ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.If you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.If you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you’re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.As far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year’s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.I’m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven’t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn’t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you’re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.The latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.Battery life is as fantastic as you’d expect from an Air running on one of Apple’s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I’ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.Of course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment’s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.One of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” thanks to the M3’s built-in neural engine. It’s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn’t exactly some kind of new development.It’s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it’s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.My only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you’re used to having a connector on your system’s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.Overall, Apple’s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you’ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you’re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you’re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it’s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple’s chips.It’s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year’s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don’t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it’s still a fantastic laptop.If you’d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won’t be disappointed.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-10T12:35:00.000Z,"Apple Could Launch Its Most Important Product Since the iPhone This Summer, According to a Pair of Wall Street Analysts","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) could use a new blockbuster product, and it could come as soon as this summer.The iPhone maker saw sales rise just 2% last quarter after a year in which revenue fell 2.8%. China remains a big question mark for Apple following a government ban of iPhones and a report indicating a massive decline in sales in the country to start the year. Meanwhile, the varying sources of its high-margin services revenue remain the focus of regulators around the world.But at least two Wall Street analysts think Apple will release the next product to set off a spurt of growth at the massive company this summer. Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe think investors should focus on what Apple will announce this summer at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).At Apple's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook promised investors the company will ""break new ground"" on generative AI this year.The claim follows comments the executive made during Apple's first-quarter earnings call. Cook said, ""We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort"" on AI, and ""I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI.""Apple recently shuttered its electric car development to focus more on the generative AI projects it's working on. Bloomberg previously reported the company is spending more than $1 billion per year on generative AI. But true to form, Apple hasn't talked much about what it's working on publicly before it's ready to announce a product set for release.That's coming this year, Cook says, and very likely planned for WWDC in June.""To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone,"" Reitzes and Monroe wrote in a note to investors. They see new AI features as a catalyst for a new iPhone supercycle next year as iPhone users upgrade their hardware to take advantage of new AI capabilities.While most AI companies are focused on either the hardware (semiconductors) or the software (large language models and applications), Apple, as always, is focused on the combination of the two. That could allow it to leapfrog competitors and push more AI capabilities to consumers.Apple builds some of the most advanced mobile processors on the market for the iPhone. A few years ago, it expanded its designs to its Mac lineup, and it now makes some very powerful chips for desktops and laptops as well. While these chips aren't going to power large language model training, which is mostly handled by remote servers full of GPUs, they may be exactly what's needed for on-device, or ""edge,"" AI applications.In other words, new Apple devices may be capable of implementing generative AI all while keeping data securely on a device. That opens the door for a lot more applications and use cases. And Apple could develop software that uses its large language model in a way that takes advantage of its capabilities.Another factor that separates Apple from the pack of big tech companies all developing products and services around generative AI is that Apple has multiple ways of monetizing its advancements in AI.Apple has historically made the bulk of its revenue from hardware sales. As Reitzes and Monroe mention in their note, AI advances could push more users to upgrade their iPhones. With over 2.2 billion active devices in use, it could sell a lot of iPhones just by convincing users to upgrade.More recently, Apple has focused on growing its services revenue, which leverages that massive user base. Apple could offer a subscription service that gives users more AI features. It could integrate it into its other subscription services like Apple Music and Apple News, or bundle it as part of its Apple One subscription.Apple could also give developers access to its AI models and other tools. That could be monetized through licensing revenue, or as analyst Dan Ives suggests, an ""AI app store.""The key differentiator for Apple is that it owns the platform, and it has several ways to monetize the user base on that platform. While shares currently trade for about 26x forward earnings, that valuation also takes into account Apple's massive cash position and its capital return program. If Apple's AI development proves to be its next big product, it could result in its price-to-earnings multiple expanding as revenue and profit growth reaccelerate.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10T12:00:00.000Z,"Bubble Angst Belied by Big-Tech Weaklings, Broader S&P 500 Gains","(Bloomberg) -- US stocks’ torrid climb to start 2024 is evoking worrisome comparisons with past boom-and-bust cycles on Wall Street, sparking debate over the risk that the market is overheating.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, DirectorBond Investors Are Lining Up to Fund the War Against PutinThere’s ample reason to wonder whether shares have advanced at an unsustainable pace: The S&P 500 Index has closed at record highs 16 times this year, accounting for about a third of all trading days; AI darling Nvidia Corp. has soared nearly 80%, adding roughly $1 trillion in market value, even after sliding Friday along with other tech shares; and speculative areas like Bitcoin have surged.Yet there are signs that the strength, based in large part on the economy’s resilience and robust corporate earnings, hasn’t turned into a speculative frenzy.Several of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks have sputtered, showing that investors aren’t throwing money at the market with abandon. The muted reaction to initial public offerings of late also backs up that notion. What’s more, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 just hit a historic high, indicating the rally is broadening out. And valuations of the benchmark’s biggest stocks are well below levels seen for the market leaders at the height of previous market cycles.Scott Chronert at Citigroup Inc. also notes that the seven megacap tech firms contribute roughly 20% to S&P 500 earnings, which he says largely justifies their market-capitalization weighting of about a third of the gauge.“There was a premise where you were trying to build out Internet infrastructure back then, much like right now we’re building out AI,” Chronert said. “But the nature of the companies’ revenue and the cash flows that are supporting it are markedly different.”Below are some charts that may dispel concerns of a bubble forming:Megacap DivideThe Magnificent Seven companies — Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia and Tesla Inc. — moved in unison through much of last year, driving the brunt of the market’s gains and reigning until very recently as the S&P 500’s biggest firms.The relentless demand for the group’s shares drew parallels to the speculative frenzy surrounding Internet stocks at the turn of the century.But the seven have diverged in 2024 as investors soured on the outlook for several firms, signaling that the froth around the cohort may have diminished.Apple has dropped this year, in part amid concern over iPhone sales in China. The firm closed at a record in December before retreating. With demand for its vehicles waning, Tesla has fared even worse, dropping below Eli Lilly & Co. in terms of market value. Google parent Alphabet has also declined this year.More ParticipantsCountering worries that a handful of shares were powering the bull run, the gains are showing signs of extending beyond just technology.The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index set a closing record last week for the first time in two years. The gauge gives an equal share to each constituent, rather than weighting by market capitalization.The share of S&P 500 stocks at all-time highs in the past month has risen, reaching the highest since early 2022, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Gillian Wolff show.Even so, less than a third of stocks are at records, “leaving plenty of room” for the bull market to gather participants, they said in a note.In contrast, by the time the tech bubble was about to burst in early 2000, the ratio of stocks at historic levels was waning, from around 60% at one point in 1997 to 20% at the turn of the century, the strategists wrote.IPO BluesInvestors’ limited appetite for new listings is another indicator that sentiment is short of the kind of euphoria typically seen around bubbles.In 1999, about 42% of US IPOs that raised more than $100 million saw share prices pop 50% or more through the close of the first day of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In 2024, only one — CG Oncology Inc. — has met that criteria.The US IPO market raised about $89 billion in 1999. While the market saw record business in 2021, it’s hit a wall since. There have been 36 IPOs in the US this year, raising $7.2 billion. In 2021, companies generated roughly $300 billion from around 1,000 deals.Valuations ComparedRobust profits from some of the tech behemoths have also brought down sky-high valuations. They remain relatively stretched, but they’re still well below prior peaks.The Magnificent Seven stocks, for example, trade near their average price-to-earnings ratio since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.And take the largest five S&P 500 stocks today. They trade at less than half the multiples of the top stocks in early 2000 — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell — a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis shows.Valuations are also contained across tech shares in areas including AI and robotics, with most of those baskets at or below their five-year average for price-to-sales multiples, according to BI.--With assistance from Elena Popina, Jessica Menton and Bailey Lipschultz.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/bubble-angst-belied-big-tech-120000734.html
2024-03-10T11:00:00.000Z,"6 Dividend Stocks Make Up 78.4% of Warren Buffett's $370 Billion Portfolio, and They Are All Cheaper Than the S&P 500","Famed investor Warren Buffett is known for finding quality businesses at a good value and holding them over time. When his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) first began investing in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, that stock traded at a steep discount to the market -- with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the range of 10 to 14.5 that year. Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today.A lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500.Berkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500. Combined with Apple, these six companies make up 78.4% of Berkshire's portfolio.Let's consider why Buffett and his team like these companies, and the qualities that make them good long-term holdings.In Berkshire Hathaway's most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett praised his longtime partner Charlie Munger for many things, including a key lesson he taught Buffett.Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ""Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.""Back then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.Berkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift. Apple is the undisputed leader in smartphones, consumer electronics, and wearable devices, and offers a wide range of services, many with high margins.Bank of America is the second-largest diversified bank behind JPMorgan Chase.American Express is a top credit card company, along with Mastercard and Visa (which Berkshire also owns shares in).Coca-Cola is the most valuable U.S.-based beverage company.Chevron is the second-biggest U.S.-based oil major, behind ExxonMobil. And Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, is one of the most valuable exploration and production companies and, assuming its deal with CrownRock L.P. goes through, will become one of the top producers in the Permian Basin -- the largest onshore oilfield in the U.S.In sum, Berkshire's biggest stock holdings are all among the top dogs in their respective industries. Many of them have another attribute that Buffett loves -- capital return programs.Over the last five years, Apple, Bank of America, and American Express have all boosted their dividends and bought back stock at impressive rates.Coke and Chevron have focused primarily on growing their dividends. Both have increased their payouts by more than 50% in the last 10 years. And Chevron has bought back a boatload of stock over the last two years. In 2023 alone, it spent a record $26 billion on dividends and buybacks.Occidental Petroleum is a bit of an outlier. In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since raised its quarterly payout several times, bringing it up to $0.22 per share, but it hasn't been exactly the type of consistent dividend payer Berkshire usually targets.Oxy is also known for using debt and leveraging up its balance sheet, which it will do to pay for its pending CrownRock acquisition.In Berkshire's 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett praised Oxy's leadership and wrote of his confidence in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Oxy stands out as a specific play on a specific theme. It amounts to 4.1% of the public equity portfolio, indicating that Berkshire is taking care to manage the position to make sure it doesn't become too large.You may be wondering, if these companies all have qualities that make them suitable investments, then why would they trade at a discount to the market? Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.Financial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.As for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei. So its valuation has come under pressure as investors search for companies that are growing in the near term.Berkshire's largest stock holdings showcase its highest-conviction names. Berkshire has owned some of these stocks for decades. Others, like Apple, Chevron, and Oxy, are more recent additions to the portfolio.The key takeaway is that Berkshire knows what it is looking for, and targets companies that fit its criteria -- not simply those that are tied to whichever hot trend is sweeping Wall Street. Berkshire invests in companies that are good values and have attractive capital return programs through dividends and buybacks.As an individual investor, it's important to find the types of companies and sectors you like. It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance. Buffett has often said that Berkshire purposely keeps a massive cash position and is conservative with its investments, but that's because capital preservation and limiting downside risk are integral parts of his philosophy.If you have a high risk tolerance or are multiple decades away from retirement, taking on more risk could make sense for you. But only if you are comfortable with risk and have the patience to hold onto stocks through periods of volatility.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10T08:49:00.000Z,"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Hit All-Time Highs, but It Could Be Just the Beginning If These 3 Stocks Join the Rally","As the calendar turned to March, the market has wasted no time bidding stocks higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closing at all-time highs.As of March 1, the S&P 500 is up 7.7% year-to-date (YTD), and the Nasdaq is up 8.4%. It's been a great run, but some fear that the market won't be able to keep up the pace.At this stage in the rally, it is asking a lot from top leaders like Nvidia to continue carrying the market higher. With a 4.5% weighting in the S&P 500 and a year-to-date return of 66.2%, Nvidia alone has contributed a staggering three percentage points to the S&P 500's YTD return. Put another way, Nvidia is responsible for 39% of the S&P 500's YTD return.Nvidia could keep going up, or it could stall. But the good news is that Nvidia doesn't have to lead the market higher.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have all missed out on the market rally. In fact, all three growth stocks have actually lost value in 2024. Here's what each company needs to do to regain favor on Wall Street, and what it could mean for the broader market.The ""Magnificent Seven"" refers to seven of the largest tech-focused companies. Together they make up 28.8% of the S&P 500. But only four of those stocks are doing well this year.Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla make up a combined 11% of the S&P 500. If these stocks turn things around, it could help push the S&P 500 higher even if Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms trade sideways from here.Apple has arguably the best overall case for a turnaround. The valuation isn't bad, with Apple trading at a 27.9 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is coincidentally the exact same as the S&P 500.The main issue is slowing growth out of China and a perceived lack of innovation with iPhone upgrades. Investors want to see Apple incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its products. It has been noticeably absent from the AI-fueled market rally.Investors who have been following Apple for a while know that the company is not one to overpromise and underdeliver by pre-announcing something flashy to boost Wall Street sentiment. Rather, Apple will wait, let the market do what it wants, and wait to reveal a new product, acquisition, innovation, etc. until it is ready.Two dates to keep track of would be the 2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June and then the unveiling of the iPhone 16, which should be in September.Investors will want to see meaningful strides across Apple's product line and the company's ability to capitalize on AI. As for the quarterly figures, investors will look for improvements from China, ongoing services growth and high margins, and strength from North America and emerging markets.Apple's main product threat is Huawei's new smartphone, which is weighing on its performance out of China. But China in general is down right now. Apple's moat isn't eroding, and it has dealt with plenty of competition before.It's easy to get negative on Apple stock right now. And to be fair, the stock could face a lot of short-term pressure between now and June or September (or beyond if it fails to deliver). But Apple's business isn't necessarily doing bad, it just looks bad compared to the scorching hot growth of the rest of big tech.Alphabet is in a similar but rockier boat. With an 11% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Its tried and true search engine business is still the undisputed market leader, but there's concern it could face unexpected threats as the competition makes strides in AI.Alphabet recently came under pressure because its Gemini 1.5 model was an AI disaster. It just seems like Alphabet has been lagging behind the competition in a field that it was once thought to lead. Google search is a brilliant algorithm built upon decades of AI innovation, but Alphabet is struggling to monetize new AI products right now.Until Alphabet reinforces its search fortress and gives the market something to get excited about, the stock will probably remain under pressure. The good news is that Alphabet isn't expensive. It is, by far, the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, trading at a mere 24.5 P/E ratio.Tesla stands out as arguably more vulnerable than Apple and Alphabet. Apple and Alphabet are already decent valuations relative to the market. So the further they fall, the more they may be considered by value investors.Tesla doesn't have that advantage. It has a lofty 47 P/E ratio and a 63.3 forward P/E ratio, which means that analysts believe the next 12 months of earnings will be lower than the last 12 months. In other words, negative growth.Even Apple and Alphabet have lower forward P/E ratios than their current P/Es because they are still growing, even in the near term.Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are achieving incredible results. Toyota stock is hovering around an all-time high. A big part of the rally is the company's success with hybrid vehicles, which have become a core part of its business strategy and are contributing to margin expansion. Toyota now has a higher operating margin than Tesla, which casts doubt on the sustained growth of electric vehicles (EV), at least in the short term.Tesla is facing a slowdown in EV adoption and mounting competition. It has also failed to monetize AI in a big way through fully autonomous driving.Tesla is still the market leader in EVs. But right now it's basically only doing one thing well, while the rest of the market is catching up. For Tesla to justify its current valuation, it has to show more growth outside of EVs.I wouldn't go as far as to say the long-term investment thesis for Tesla has changed, but the company has a lot of challenges that don't seem to be going away anytime soon.It would be great for the broader market if Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla joined the rally. But for the reasons discussed, there doesn't seem to be a fundamental reason for that to happen anytime soon.All three companies are facing slowing growth and competition. However, they also have vast financial resources to unlock growth for patient investors. The more Apple and Alphabet fall, the more they look like value plays. When Tesla returns to growth or announces some game-changing stride in AI, the stock could also start to look more reasonable.This market rally is fueled by specific themes and growth, so it's understandable why Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla have been left out.But long-term investing isn't about hopping on whatever trend is working in the short-term, but rather ensuring the businesses you invest in have what it takes to compound earnings over time. Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla have a long growth runway and plenty of potential, but they are all in ""prove it"" mode as far as the market is concerned. Holding all three stocks seems perfectly reasonable right now. And if there's one in particular you believe can address the market's concerns, then it may be an excellent time to buy it while it's out of favor.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-10T07:30:00.000Z,2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.However, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.Then, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.Despite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.So here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.Apple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.While declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.Moreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.The tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.However, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value.These are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.Apple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.A recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T17:58:54.000Z,13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever,"In this article, we discuss 13 best stocks to buy and hold forever. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever. The equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape. Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26: ""As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”To benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology We referred to long-term hedge funds that rarely buy and sell stocks, then found 13 stocks that they have held consistently for at least 10 years. These are the best stocks to buy and hold forever. These hedge funds include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant company operating in the United States and globally. It operates through three segments – Wendy's U.S., Wendy's International, and Global Real Estate & Development. On February 15, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of March 1. It is one of the best stocks to buy. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 31.4 million shares worth $613 million. Trian Partners has held a stake in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) consistently since 2013. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best stocks to buy.Oakmark Equity and Income Fund made the following comment about The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)’s is the second-largest quick-service burger chain in the U.S. This iconic brand generates $13.3 billion of systemwide sales from 7,095 restaurant locations around the world. Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a global risk assessment firm with two main segments – Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. The company provides institutional risk management, credit research and structured finance solutions, credit ratings, and assessment services for debt obligations and entities. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) declared a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is payable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of February 23. On February 5, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authority.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 58 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 24.6 million shares worth $9.6 billion. L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.We continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.The Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.The share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyze Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the American multinational beverage giant, is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15. The company’s revenue in Q4 2023 increased 7% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $150 million. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $23.5 billion. Hayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products. The company operates through four segments – U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services, International Card Services, and Global Merchant and Network Services. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provided optimistic guidance for 2024, surpassing analyst expectations, despite the Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue falling short of estimates. American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration. The projected 2024 EPS is between $12.65 and $13.15, exceeding the consensus estimate of $12.30, with an anticipated revenue growth of 9%-11%. This guidance implies a 2024 revenue range of $66.0 billion to $67.2 billion, compared to the consensus of $66.2 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 74 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $28.4 billion. In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of human health products, including oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and vaccine products. The Animal Health segment focuses on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and health management solutions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03 and a revenue of $14.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.14 and $120 million, respectively.According to Insider Monkey's fourth quarter database, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was part of 98 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 85 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $1.5 billion.Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading manufacturer and provider of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices. TSMC ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a Q4 GAAP EPADR of $1.44 and a revenue of $19.62 billion, outperforming Wall Street expectations by $0.05 and $50 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 105 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 107 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 31 million shares worth $3.2 billion. Baron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the fourth quarter due to investor expectations for a cyclical recovery in semiconductors heading into 2024 and significant incremental demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company with operations worldwide. It operates through Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. On January 30, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, in line with market consensus. The revenue increased 10.7% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $60 million. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 120 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.8 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever. Jackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.5 million shares worth $174.3 billion. Horizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.  Suggested articles:12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to AvoidJim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024 Disclosure: None. 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/13-best-stocks-buy-hold-175854400.html
2024-03-09T15:15:00.000Z,Will Apple Be a $3 Trillion Stock by 2025?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) became the world's first $3 trillion company last June. By Dec. 14, 2023, its stock had hit its record high of $197.86, lifting its market cap to $3.08 trillion and seemingly securing its spot as the world's most valuable company.But today Apple's stock trades at about $170 per share with a market cap of $2.63 trillion. Microsoft, which surpassed that market cap this January, is now worth $2.99 trillion. Let's see why Apple lost its luster over the past three months, if it can regain its footing this year, and if it can become a $3 trillion stock again by 2025.The bulls abandoned Apple this year for four simple reasons. First, its sales of iPhones -- which accounted for 58% of its top line in its latest quarter -- are slowing down. Its iPhone sales dipped 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) and only grew 6% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended.Competitive and macro headwinds in China exacerbated that slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 24% year over year in the first six weeks of 2024 amid stiff competition from Huawei.Second, Apple couldn't offset that slowdown by selling its other products. Its Mac sales fell 27% in fiscal 2023 amid the broader PC market's slowdown, then rose less than 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Its sales of iPads slumped during both periods, its Apple Watch sales were temporarily halted last December amid a patent dispute, and the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget for tech enthusiasts. It also recently abandoned its decade-long plans to build an electric car. As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 1% and 7%, respectively, this year.Third, Apple's valuations were inflated by a flight toward safe-haven stocks as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds rattled the market. Even after its year-to-date decline, Apple's stock still doesn't look like a bargain at 26 times forward earnings -- and its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.6% probably won't limit its downside potential.Lastly, the European Commission recently hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine for banning streaming music rivals like Spotify Technology from informing its users of cheaper payment options outside of its App Store. Apple can easily pay that fine, but it could pave the way toward a broader crackdown on its entire services segment -- which serves more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is often cited as a catalyst for its long-term growth.Apple's near-term future is murky. During its shareholder meeting in late February, CEO Tim Cook claimed Apple would ""break new ground"" in generative artificial intelligence (AI) this year -- but that statement sounded like an eleventh-hour attempt to hop aboard the AI bandwagon that had previously driven Microsoft's stock to its record highs. Apple reportedly plans to add new generative AI features to Spotlight, its integrated search tool for Siri and iOS, but it's unclear if those upgrades will meaningfully widen its moat against Microsoft's Copilot and Alphabet's Google Assistant.If Apple's AI plans fail to meaningfully boost its sales over the next few quarters, its stock could lose its premium valuation and be revalued relative to its near-term growth potential. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to only grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 8%.For reference, IBM -- which is growing again as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at CAGRs of 4% and 6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2026. Based on those expectations, IBM trades at just 22 times this year's earnings. It also pays a much higher forward yield of 3.4%.If Apple is also revalued at 22 times forward earnings, its stock would drop another 15% to the mid-$140s, reducing its market cap to $2.2 trillion. So unless Apple can pull a few rabbits out of its hat, it probably won't impress the bulls and regain its $3 trillion valuation by the beginning of 2025. But over the long term Apple could still get its act together as it rolls out new products and services -- so it's still too early to write it off as a mature tech giant that has run out of room to grow.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Musk famously helped found OpenAI in 2015 and Matt, his suit centers on the idea that OpenAI was originally founded to be a non-profit and mission oriented toward, ideally maybe AI help humanity. We've seen it pivot now to more of a private enterprise. What are you paying attention to at this case?Matthew Argersinger: I think this is a big deal and I think Musk has a pretty good case [laughs] and I would say the implications could be pretty stark for really the whole AI landscape. If you think about it, OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. I think most analysts, investors would probably point to that day as the day that the AI revolution started. Maybe Nvidia's first-quarter results in 2023, another milestone, but clearly when ChatGPT came out, it was big deal. If you just look for a second, at the stock price of Microsoft since that day, since November 30, 2022. Remember Microsoft invested one billion dollars in OpenAI in 2019 and has been pivoting it to a more commercially viable for profit platform. Since November 30, 2022, the share price of Microsoft is up more than 60%. Over that period of time, it's added more than one trillion [laughs] in market cap to its valuation. Now, granted, not all that can be true and attributed to OpenAI, but I think a bunch of it certainly is, I think the excitement around AI and with the idea that Microsoft is now because of its investment, a leader in this new market, it's a big deal. I think the one of the reasons Microsoft trades for 37 times earnings today, or something like Alphabet trades for 20 times earnings. This disparity there I think is because of what investors are ascribing to the value of AI that Microsoft has. Just imagine for a second, if Musk succeeds in his lawsuit, suddenly the commercial implications of Microsoft investment and OpenAI itself goes away. I just think this has enormous implications, not just for Microsoft or the generative AI industry today, but really for the development and evolution of AI as we go forward from here.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, the ramifications seem crazy and wild and things we're going have to figure out over time. I think one of the things that's fascinating about it too, is we're not legal scholars by any stretch, Matt. But there have been a lot of behind the scenes drama with OpenAI. We saw Sam Altman seemingly leave the company and come back in a very short period. We may, through the process of discovery and this case, learn a little bit more about what's been going on at OpenAI.Matthew Argersinger: Absolutely. More information, more transparency is going to come out of this whole period that we've been only reading the headlines, but now we'll get to really understand what's happening and in a way it's going to hurt Microsoft and OpenAI because all this stuff is going to be out in the open for competitors like Alphabet, maybe Apple down the road. We'll talk about to understand exactly how they compete better with this platform.Dylan Lewis: Speaking of Alphabet, also in the news in AI this week, Google's Gemini generative AI tool ran into issues with image and text generation. A lot of headlines this week, as users noted, Gemini declined to produce images depicting people of certain races, struggled to depict certain specific figures correctly confusing some of the racial and gender identities also had some controversy with its text-generation tool, leading to some offensive and problematic output. Jason, this is a new tool and I think we can zoom in on the Gemini specific part of the story, but we can talk broadly here about generative AI. Do you feel like some of these headlines and some of the instances that we're seeing out here are just the growing pains that you'd expect to see with the new technology?Jason Moser: To an extent, yes. Anytime a new technology like this is introduced, you have to go into an understanding it's going to take a long time to develop and have to learn essentially really the true used cases for it and how it's going to make us in society better. You have to expect some growing pains now. With that said, I would be concerned. This was a real eye-opener. Some of the stuff that this thing was spitting out was laughable, it was really just totally off the wall. We know that a lot of these large language models suffer from hallucinations, spitting out wrong information. I think with AI, one of the ideas behind it, it's supposed to make our lives more efficient, we can get work done more quickly, things will be more accurate. We're not quite there yet. We have a society generally speaking, there's still somewhat skeptical of this. There's Pew Research, I've quoted this several months back, but there's Pew Research overall that says that 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about the increased use of artificial intelligence. Just 10% say they are more excited than concerned and 36% say there's a mix of emotions right now. I don't think things like this help people feel more excited. No, not at all. There's that problem in winning the people over, so to speak. But then for Alphabet specifically, I think this becomes a bigger issue because, I think probably all of us here at this table would agree that Google is seen as a laggard in AI right now, a company that has not quite kept up with the others in the space. There is some reputational risks that comes with this. These types of mistakes, it can run the risk of sending people fleeing and never wanting to come back.Dylan Lewis: Yeah and Jason, this is not the first misstep we've seen. It's fairly high-profile misstep we've seen from Google's AI ambitions. They put out what was a fairly impressive demo of their AI results. I think that was as they were transitioning Bard over to Gemini. We later found out that demo was somewhat faked or edited a little bit so that the experience was cleaner, which led to a lot of controversy. It seems like not only are they a laggard in the space, but I look at the businesses of big tech and I think they are probably one of the companies that most needs to be getting things right in the zone.Jason Moser: It feels that way. I tell you, it really speaks to I think the human element that's involved with all of this. This is all something that is ultimately born from people building these machines, these models, and letting these models feed off themselves and learn from themselves. The big question is floating around is Sundar Pichai, the guy to lead this company forward? He is absolutely on the hot seat here. There are questions of Google and Alphabet's culture. Is this something that he can fix? That question, I think will remain for some time to come. I really wouldn't be surprised, they went from Bard rebranded a Gemini. I really feel like they're going to have to rebrand from Gemini. They really tarnished that name Gemini because I think for most people now when they see Gemini, they hear that word or they see that brand, their mind's not going to a good place. It's just really difficult to get that back. It's not to say they can't, but they were already behind. It's really going to take a lot of work to get back to where they need to be.Dylan Lewis: Our final AI-ish story this week. After over a decade of work, Apple is ending its vehicle ambitions. Those working on the company's very secretive project Titan Initiative will be shifted over to Apple's AI division. Jason, this is kind of an AI story, it's also kind of a car story. Why don't we take the car angle here first? Are you surprised that we never got to see an Apple car?Jason Moser: Not really. It always stood out to me is a little bit odd that they would really do that. But then it's Apple. This is one of the most important businesses in the world, they should be trying this stuff. If they tried it and felt like the juice wasn't worth the squeeze and I credit them for going ahead and just backing out. Now the one question I posed earlier in the week, because I think this is an interesting way to look at this. We've seen recently out, EVs are under fire. Hybrids are getting a little bit more of the headlines share right now, and Gas Guzzlers are on the rise as well. How does this make Elon Musk feel? Because, of course, some would say, hey, this is great, that's one less competitor in the space. The flip side of that is, Apple's looking at that and saying, well maybe he's just really isn't worth our time and money because they feel like that EV opportunity is somewhat capped, at least in the near-term. I don't know the answer to that, but generally speaking, I think this makes a lot of sense. It just doesn't feel like it was something that was really in Apple's core proficiency.Matthew Argersinger: I'm having trouble buying your argument that Apple was too far behind. Then you're seeing that argument that they're too far behind it, really designed to create EV. Were they too far behind BlackBerry or Nokia when they came out with the iPhone [laughs] 15 years, 16 years ago? I just think they might have looked at a little bit at the landscape. Competition from China in the long run, extremely hard to compete against. With the low cost manufacturers that they have in that country. It's also a little bit to Jason's point, it's like the infrastructure out there for EVs is very poor right now. I know this is an EV owner. Try to do a road trip in the cold in the winter but more than four hours. Good luck. I think Apple might've said we could design a great car. It's just not the right landscape right now. It's just the environment is not going to fit with the quality of the car that we want to bring to the market.Dylan Lewis: Jason, very few companies could afford to spend about a decade and $10 billion on a project that never winds up going anywhere. Was the car part of any of the Apple thesis for you in your head?Jason Moser: No, never was. Honestly, $10 billion for a company like that.Dylan Lewis: How much did Zuckerberg spend on the Metaverse?Jason Moser: He's still spending that. I think we're all still asking the question as to whether that's actually going to be worth it. If you have Apple thrown out the Vision Pro there, which is raising a lot of questions right now and they follow that up with a car. Then all of a sudden maybe you've got a disturbing trend where this company that's been changing our lives for so long. Now, maybe they're on this losing streak and I know they don't want to be on that, so it feels like this was the right call, so you appreciate the discipline there.Dylan Lewis: No question. Coming up after the break, we've got an earnings rundown and a new buzzword in tech. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined in studio by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. The beat is on for earnings season. We've got updates from Okta, Axon, and Salesforce to run through. Jason, let's start with Axon. A great week for the company and might I add my portfolio shake-up, 13% after the body camera and Taser maker posted earnings. Strong results from the company and it seems like the good times just continue for Axon.Jason Moser: But I feel like, well all three-year shareholders here.Dylan Lewis: Absolutely.Jason Moser: I think they're going to need to change their mission from to protect life to protect life and portfolios [laughs] because they clearly are doing a very good job at both. This is a company that just continues to fire on all cylinders, they say. Revenue $432 million exceeded their own expectations up close to 29% from a year ago. Really driven by strong demand across all product categories. The Cloud software continues to really perform. You look at net revenue retention, 122%. They do such a good job of keeping their customers and upselling, innovating new devices, and whatnot. Ultimately, we saw Non-GAAP earnings per share $1.12 up from $0.70 a year ago. An annual recurring revenue grew 47% from a year to $697 million. Again, driven by that Axon Cloud software growth.Dylan Lewis: Jason, the stock is now at all-time high and shares are up I think more than fivefold over the last five years. I've enjoyed that climb. You mentioned the Cloud segment and that has been a really big part of what's been pushing this company forward. Do you feel like there's still plenty of growth ahead?Jason Moser: I do. Once they get those devices out there, the Cloud and services revenue is what keeps their customers locked in there. We saw that revenue growth of 44% for the quarter really just demonstrates that. Then I think ultimately they're guiding for 20% plus top-line growth here for the foreseeable future based on that installed base and the innovations they continue to make on that software side. Along the way with a couple of little bolt-on acquisitions, they've now raised their total addressable market from $50 billion to $63 billion. Which the company that's really just generating a couple of billion dollars revenue right now. You can see the opportunity that's out there. I just don't think that need for public safety is going to go anywhere anytime soon.Dylan Lewis: All right Matt, before the break, a tease. We've got a new buzzword in tech. It popped up in Salesforce's quarterly update and that's dividend.Matthew Argersinger: Yes. Salesforce, not a business I follow closely but just look at the results first. I mean, really impressed by the operating leverage in this business. 11% revenue growth turns into 51% operating profit growth, pretty impressive. Even though top-line growth is expected to slow this fiscal year to 9%, we're still targeting 45% increase and earnings per share. But you said the word dividends, which of course got me excited. Salesforce is going to pay its first dividend, $0.40 per share per quarter. This of course follows in the footsteps of Meta Platforms. Dividends are apparently the new hotness in Silicon Valley and I like it. What I don't like though guys, is the fact that more often than not, these dividend announcements seem to be initiations are in conjunction with or even second-fiddle really two big new buybacks. To use Salesforce as an example, they just announced a $10,000,000,000 increase in their repurchases. Last year, the company spent 7.6 billion buying back their stock. Guess what happened to Salesforces diluted share count? It went from 984 million a year ago to, drum roll please, 983 million at the end of last quarter. What is that? 0.01% maybe?Dylan Lewis: Slight reduction.Matthew Argersinger: Yeah in the consulate. Like most big tech and software companies, they're spending billions of dollars just to offset the dilution from new stock issuance. I just think at especially at these valuations today, to be doing these buybacks, crying out loud, NVIDIA is doing buybacks. I love the dividend part. I just wish less was being spent on buybacks, more on the dividend, focus on cost cutting and taking away a lot of that dilutive share issuance and just pay more dividends.Dylan Lewis: Jason, as Matt mentioned, Salesforce following in the footsteps of Meta initiating a dividend, do you think we might see more big tech companies, maybe companies that hadn't considered dividend policies in the past, start to think twice about that?Jason Moser: Well, we've been talking for a while about Alphabet possibly doing something like this given their recent missteps, I got to believe that's probably not the number one priority right now. Alphabet's one with the same thing. They issue so many shares. The buybacks just are not bringing that countdown like we'd like to see and the top it all off, no dividend. A company that generates this kind of cash with that kind of balance sheet, it feels like a great opportunity to do it.Dylan Lewis: It would change the narrative right now, which they could use.Jason Moser: Obviously, Berkshire Hathaway, same argument, obviously, much different company. But it does feel like these big companies are a little bit more under fire right now to return a little bit more to shareholders.Dylan Lewis: We'll wrap our earnings run down with a look at Okta. Shares up 20% after the security, an identity management company reported. This was a business that had some bad news a little while ago, Jason, but it seems like they've been able to shift the narrative and get back on track.Jason Moser: Yeah, this was really a nice bounce-back quarter for the company. They've been dealing with some headwinds here over the last several months, a recent security breach. I'm sure most people know about and left a few questions out there but it seems like they've gotten back down brass tax, starting to win back the trust. My philosophy with these types of companies, it's not if there is some sort of security breach, it's a matter of when and then it's a matter of how they handle it, and what lessons they learn from recovery. Let's hope that they've taken away some good lessons and they've recovered nicely from this. It seems like based on the metrics that things are going in the right direction. Subscription revenue was up 20% of $591 million. Remaining performance obligations grew to 13% and the balance sheet remains in terrific shape. Some of the other metrics, they grew total customers to 18,950. That's up from 17,600 a year ago. I will say to be fair, customer acquisition right now, that's something that's slowed them down a little bit. Management is tweaking their go-to-market model a little bit. It gives teams a little bit more specific focus on either acquisition or upsell. I think there's an opportunity there based on the model there. There's a 111% in dollar-based net retention rate down not surprisingly, from 120% a year ago, as enterprises out there continued to be very mindful of their spending. But Okta really is one of those mission-critical style businesses that once companies start using and then they expand that identity protection portfolio of services, it becomes a little bit more difficult to extract yourself from that, so customers tend to stick with them for a while.Dylan Lewis: That's as-a-service at its best, right?Jason Moser: There you go.Dylan Lewis: We are most of the way through earnings season. We still have some companies coming up. But Matt, I'm curious, any surprises or anything you're still looking forward to this season?Matthew Argersinger: Not really. Overall, I think it's been a pretty strong earning season I have to say. I would point to some of the [inaudible] I tend to talk about on the show. Just having done really well and still trading for just incredibly low valuation. If you're looking for opportunities of stocks that haven't really bounced, you want to check that out.Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser. Fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we've got to dive into the world of pharma and patent cliffs. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Over the past few years, the pharma industry has been front-and-center, bringing incredible innovations to market at warp speed but if you're interested in buying pharma stocks, there's a lot to learn. In this week's interview segment, Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with analyst Karl Thiel about the role of patents in pharmaceuticals and the dreaded patent cliff looming for roughly 200 big-time drugs over the next decade.Deidre Woollard: In simple terms, as I understand it, patent cliff is simply when the value of a drug that a company develops plummets when it goes off patent. But I understand that that's a simplification so tell us a little bit more about how patents work in the pharmaceutical space.Karl Thiel: Well, no. That's not a simplification. That's absolutely what it is. Drugs are protected by patents. In some ways, the drug industry is the poster child for why patents exist. They spend sometimes well over a billion dollars to develop a drug. It takes over a decade to do it and so in order to take on that risk, they are rewarded with exclusivity. Nobody can compete with that specific drug for a period of time. That period of time is 20 years. That's how it's been since 1994. It has changed over the decades but you get 20 years of exclusivity from when you file your patent. After that, generics can enter and the benefit for society then is that the price of that drug should plummet. It should become very affordable to everybody.Deidre Woollard: That's interesting because there's examples. Pfizer and Lipitor is the big example. In 2011, the sales fell by over 80%. But is it always a cliff like that where they sell right up until the date and then it just falls off like that?Karl Thiel: Well, they will absolutely [laughs] sell up until the date. They will get every dollar that they can out of the drug while it's exclusive. And then is it always a cliff? That's a really interesting question and it's going to become increasingly relevant in the next half decade or so. There's different kinds of drugs out there and you talked about Lipitor, which is a drug that a lot of people are familiar with. It's a pill. It's what's called in the industry, a small molecule. Which means that it's got a relatively simple chemical structure that should be something that another company can formulate and make essentially exactly the same way as the original company. And so you get a generic version. Generic Lipitor should be exactly identical to the Lipitor Pfizer made. They should be interchangeable products. For that reason, when it suddenly becomes available and cheaper, prices tend to plummet. It's not unusual for an innovator drug to lose 90% of its market share often quite quickly. I think Lipitor lost 70% of its markets within the first six months. They were considered quite innovative at the time for all the things they did to protect that market but that's how it went. What's different is that a lot of drugs these days are biologicals.They're the fruits of the biotech industry and they are things like monoclonal antibodies and peptide drugs and cell therapies and things that are very difficult to manufacture. If you look at the chemical structure of them, they're insanely complicated. They're not drugs that you whip up in a chemistry lab, they're drugs that you grow in a vat. Something like a monoclonal antibody is this huge molecule with all these amino acids wrapped up in a certain way and those amino acids get decorated with little sugars on the outside in a process called glycosylation. The upshot is that you can never guarantee that anyone else can make a product that is identical to that. That's why when ''generic biologic'' doesn't exist they're called biosimilars. They're called biosimilars because they are presumed to be similar to the original product but they're not the same. Because of that, the market's just developed a little bit differently.One thing is that you can't just say look, our chemical is the same as this chemical so let us sell it. You have to do some level of clinical studies to at least show that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as it's known, are similar to your drug, that your drug acts like the other drug. You have to do some studies. What you end up happening is much fewer competitors and often not quite as much of a price decrease. That is a big difference with what a patent cliff. Biosimilars have been with us since 2009, we're about 15 years into it since the Affordable Care Act first introduced the mechanism. For a lot of the history biosimilars have not caught on all that much. You've tended to have the original innovators still keep a lot of their market. You haven't seen prices come down as much as you expect. But that may be starting to change and that's going to be critical in the next few years.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. As I understand it, if I'm making a drug like Lipitor and I just want to make a generic, it's relatively easy but if I want to make a duplicate of the biosimilar, it's much more complicated now. You mentioned the studies, do they have to go through a separate FDA approval, or is it because it's already approved they can circumvent that process?Karl Thiel: It's a truncated process. It's much easier than creating a drug from scratch because it's already been proven that this particular approach will work and that's all been done in clinical trials. You can reference the innovator companies data but you do have to do some level of clinical work to prove that your drug is in fact acting like the original ones so it is a little bit more complicated. Part of the reason this is so important is if you look at a list of the top-selling drugs in the world right now, they are dominated by biologics. A few of them are small molecules but [laughs] they are dominated by biologics. People talk about a patent cliff so there is a big one [laughs] coming up between now and 2030. There's going to be something like 190 blockbuster drugs that are going to lose their exclusivity and they represent something like $236 billion in sales. I think somebody calculated. It's enormous, but a lot of them are biologics. In order for this all to work for society, we need to [laughs] have the process work, have these biosimilars come along, and have them actually be adopted and actually drive down prices for people. That's the idea behind this. We'll see what will happen.Deidre Woollard: Well, it's interesting because it sounds like with the previous process with just a single drug, doctors are going to feel confident, they're going to prescribe the generic. Why not? That's how things work. In this case, is there going to be any concern about those biosimilars? How will that work? Or do we really not know at this point?Karl Thiel: The biosimilars that have been approved, I think they're faithful. They should work just like the innovator drugs and I think most prescribers are probably comfortable with that. It's always possible that there is some individual out there who has some sensitivity to something. That's not the reason here. I'll tell you something, Deidre. HUMIRA, top-selling drug in the world, $21 billion in sales, beginning of 2023 had a biosimilar launched. Sorry, it peaked sales in 2022. Anyway, Amgen had the first biosimilar on the market. They launched two versions of it. One was priced at a 55% discount to AbbVie's price for HUMIRA and the other one was priced at a 5% discount. Which one do you think was more popular?Deidre Woollard: I would assume everyone's going for that 55%.Karl Thiel: So it was the 5% one that tended to be more popular because of the way [laughs] that these Things get paid for. Usually, these drugs go through pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs. PBMs can negotiate a bigger discount if they take the 5% discounted version and then negotiate a big discount on top of that and then pocket part of that. There's a lot of very strange parts of how our healthcare system works and a lot of it was some problem that came up 20 years ago and somebody solved it by sticking a piece of chewing gum there and now there's more wads of gum here and there. It's a very crufty system that often defies all sorts of logic, but that's one part of it. And I think that's a reason, I'm not saying that's the only reason, but that is a reason that biosimilars have been somewhat slow to catch on. Often on the face of it, you're like this isn't even much of a discount.Deidre Woollard: Well, when we were talking before the show, you mentioned that it may not be just one patent, but that there's all these different patents that can go into a particular drug, which makes determining when this clip is a little more complicated.Karl Thiel: So there's different kinds of patents. There is almost ever a single patent that rules the fate of a major drug. When a company realizes that it has a successful drug on their hands, they are gonna do everything they can to protect it. So the rocket Gibraltar is what's called the composition of matter patent, which is the patent that says, we've invented this chemical. It never existed before. This is plainly our invention and that's the patent. Those are very seldom with anybody even try to get around that patent, you just wait for it to run out. But there are lots of other ways [laughs] to patented a drug in to try to extend that life a little bit. So you'll often find that in what's called the FDA Orange Book, which collects all these Things, there can be hundreds of patents on a single product. So there will be an argument. So when a drug actually goes generic, so for instance, the drug Eliquis is one that's coming up. This is a drug that's an anticoagulant drug, it's used for Things like Afib and stuff like that. I believe their original patent expired in 2023. But they got it extended by the patent office, because you can do that in certain stack circumstances. That's one strategy you can use. They gathered extended because you can argue that, we filed but you took too long to issue where we lost time there; or you can say, FDA took too long to review the drug, we lost time there. So you can sometimes argue with the Patent Office to extend it. They extended it to 2026. But then you start this legal battle in which you say, look, that's that patent, but we have a whole bunch of other patents that we think protected out to X date and you start fighting it out in court. Usually what will happen is the generic manufacturers will settle and they'll come to some date where they say, OK, we all agree you can launch on this date. That way, we don't really have to determine whether these other patents aren't going to be enough to protect it or not. With Eliquis that happens to be April of 2028, which is when generics will launch. But you can argue that that's five-years too late.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. My mother ticks Eliquis, so I'm particularly interested in that one. So that's one way to extend the patent cliff and it seems like there's other strategies. I know one of the Things, some companies say they don't want to be in an area where there's going to be a lot of that generic competition, so they focus on certain diseases, maybe with a smaller market. Some of them they tried to put out another drug, almost a piggyback, so that they don't lose that revenue. What other kinds of strategies do you see in play there?Karl Thiel: Ideally, what a company tries to do is it has a drug that works for a certain disease and they tried to make a better one. Then everybody will switch to that hopefully because it's just a better drug. I would say a company like Gilead Sciences for instance, which is very much the leader in HIV treatment, has made its name in many ways about both improving drug's effectiveness but also just improving the convenience. So that's one thing you might do is like, hey, you'd probably don't want to take a pill three times a day, we've come up with a way to have just once a day pill. Sometimes you can say, well look, is the difference between some of these convenience factors such that this one should really be priced at 50 times this other one. But in fact, if you have insurance, you're often insulated from that and if you don't, you're often caught out by it. So it's a very complex and interesting situation, but certainly yeah.Coming up with different ways of delivering drugs, coming up with next-generation versions that work better or that maybe have fewer side effects, Things like that are all certainly legitimate strategies to try to keep your leadership in an area.Dylan Lewis: Motley Fool Money listeners, want more industry dives like this one? Let us know what you want to hear by shooting a snowed at radio@fool.com. Coming up next, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. So don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. We're going to get over to our radar stocks in a minute. But first, it was an up and down week for surge pricing and restaurant chain Wendy's, the company announced plans to test dynamic pricing, which was met with swift blowback. They later clarified that would not be using the surge pricing we might be familiar with, with Uber and some of the other ride-hailing companies when demand is high, but instead might test offering discounts during slower times of the day for customers. Jason, do you think we'll see more businesses play with dynamic pricing?Jason Moser: Probably. I mean, we probably will. There's clearly not the only company that has done that. I mean, we see a ride-sharing, I think is one that stands out or poor while surge pricing really play into the model. It feels to me like with restaurants, particularly fast food restaurants, it's probably not the best idea. I mean, it just seems to add a level of complexity that creates a bad experience for everyone, from the employee to the customer. You're talking about baconator arbitrage. Most people out there don't even know what I mean when I say that. But the fact of matter, I think it makes for a less-than-optimal experience for everyone and when it comes to restaurants, they're just a million substitutes out there. I mean, my Uber shows up and I got to get somewhere. I'm kind of stuck, I got to take the ride. Unless I want to wait another 30 minutes for a lift and they're going to do the same thing to me. But with restaurants, that's a little bit of a different story. You can just go across the street to the Mcdonald's or Burger King and maybe get that.Matthew Argersinger: I guess if you're a customer who values his or her time, I think it makes sense. Imagine like you look at your screen, Starbucks might be example, I get my afternoon coffee at 2 o'clock, I see that there's high demand right now and prices are high I'm going to hold off a bit. Maybe get my coffee at 3 o'clock and watch the app. Prices to go down, I'm I'm buying my latte. I think there's something to it.Jason Moser: As an economics major, I love it. I mean, supply demand, it really warrants, but from a customer experience, certain markets, I don't know that it creates the optimal experience and their goal is to keep people coming back.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, we'll see. Burger futures maybe in heart. Alright, let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Matt you are up first, what are you looking at?Matthew Argersinger: I am looking at eBay ticker, E-B-A-Y. A lot of investors presume that you have to have revenue growth for investments really worked out. But I think there are cases like eBay where you simply you get smart, shareholder-friendly capital allocation. Things can work out. I mean, no one's stealing eBay's growth. I mean, if you look at the most recent quarter, revenue was up just 2%, gross merchandise volume up just 2%, but GAAP earnings of 13.8%, and a big reason for that is buybacks. Ebay made 1.6 billion in share repurchases over the past year and unlike Salesforce, they actually reduce the share count by almost 5%. Over the last five years, eBay's reducing share count by over 40% and they raise their dividend again by 8% and the stock price got a nice bump and I think if eBay can just keeps sales steady, keep it's massive network of buyers and sellers and keep allocating capital in shareholder friendly ways, I think that it's an investment i could really work out. I'm a shareholder,.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about eBay.Dan Boyd: So Matt, you are a known comic book collector?Matthew Argersinger: I am.Dan Boyd: Do you ever use eBay?Matthew Argersinger: I use eBay all the time Dan, buying and selling. So I'm a big power user, but probably makes me biased.Dan Boyd: That's kind of the heyday of eBay in the '90s and early 2000s collectibles. That was a market for it.Dylan Lewis: Alright, Jason, what's on your radar this week?Jason Moser: I've been digging a little bit more into Palo Alto Networks. Ticker is P-A-N-W's. A Palo Alto is a cybersecurity company focused on delivering value in four fundamental areas; it's network security, cloud security, security operations, and then threat intelligence and security consulting. So they really are one of the cybersecurity companies that offers the whole kit and caboodle as they say. Now, I think it's interesting with the company they recently reported earnings, the stock got shellacked. Management pulled back on guidance for the year they cited in the call, I quote, spending fatigue. It's kind of like investments pricing. I mean, its just spending fatigue that raised some eyebrows. Again, it's not new news that enterprise customers are being more mindful of their spending. Cybersecurity is in a little bit of a different bucket, because that really is a non-negotiable, you got to have it this day and age and it's a very competitive space. It was interesting to me also to see Zscalers call a competitor to a degree of Palo Alto. Z-scalar kind of pushing back on that spending fatigue comment, noting they're not really seeing such spending fatigue, yet Zscaler's stock just got pummeled on that earnings release as well. So it could be a little bit of a downtime for the cybersecurity companies right now and in Palo Alto, $100 million market cap company, one that is very important in the space. So learning a little bit more about it and if it's gotta spot in one of my services.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Palo Alto Networks.Dan Boyd: Yeah, Jason, what does Palo Alto Networks doing being headquartered in Santa Clara? It is confusing, isn't it Dan? We really need to straighten them out. I'd imagine it has something to do with with taxes or some sort of little sweetener that the county or city gave them.Matthew Argersinger: Dan, which one's going on your list this week?Dan Boyd: I'm a big user of eBay too. I love buying motorcycle parts from them and with Palo Alto being headquartered in a place that isn't Palo Alto, I don't know if I can accept that kind of thing.Dylan Lewis: Dan doesn't like misrepresentation. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show's mixed by Dan. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

2024-03-09T13:55:00.000Z,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is being supercharged by the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).With the exception of Apple and Tesla, each of these AI stocks has handily beaten the S&P 500 over the last year. Nvidia stands out in a league of its own, however.The stock is up nearly 260% in the last year, and the company has added a trillion dollars of market cap in less than 12 months. With such a meteoric rise, investors may be thinking that they've missed the boat.Let's dig into the current state of Nvidia's business and, more importantly, take a look at what catalysts could be in store for future growth. Now could be as good a time as ever to begin building a position in this monster AI stock.Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) that are used across an array of generative AI applications, including accelerated computing and machine learning. Demand for the company's flagship A100 and H100 chips is staggering, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.Nvidia recently reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. For the full year, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue -- up 126% year over year. But what's even more encouraging is the company's margin expansion and profitability growth. In fiscal 2024, Nvidia's gross margin was 72.7% -- an increase of nearly 16 percentage points over the prior year. On top of that, the company's free cash flow of $27 billion surged sixfold year over year.With a financial performance like this, the music eventually has to stop, right? I wouldn't bank on that just yet.Despite Nvidia's record growth last year, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the ride could just be getting started.Nvidia is expected to increase its top line by roughly 78% this year, followed by modest growth over the next couple of years. Admittedly, forecasting beyond one year can be more of an art than a science. As an investor, I'm not placing too much credence on estimates beyond fiscal 2025.One of the reasons I'm suspicious that the estimates above could be conservative is that investors are now just learning about some intriguing new catalysts. For starters, news broke a couple of weeks ago that Nvidia is an investor in voice-recognition software company SoundHound AI.The terms of the partnership are not entirely known. However, Nvidia is just the latest big tech company to explore AI-powered voice assistants. Cohorts including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all invested significantly in similar technology -- thereby signaling that voice recognition could be a lucrative pocket of the overall AI landscape.In addition, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia also has a budding enterprise software business. While it's still early innings for Nvidia on the software front, I see many reasons to be optimistic about this endeavor. Namely, it shows that the company is already expanding beyond semiconductor chips.Moreover, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware development. Given that competition in semiconductor manufacturing will likely rise over the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin deterioration, as Nvidia will likely lose some of its pricing power.Nevertheless, it appears the company is already looking to outmaneuver such a dynamic by complementing its core data center operation with a software component.During fourth-quarter earnings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement when he declared that ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" On the surface, you might think this means Nvidia's rocket ship may be returning from orbit. But that's not the case.Rather, Huang went on to explain his philosophy in further detail. He believes that the installed base for data center infrastructure could double within the next five years. Given Nvidia's commanding position in this market, combined with the catalysts outlined above, investors have several reasons to believe that there could be substantial upside in Nvidia stock.Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently slapped a $1,400 price target on Nvidia stock -- implying roughly 60% upside from current trading levels. Whether or not Nvidia reaches this price, the bigger picture remains.All things considered, secular trends fueling spend in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to not only stay but actually rise significantly over the next several years. Given Nvidia's unique position across both hardware and software, coupled with an increasing number of use cases and applications, I see Nvidia's growth journey as just beginning.Now could be an interesting time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to build a position or add to an existing holding in Nvidia stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T13:03:38.000Z,12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024. In 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an ""AI cold shower,"" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.A Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.On February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.Some of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.Why is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch.

2024-03-09T12:40:00.000Z,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have been quite successful at incorporating their products and services into the daily lives of billions of people around the world. Over the past few decades, these two tech giants have created things that move the world forward. And their stocks have created plenty of wealth for those smart enough to buy in. For those investors considering getting in on either of these two stocks going forward, the question naturally arises as to which of these two FAANG stocks is the better investment right now. Let's evaluate them based on three important factors and see what conclusions can be reached. An economic moat is a term that represents a trait (or traits) that help a company outperform its competitors in a particular industry. The presence of a moat raises the chances that a business will still be around and thriving well into the future. The bigger the moat, the more successful a company is likely to be long-term.Without a doubt, Apple's main moat stems from its incredible brand strength. Consumers all across the world have no problem spending premium prices to attain the company's various hardware products. This has resulted in one of the most financially successful enterprises on Earth. Its moat helped Apple produce $233 billion in operating cash flow in the last two years (combined).Amazon's key moat source has to be its network effect. As a massive online marketplace that brings together merchants and consumers, the platform improves as it gets bigger. Add on a sprawling logistics network that allows for fast and free shipping on millions of products, and it's hard to see anyone competing effectively with Amazon.Owning businesses that have an economic moat is a good strategy to create a winning portfolio. Both Apple and Amazon have powerful competitive advantages, placing them in a league of their own in this regard.When it comes to future growth potential, Apple gives investors reasons to be cautious. The business reported a 2.8% revenue decline in fiscal 2023, with sales rising by just 2.1% year over year in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). Macroeconomic headwinds might be limiting the propensity of consumers to spend on new hardware devices.Because the iPhone still accounts for more than half of the company's sales, and it is in a very mature stage of its product lifecycle, Apple might not have many growth levers to pull with its current product lineup.As for Amazon, its growth opportunities abound. As the leading platform for online shopping in the U.S., it stands to capture a significant portion of consumer spending that transitions from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce. Related to that online shopping is Amazon's growth potential in digital advertising. It's a relatively new segment for Amazon, but it's generating some of the most significant growth in the company at the moment and has plenty of runway for additional expansion. There's also Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing service provider that controls nearly one-third of the global industry's revenue. AWS' growth has slowed down somewhat in the past several quarters, but management is optimistic about the long-term opportunity. It makes sense why. According to Grand View Research, cloud computing is estimated to be a $1.6 trillion worldwide market by the end of this decade. Amazon is in the best position to benefit.Both Apple and Amazon have wide moats, but the latter clearly has better growth potential in the years ahead. This means Amazon has the lead in this competition thus far.The final factor to consider is the valuation. Here again, the nod goes to the e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut.Amazon trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 today. That's less than half of Apple's P/S multiple of 6.9. The iPhone maker sells at a valuation that far exceeds its trailing-10-year average, while Amazon is roughly in line with its past 10-year P/S ratio. Apple stock is trading at a premium given the market's expectations for future growth.Taking all the information together, Amazon looks like the best stock to buy of these two tech titans.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T11:09:00.000Z,Is It Too Late to Buy Apple Stock?,"By selling some of the most in-demand hardware devices on the face of the planet, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most dominant enterprises out there. Its current market cap of $2.8 trillion attests to this.Unsurprisingly, this FAANG stock has been a massive winner for shareholders. It has skyrocketed 856% in the last decade, crushing the gains of the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500.Is it too late to buy Apple?According to Wall Street analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 4.2% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This would represent a huge slowdown from the 8.4% yearly top-line growth of the past decade. This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone, though.Apple is a gargantuan enterprise today. Management says there are 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, demonstrating the company's ubiquity. It's extremely difficult to continue posting rapid growth on top of a fiscal 2023 sales base of $383 billion.Making matters more challenging is the maturity of the iPhone, Apple's flagship product line, which generated 58% of total company revenue in the last fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30). But with newer upgrades having less game-changing innovations, consumers won't have a problem delaying buying the latest iPhones.Investors will point to the budding services division, which reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. But because this segment relies on more product sales in the first place, its potential is restricted by hardware demand trends.I believe it's totally reasonable to assume that Apple's expansion will be much more muted in the years ahead.Just because growth won't be spectacular doesn't mean this isn't a great business.For starters, Apple possesses one of the most powerful brands in the world. This not only leads to tremendous pricing power and customer loyalty, but it also protects the company from the constant threat of competition. Apple's various offerings are truly differentiated in the industry.Even more impressive is the company's incredible profitability. In the last five years, Apple's operating margin has averaged 27.8%.And generating cash isn't a problem. Apple produced positive free cash flow of $304 billion combined in the last three fiscal years. Management does a great job returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.The balance sheet is in pristine condition. As of Dec. 30, Apple carried $108 billion of debt on the books. That's not a concern at all, given that the business currently has $173 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the asset side.Investors don't need to worry about a potential recession. Apple always seems to operate from a position of strength.It looks like the market is fully aware of just how great this business is. This is indicated by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.8. That's much more expensive than the stock's trailing-10-year average of 21. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.It's best to view things with a fresh perspective. Investors are being asked to pay a premium valuation multiple for a company that is likely to register muted growth going forward. Even if you consider Apple's other favorable qualities, namely the brand and financial picture, I just don't view this as a smart bet to take. This isn't to say that it's too late to buy the stock. My perspective is that Apple would still make for a wonderful investment, just if the P/E ratio came down considerably.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T10:50:00.000Z,"Billionaire Ken Griffin Owns Every Single One of the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks. Should You?","Follow the leader. It's a game most of us played as kids and many still play as adults. In some cases, following the leader might even be a smart investing strategy.Ken Griffin certainly ranks as one of the top leaders in the investing world. His Citadel hedge fund has achieved a level of success that few can match. Griffin's net worth stands at $35.4 billion, a reflection of his company's impressive track record.His Citadel portfolio includes a large number of stocks. Notably, Griffin owns every single one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Should you own them, too?We don't know for sure exactly how much Griffin has invested in the Magnificent Seven right now. However, Citadel's 13F regulatory filing last month revealed how much money the hedge fund had in each of the stocks as of the end of 2023:StockPercentage of PortfolioShares OwnedValue OwnedNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)1.81%3.63 million$1.8 billionMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)1.61%4.24 million$1.59 billionAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)0.95%6.23 million$945.9 millionMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)0.87%2.46 million$869 millionApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)0.4%2.08 million$401 millionAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)0.25%1.79 million$250.9 millionTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)0.09%350.4 thousand$87.1 millionData sources: 13F filings, HedgeFollow.com. All data as of 12/31/23.Griffin's bets on these seven stocks extend beyond direct ownership of shares. Citadel also owned call and put options on Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla at the end of last year.The hedge fund upped its stake in Nvidia by nearly 77% in the fourth quarter of 2023. That bet has paid off nicely, with Nvida's share price skyrocketing in 2024.Griffin also significantly increased Citadel's positions in Amazon, Meta, and Tesla in Q4. Two of those moves have made money, with Amazon and Meta shares jumping close to 15% and 40%, respectively, year to date. However, buying additional shares of Tesla has been a losing proposition for Griffin so far this year.Citadel reduced its stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in Q4. Two of those three decisions have proven to be good ones in 2024, with Apple and Alphabet shares falling. Griffin would have been better off holding onto his Microsoft shares, though, as the tech stock tacked on additional gains since the end of 2023.Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks comes with pros and cons -- like any other stock. The tremendous potential for artificial intelligence (AI) especially stands out as a major plus for all seven of them.The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to power AI apps continues to soar and likely will for the foreseeable future. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet should enjoy strong tailwinds as organizations shift IT spending to the cloud to harness the power of AI.Meta's open-source AI approach could reap huge benefits. And Apple CEO Tim Cook recently confirmed that his company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI with a major announcement likely coming later in 2024.Several of these Magnificent Seven stocks also share a common denominator that's on the negative side: valuation. NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, known by the nickname ""the Dean of Valuation,"" thinks that Nvidia and Microsoft are trading the most above their fair valuations. However, the share prices of Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla are currently below the fair values determined by Damodaran.The relative cheapness of Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla isn't accidental, though. Alphabet had an embarrassing public relations incident with its Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures. Apple's growth has slowed considerably, and Tesla faces intense price competition in China.Following the leader is only smart when the leader is going in the same direction you want to go. For income investors, that isn't the case with Griffin and his Citadel hedge fund -- at least not with the Magnificent Seven stocks. Sure, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia pay dividends. However, their dividend yields are low.Griffin doesn't focus on valuation. While value investors might find some stocks in Citadel's portfolio that are attractive, the group won't include even the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks.Growth investors, on the other hand, should love several of the Magnificent Seven. Keep in mind, though, that exceptionally high valuations could still dampen some of these stocks' growth prospects.The truth is that there's no single right answer to the question of whether or not you should own all of the Magnificent Seven stocks as Griffin does. However, if you're looking for long-term growth, several of these stocks should provide plenty of it.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T10:22:00.000Z,"Beyond Nvidia, these companies are making money from AI","Nvidia Corp.’s growth over the past year has been breathtaking, because the company still has no real competition for graphics processing units that support the data centers that are building capability to support corporate clients’ development of artificial-intelligence technology.Nvidia’s stock completes dramatic reversal lower not seen in almost seven yearsA Palm Springs house sold for $1.3 million in 2023 after zero days on the market — up 113% on its 2021 sale price. It’s now in a $625,000 short sale. How is this possible?‘I’m very sad’: My brother refinanced our mother’s house and sold the contents. Can we claim a share of the proceeds?This isn’t a bull market — it’s a ‘duck’ market. Here’s why.AMD’s AI story is ‘unfolding fast.’ This bull sees a 25%-plus stock gain ahead.But the hardware build-out by Nvidia NVDA and other companies is only one part of the story. What about actual use of the new technology? Jon Swartz talked with industry experts and looked at the companies already making money from generative AI.Nvidia’s stock has soared over the past year, but its rolling 12-month consensus earnings-per-share estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet, has increased much more quickly. This means Nvidia’s forward price-to-earnings ratio has declined dramatically, even as weighted P/E valuations for the S&P 500 SPX and most of its sectors have increased.Here’s a breakdown of that P/E action, including 25 of the best-performing stocks in the benchmark index whose valuations to expected earnings have declined, with Nvidia leading the list.On the other hand: Nvidia’s stock continues to hit new highs. Why that may be ‘a bit unhealthy.’Another Nvidia warning: Cathie Wood sounds warning about Nvidia, whose rally she missedAn associated AI hardware play: Micron’s stock gets new buy call as it is deemed another chip-sector play on AIShares of New York Community Bancorp NYCB closed at $2.73 Monday. The stock was down 73% for 2024, with the slide starting after the bank surprised investors on Jan. 31 with a dividend cut while reporting a net loss springing from higher-than-expected provisions for loan-loss reserves. The bank said it was taking several actions to build capital, in part because it had crossed the asset-size threshold requiring it to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve beginning in April.New York Community Bancorp named Alessandro DiNello as its new chief executive on Feb. 29 and on the same day announced it had discovered ”material weaknesses” in its loan-review processes.On Tuesday, the stock rose 18% to close at $3.22. Then on Wednesday, a deal was announced through which several investment groups, led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s Liberty Strategic Capital investment firm, would invest $1 billion in the bank. The investment included the purchase of newly issued shares at a price of $2, convertible preferred shares with a strike price of $2 and warrants giving the group the option to buy more shares at a price of $2.50.DiNello’s tenure as CEO ended after less than a week, and Joseph Otting was named as the new CEO.Ciara Linnane and Steve Gelsi explained the terms of the deal and the backgrounds of the investors, along with the immediate reaction to the announcement.The Ratings Game: NYCB’s stock stabilizes after turmoil as it aims to build ‘fortress’ balance sheet and calm investorsAfter NYCB provided more details about the transaction during a call with analysts on Thursday, Gelsi provided a further breakdown of deal terms, including a fat 13% coupon on the new investors’ preferred shares.Through Thursday, NYCB’s share price had risen to $3.66, making for a paper gain of 83% for the investor group. And the bank estimated that the deal (excluding the potential exercise of the warrants) would translate to a tangible book value of $6.65 per share. Considering that over the past five years NYCB’s shares have traded for an average of 1.25 times tangible book value, there may be high profit potential for the new investors if they can restore the bank to steady performance.Joy Wiltermuth outlined NYCB’s lingering difficulties with commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans following the deal.As of Thursday’s close, the S&P 500 traded for 20.6 times its weighted aggregate consensus earnings estimate for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That P/E ratio was up from 17.8 a year ago, compared with a five-year average P/E of 19.4, a 10-year average of 18 and a 15-year average of 16.3.There has been a continual flow of warnings about the U.S. stock market being overvalued. Then again, since the S&P 500 is weighted by market capitalization, its high P/E and near-record level can mask greater volatility for many of its component stocks, as Joseph Adinolfi explained.If you believe it is best to move some of your portfolio away from U.S. stocks, it might be time to consider a different market that is cheaply valued. When negative sentiment peaks, the stage can be set for long-term investors to take advantage of low prices.Michael Brush outlined several potential catalysts for China’s stock market, interviewing money managers and suggesting individual stocks and an exchange-traded fund to consider there.More stock-market observations from Joseph Adinolfi:Quentin Fottrell — the Moneyist — visited Palm Springs, Calif., and looked at a house that sold for $611,000 in 2021, then sold for $1.3 million in February 2023 is now listed for $625,000. There are lessons to be learned from this story, along with Fottrell’s usual sound advice.Tough love from the Moneyist:Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL were down 12.1% for 2024 through Thursday, while the S&P 500 was up 8.4% and the U.S. benchmark index’s information-technology sector was up 13.4%, all with dividends reinvested.A sampling of MarketWatch’s coverage can help explain this dichotomy:Related: Rivian looks like it is trying to get Apple’s attentionSigns that a bull market for stocks is heading into a late stage can include a spike in initial public offerings or a perceived decline in quality for newly listed companies.Reddit filed for an initial public offering last month.

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley got his hands on it. So what do you think, Dan?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, that's right, Julie. This is the MacBook Air 15-inch. It is running Apple's new M3 chip. That's the big update here. I also have a cat to my left if you can't see him. He's not as interested in this. He's looking for some food.This basically gets an update as far as the processor goes. The particular one that I have here has an M3 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte storage. That's basically what I think most people are going to end up when it comes to buying something like this. It's going to be a little bit more expensive than the base model. But, you know, the higher you go as far as specs, the longer it's going to last. It's just generally the idea when it comes to computers.So what's difference between this and last year's model? My wife and I actually bought the prior model, the same color and everything. The main difference is it has that M3 chip, which has slightly better performance in the M2 chip found in last year's model.It also has an anodized sealing around the color. This is the midnight color. And you can see some smudging on here. Better than last year's model, though, because whenever we pick it up or my wife picks it up after I use it, it looks like someone rubbed Crisco all over the outside of it.So thankfully, they've tamped down a little bit on the fingerprints. But overall, you know, look, the MacBook Air is one of the best laptops that you can get. It's light, relatively low priced as far as premium laptops go. And the battery just does not stop.I mean, it doesn't matter whether it's the Air or the Pro. I have a Pro from a few years ago that I use for work that I'm connected to right now. Haven't turned it on in two days. Just have-- let it sit. It wasn't turned off, but I just let it sit there. And the battery is still going, enough for me to run everything I need right now to broadcast.So I mean, if you can put that into perspective, the new MacBook Airs are going to last no problem. Apple rates for 18 hours, that's playing back video on iTunes. So don't expect 18 hours. But you'll be able to get through your day and then some. I managed to play a little bit of games on here.The performance is great. The price, again, it's Apple. So it's going to be a little higher, well above the thousand-dollar mark. But as far as overall, this is the best laptop you can buy probably.- Yeah, I mean, I guess the coating is also helpful when the cat walks across that as well.DAN HOWLEY: You need to walk over it.- Yeah. What are we-- do we know anything about what the demand is expected to be like for this?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, well, so the problem that Apple's had with the Macs recently is that they just hadn't updated them, I guess, enough. And so people weren't purchasing them. There was also, don't forget, the whole issue with COVID. As that came in, people started buying products.But Apple, in particular, was hit by a slowdown in sales. Factories have shut down. So then we saw, you know, rather than what we saw with PCs where everything shut up and then went down, Apple was kind of low then shot up later in the pandemic and then started to fall off. So they're on a different cycle than some of the other PC makers out there.But as far as demand goes, anytime there's a new product that comes out, Apple does see a little jump. So for them, the hope is that this will start to send sales of Macs higher for a little bit. The MacBook is really the seller for the Mac line. It's about the laptops. The desktops sell, you know, on their own, sure. But when it comes to the volume, it's really the MacBook. So getting this right, which they did, is incredibly important for that business.- And also there were some news today, some developments with Apple and Epic Games, Dan. Tell us about that.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So the day after-- a few days after we had seen that Apple had pulled Epic's license to develop for Apple's iOS system and put their own App Store into place in the EU and in the EU only-- this is part of that Digital Markets Act-- Apple released a statement saying that they had been working with Epic. And now they're going to allow Epic back in to the developer process.So that means that Epic will be able to put together its own App Store that people will be able to purchase ""Fortnite"" from as well as other Epic Games apps and services. So that's a big move. And it seems to be-- you know, Apple says that it's because they had conversations with Epic.The underlying thinking, though, is that there was some sniffing around by the European Commission, the antitrust arm of the EU. And they're already hitting Apple with a $2 billion fine, which Apple is going to appeal. But less trouble is better.So why not just let in Epic if it's only in the EU? It's not going to be in the UK or the US or anywhere else. So, you know, the Asian countries. It's not going to be the same. So it's probably just the easier path of least resistance for them to just let ""Fortnite"" and Epic back in.- All right. We'll see if that develops differently in other places. Dan, appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apples-m3-macbook-air-top-222734882.html
2024-03-08T21:39:09.000Z,Broadcom Suffers Worst Stock Drop Since 2020 on Slow Chip Sales,"(Bloomberg) — Broadcom Inc., a chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, suffered its worst stock decline in four years after reporting disappointing revenue from its semiconductor business, even as AI demand grew faster than expected.Most Read from BloombergHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear SuppliersChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilStocks Suffer ‘Heat Check’ as Rally Hits a Wall: Markets WrapTSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip PlantChina Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US CurbsThe company’s semiconductor division posted revenue of $7.39 billion in the fiscal first quarter, Broadcom said Thursday, missing the $7.7 billion projected by analysts. Still, the chipmaker remains on track for $50 billion in sales during fiscal 2024, which ends in October. That’s in line with its previous forecast.Though an artificial intelligence boom is fueling demand for Broadcom equipment, the company is contending with slower sales in some segments, such as telecommunications. That’s hurting its chip business. Broadcom’s infrastructure software sales, meanwhile, beat analysts’ estimates.The company’s stock, which had been up 26% this year through Thursday, fell 7% on Friday in New York. That was its biggest single-day drop since March 2020, the early days of the pandemic. Shares of fellow chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. also slid, hurt by a weak forecast. It too has been seen as a beneficiary of AI spending.Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said AI spending would strengthen this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company now expects the demand to account for 35% of its semiconductor revenue in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of 25%.Nvidia Corp.’s stratospheric rise in the past year has sent investors looking for other companies poised to get an AI windfall. Broadcom doesn’t make Nvidia-style chips — ones used to train the large language models that power AI tools — but it does supply vital networking components and handles custom chip design work. That makes it integral to the giant data centers that are processing AI workloads.Despite missing estimates for chip revenue, Tan said demand was strong for its networking products from AI data centers and that large cloud computing providers are clamoring for its custom artificial intelligence chips. They are “driving growth in our semiconductor segment,” he said in a statement.Broadcom’s profit was $10.99 a share in the first quarter, excluding some items. Analysts had predicted $10.42 a share for the period, which ended Feb. 4. Total revenue rose 34% to $11.96 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $11.8 billion.Software demand helped make up for semiconductor sales that were more sluggish than predicted. The infrastructure software division posted revenue of $4.57 billion, beating the $4.33 billion projection. Broadcom has suspended quarterly projections while it integrates and restructures its acquisition of software maker VMware.Broadcom’s Tan has built one of the largest companies in the chip industry through a string of acquisitions. He’s also diversified the business with a push into software — an effort bolstered by the recent purchase of VMware. The integration of that deal will take a year and cost about a billion dollars, including the expense of laying off workers, Tan has said.Broadcom provides key components for Apple’s iPhone, designs custom chips for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and is the biggest supplier of networking components that direct traffic between computers in data centers. During earnings calls, Tan typically gives updates on Broadcom’s at-times contentious relationship with Apple, though he refers to it obliquely as his “North American customer” or another vague moniker.On Thursday, Tan said Broadcom has a “very deep strategic and multiyear relationship” with the customer.—With assistance from Mark Gurman.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/broadcom-expects-ai-demand-help-232417739.html
2024-03-08T21:17:20.000Z,"Apple 'an opportunity' for investors, Boeing 'a value trap'","In the latest segment of Yahoo Finance's ""Good Buy or Goodbye,"" Main Street Research CIO James Demmert joins the Live Show to analyze why investors should consider Apple (AAPL) a buy and steer clear of Boeing (BA).Demmert suggests investors consider Apple stock as a potential buy. He notes that Apple's share price has declined from its highs, stating ""it's getting no love from Wall Street,"" creating ""an opportunity"" for investors. He also highlights Apple's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for its iPhones, which he believes is a strategic ""refocus"" will drive future stock appreciation.On the other hand, Demmert advises investors to avoid Boeing stock. He cites the company's persistent production issues, safety incidents, and manufacturing setbacks, saying Boeing has severely undermined the ""decades [it takes] to build a good reputation."" He also mentions that the valuation has declined significantly, and the company continues to ""lose money.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.Though the broader market has hit record highs in the past few months, not all individual stocks are in positive territory. Some provide great opportunities to buy solid companies at a lower cost. Others are best left alone.I'm here with James Demmert, Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer. Thanks for being here.JAMES DEMMERT: Good to see you, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: So we're talking about two stocks today that are down year-to-date. And let's talk about your buy stock, first of all. And this is one that we have talked about a lot on the program.It's Apple. The shares are down about 10% or so year-to-date. So let's talk about why you still like it. And part of it is because it is down from the highs. So good value right now?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, Julie, it's down from the high. It's getting no love, whatsoever from Wall Street. And, in fact, the short interest, the amount of people shorting the stock has increased quite a bit.And we think that's an opportunity mainly for the underlying things. I think that investors are misunderstanding about Apple. Where are they going really in this what we call the new tech led AI bull market? It looks like they're left behind. But I think investors are mistaking that no, that's coming in the next quarter or two.JULIE HYMAN: OK, so let's dig into that a little bit here because Apple has teased what might be coming here. There's been a lot of focus on some negatives and some perceived negatives like slowing sales in China. But you think that the AI tech is coming. What gives you that confidence?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I think the China sales is moderating, first of all. I think investors should get used to that. And I think that's in the stock price at this point.What we think is exciting-- and if someone missed NVIDIA or any of the semiconductors that have been the really hot stocks that led AI in the first phase. This is where you want to go now because the next phase is where it is AI make a difference. And we think the iPhone is what's going to be carrying AI over the next quarter or 2 and 3.First, it starts with AI subscriptions probably in Q2. I don't think the street is putting that in the price of the stock here. And we think those subscriptions on a $200 million-- or 200 million users can be very significant to earn.JULIE HYMAN: Let me just stop you right there. Because what does that mean? Like meaning there would be something ChatGPT like that Apple is offering as a subscription service on devices?JAMES DEMMERT: Think like a Siri that's really incredible, right? Siri right now is really not incredible. We think that the AI subscription to Apple is going to be that on steroids.So you're really going to be able to talk to your phone. It's going to be telling you what to do in that first phase subscription, of course. Service is good for them. Recurring revenue for a long time. So that'll be the first phase we think that rolls out in Q2.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.JAMES DEMMERT: Q3 is really exciting because that's going to be iPhone 16. We think it's going to be a phone that people are going to need to buy because it's new hardware that can run this AI. So that's another very exciting product cycle.JULIE HYMAN: Well, James, I don't want to hear that because I just bought the 15. But let's get to your last point here, which is sort of the investment strategy and the redeployment of capital. You think that's going to AI just after they, for example, stopped their whole car endeavor.So why was that a good decision? And why is it good what they're doing with that money?JAMES DEMMERT: If you think about Meta, the era of efficiency, reducing costs, I think that's what Apple's doing here. They're saying let's give up on the driverless car in the $10 billion that we threw at that. Let's refocus. Where are they refocusing it? AI.So we think that's a very smart thought process they're going through of, hey, let's think about dollar in dollar out where is going to be most profitable. Really love that they're doing that. Stocks 25 times earnings, right?I think that's wrong. I mean, the PE, right? The E is estimated to be a certain number by the street. We think that E is too low. So the PE today actually may be lower in hindsight as we go forward over the next few quarters.JULIE HYMAN: We always like to put out a potential risk to this upside case. And in the case of Apple, it's that they don't bring this stuff to fruition soon enough.JAMES DEMMERT: That's exactly what the risk is. I mean, I think that if they don't make magic happen in the next few quarters, and I think it's the AI play.The stock definitely will be at risk because then you're going to have the China moderated sales on top of no real reason to get the 16. I think the stock would be in trouble.JULIE HYMAN: OK, gotcha. All right, let's get to your stock that you do not like. It's another one that's down year-to-date. And it's down quite a bit more than Apple. I'm talking about Boeing.Those shares are down more than 20% year-to-date. But you say, no, you don't want to get in here. Let's talk about why.First of all, there's sort of the obvious here. What's been going on production wise at the company?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah, I mean, it takes decades to build a great reputation, Julie. You know that. It takes moments to ruin it. And I think this is what's going on.This is the story with Boeing. And it's really a management problem. They've had mistake after mistake.Some of them the same mistakes over the last two years. And that is really making the institutional investors sort of walk away. And that's why the stock is down.Now, a lot of people think it's cheap because it's down a lot. And we think that is a value trap. And we can talk about valuation in just a moment.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, let's do that then. Let's talk about the valuation.JAMES DEMMERT: You know, here's a company in the last 12 months. That's lost money. I mean, this is an AI-tech led new bull market. That is not really where you want to be.AI can't save their valuation, right? But going forward, the street suggests that you're looking at the price relative to the earnings. You look at that.The streets are estimating the earnings to be at a PE to about 60 times earnings. The S&P 500 is trading at about 21 times earnings. Here's a stock.Three times as expensive as the average company, it's losing money. It's got a real reputation problem. I would stay away from a valuation.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and let's get to the last one here, which is competition. Airbus, of course, its big competitor not suffering from these same issues.JAMES DEMMERT: You know, Airbus has got that reputation down. They've really been able to be very consistent. Now, one problem with Airbus is they're pretty booked for a long period of time.But I think investors should recognize when companies have one of their biggest competitors have a problem like Boeing does, Airbus very well may come out with a new way to produce more planes sooner. So I think that competitive advantage that Airbus has could be a threat to Boeing another reason I don't want to own the stock.JULIE HYMAN: OK, one thing that maybe would draw you in, if the stock kept going down, would it get more attractive?JAMES DEMMERT: I don't want to use the pun-- the plane crashes here. But if the stock crashes, I mean, if the stock literally went down by 50%. I think investors then say, hey, maybe there's value now relative to book value, the amount of the number of the planes, and the future potentially getting brighter. But the stock would really have to come way down and be less than a market multiple.JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. All right, and just to be clear here, you own Apple shares, if I'm not mistaken.JAMES DEMMERT: We own Apple shares as a firm and as my family. Yes.JULIE HYMAN: OK, but you don't own Boeing?JAMES DEMMERT: No.JULIE HYMAN: No? All right, let's summarize what you're telling investors here today, James. By Apple based on its current price, I'd likely blockbuster announcement at some point and solid investment strategy avoid Boeing for its poor management current valuation and potential loss of market share.James, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it.JAMES DEMMERT: Thanks, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: And thank you for watching Good Buy or Goodbye.

2024-03-08T20:56:27.000Z,Apple reverses course and clears way for Epic Games to set up rival iPhone app store in Europe,"Apple has reversed course under regulatory pressure and cleared the way for a nettlesome adversary, video game maker Epic Games, to set up an alternative store for iPhone apps in Europe.The about-face disclosed Friday is the latest twist in a bitter fight between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, over the way iPhone apps are distributed and the fees for digital transactions that occur within them.Apple attributed the change of heart to reassurances from Epic that it won't violate its requirements for getting access to iPhone owners. Epic had brazenly broke the rules in the U.S. in 2020 to trigger an antitrust lawsuit alleging Apple's App Store is a monopoly.After a month-long trial, a federal judge in 2021 rejected most of Epic's claims in a ruling that withstood appeals, but the bickering with Apple has continued.Apple had rejected Epic's attempt to set up an account that would have allowed it to set up an alternative store for downloading iPhone apps — something that Apple has held exclusive control over for more than 15 years.But a new set of regulations called the Digital Marketing Act, or DMA, that took effect in European Union's 27-nation bloc earlier this week cleared the way for other companies to compete against Apple's App Store — an opportunity that Epic was eager to seize upon.Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had alleged Apple’s actions to stymie its efforts to open an app store in Europe were part of its efforts to retaliate against the video game maker for challenging a system that has been a huge money maker for the iPhone maker. Apple collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% for digital transactions completed within iPhone apps, an arrangement that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company while spurring complaints from Epic and other companies who rail against the fees as monopolistic price gouging.European regulators signaled Apple's rejection of Epic's effort to set up an iPhones app developer account in Europe, based in Sweden, might run afoul of the DMA, raising the specter of potentially a substantial fine.Apple didn't mention the regulatory approval in a brief statement saying it is now satisfied Epic will follow all its rules.Sweeney applauded regulators for taking swift action to rein in Apple in a social media post that hailed the outcome as “a big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.”The bad blood between Apple and Epic is far from over. Apple is demanding more than $73 million from Epic to cover its fees in the U.S. antitrust case over the App Store. A hearing on that demand, which Epic has described as outlandish in court papers, is scheduled later this month.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reverses-course-clears-way-205627288.html
2024-03-08T20:03:09.000Z,Fortune 500 list: The top 10 companies dominating business,"This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Fortune 500, a list of the largest U.S companies ranked by revenue. The first edition was published in 1955, with companies like General Motors, Jersey Standard, U.S. Steel, and Chrysler topping the list.Today, a new cast of characters are dominating. In 2023, Chevron secured the 10th spot on the list, bumping off drugmaker Cencora, after the oil company recorded $36.5 billion in profits last year.Here are the top 10 companies from the Fortune 500 list in 2023. Our 2024 list will launch in June.WalmartWalmart raked in over $611 billion in revenue last year to secure the first spot for 11 straight years. The company recently completed a $2.3 billion acquisition of TV maker Vizio, a move that experts say will help the company advertise to customers.The company, headquartered in Arkansas, is run by CEO Doug McMillon and employs over 1.6 million people.The company also bought entrepreneur Marc Lore’s startup, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion in 2016 and is running a pilot of Lore’s latest company, a restaurant concept called Wonder, in one of their supercenters. Walmart plans to open two to three more of Lore’s restaurants in their retail chains this year.As one of several retailers, like Target and Home Depot, to report sales losses due to “shrink,” or inventory loss that includes theft, Walmart has recently posted limitations on self-checkout lines to alleviate shoplifting, which accounted for over $112 billion in industry losses in 2022, according to the National Retail Federation.AmazonAmazon, with a yearly revenue of nearly $514 billion, holds the number two spot on the list for the fourth year.Run by CEO Andy Jassy, the ecommerce giant also offers cloud services and digital advertising along with streaming platforms like Fire TV and Amazon Prime Video. It employs about 1.5 million people. The company has two headquarters in Seattle and Arlington.Amazon has recently announced an investment of more than $10 billion to build data centers in Saudi Arabia to help the country diversify its oil-dependent economy. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp have also invested. Amazon plans to spend $5.3 billion to create new infrastructure in the region to train local developers in 2026.Exxon MobilExxon Mobil brought in a revenue of over $413 billion to take the third spot on the list away from Apple this year. The company moved through the rankings from it’s sixth place spot last year, and could owe its success to a year of record-breaking profits for oil and gas companies in 2022. With CEO Darren Woods at the helm, the company made $55 billion in profits last year and employs over 62,000 people globally. Headquarters are in Houston, Texas.This year, it's been involved in a whirlwind of acquisitions from fracking giants to lithium drilling operations, which the company is investing in to remain an industry leader as consumers shift to electric cars. At the end of last year, Exxon Mobil announced plans to drill for lithium in southern Arkansas and expects to produce the material, which is critical for electric vehicles, by 2027.AppleIn 2023, Apple dropped to fourth place on this list, but it still holds the title for most profitable company on the Fortune 500—a title it’s held for eight years.The company, with Apple Park as its headquarters in Cupertino, California, is run by CEO Tim Cook and employs about 161,000 people and generates revenue from key products like the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and software platforms like iOS.Apple recorded more than $394 billion in revenues in 2023. It’s had a rocky year with regulators–it was fined $2 billion by the European Union’s antitrust commission over a complaint brought by Spotify stating that the company refuses to let streaming services inform iOS users of cheaper off-platform subscriptions, which in turn creates a barrier to competition in the digital music market.In a statement, Apple has said the Commission failed “to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm,” and accused Spotify of “coordination with the European Commission.”UnitedHealth Group With a revenue of over $324 billion, UnitedHealth Group is the highest-ranking healthcare company on the Fortune 500 list. It maintained the fifth spot on the ranking for a third straight year.The company, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is run by CEO Andrew Witty and employs about 400,000 people to develop health technology, financial services and pharmacy services.In February, the U.S Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the company as part of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts against some of the biggest American companies, including Apple, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.CVS HealthCVS has brought in over $322 billion in revenue this year and fell from number four to number six on the list last year. The group’s CEO Karen Lynch tops Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in Business list for the third year in a row. Her aspirations for the company, she told Fortune, are expansive.With a headquarters in Rhode Island, the company employs about 300,000 people and generates most of its revenue from healthcare benefits and pharmacy services.In the next few years, she said, there will be “unprecedented change, more change than probably the last 50 years.” Some of those changes include the company’s overhaul of its prescription drug pricing model, which it announced  in December, and could help customers save money on drugs. The company announced it will roll out a new reimbursement model that aims to make drug costs more predictable and offer cash discount cards in the coming years.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet’s multinational holding company holds spot number seven on the list for the second year in a row with a reported revenue of over $302 billion dollars.Berkshire Hathaway, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, employs about 396,000 people and owns businesses in insurance, rail transportation, energy generation and distribution, and manufacturing and retail sectors. It’s also a large stakeholder in American companies like American Express and Coca-Cola.In February, the company’s stock hit a brief record high with a valuation of $1 trillion.Alphabet Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Microsoft Corp, generated over $282 billion in revenue last year to secure its number eight ranking on the list. The two companies have been on the forefront of AI development, and lately, have been cracking down to moderate the software, too.Headquartered in Mountain View, California and run by CEO Sundar Pichai, the company employs about 182,500 people and leverages its search, web browsing, advertising and cloud computing to generate money. Its revenues from Google Cloud have also been growing rapidly.In March, Google announced in a blog post that it plans to reduce spam, low-quality and unoriginal content in search results by 40%, after complaints surfaced that Google’s search engine results are filled with spam.McKessonThis medical supplies company earned nearly $264 billion in revenue last year to secure spot number nine on the list, the same spot it held last year. It’s one of the lesser known companies on the top 10 of the Fortune 500 list, but its CEO Brian Tyler spoke to Fortune on some of the hallmarks of his four-year tenure.Headquartered in Irving, Texas, employs over 80,000 people and generates revenue through pharmaceutical distribution, wholesale medical supplies, and pharmacy technology services.ChevronWith about $246 billion in revenue, Chevron closes out the list at spot number 10. The company’s revenue climbed about 52% last year due to rising oil prices, and has been investing in a number of initiatives this year, from green hydrogen plants to buying South American acreages for petroleum.With a headquarters in San Ramos, California, and CEO Mike Wirth leading the company, it employs about 45,600 people and sells crude oil and natural gas.In March, Chevron bought a stake in acreage offshore Uruguay and joined several other industry companies with interest in South America’s potential for oil discoveries. This month the group also shuttered its operations in biodiesel plants in Iowa and Wisconsin.The group recently announced ambitious plans to construct a green hydrogen facility in southern California, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2026, and will harness energy from an existing 29-megawatt solar energy array to generate hydrogen. Chevron intends to use ""non-potable"" water, a non-drinkable by-product of its oilfield operations, for its green hydrogen facility.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/fortune-500-list-top-10-200309643.html

2024-03-08T19:18:57.000Z,Apple backs down on EU ban for ‘Fortnite’-maker Epic Games,"Apple has abruptly reversed a decision to ban Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” from launching its own app store on iOS in Europe — just a day after European Union officials said they were investigating the matter.It’s the first major test of Europe’s new digital competition rules that went into force on Thursday, and it highlights how the Digital Markets Act may already be having an impact on consumers just a day after going into effect.Apple relenting means Epic will be able to bring “Fortnite” back to iPhones in Europe, Epic said in a blog post. “Fortnite” has been unavailable on iOS since 2020, when the two companies went to war over Apple’s developer terms.“Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,” Epic wrote.Apple said it reached the decision “following conversations with Epic” in which Epic committed to following Apple’s new EU-focused policies.“Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program,” Apple said in a statement.The move comes after the European Commission said it had requested information from Apple about the latest allegations — and after a top EU commissioner, Thierry Breton, warned on X “there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers” and identified Epic’s complaint as an issue of “priority.”The new EU DMA requires app stores to allow app downloads from third-party sources. Apple’s solution to the rule is a system allowing developers to create all-new iOS apps that act as self-contained app marketplaces.In its complaint to the European Commission, Epic accused Apple of yanking its approval of a developer account because of Epic’s past history of criticizing the iPhone maker. Another alleged reason for revoking the account was Epic’s deliberate, previous violation of Apple’s terms — in order to call out what Epic said was anticompetitive behavior by Apple.Emails that Epic published on Wednesday appeared to bolster those claims, showing Apple leaders telling Epic they expected the company to intentionally breach Apple’s store terms again. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote back to Apple promising to abide by its terms, but Apple rescinded the developer account anyway.In a statement after the emails were published, Apple publicly justified the move by referencing US court rulings that affirmed Apple’s right to terminate Epic’s accounts for any reason.Now, however, Apple appears to have relented in the face of pushback by EU officials — paving the way for Epic, and “Fortnite,” to again become available to players on iOS in Europe.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-backs-down-eu-ban-191857390.html
2024-03-08T19:06:44.000Z,Apple Reverses Move to Ban ‘Fortnite’ Maker From the EU,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., facing mounting pressure from regulators in the European Union, has reversed a decision to ban Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. from offering its own iPhone app marketplace in the region.Most Read from BloombergThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy ExpatsBillions Pour Into Nigeria as Tinubu’s Reforms Start to Pay OffIs Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin?Slow US Inflation Retreat Is Set to Bolster Fed Patience on Rate CutsThe $1 Trillion Race to Rebuild Ukraine Is Slowly Getting GoingApple will restore a developer account for Epic’s Sweden division, letting the games company move ahead with plans for building its own EU app store. Apple is required to allow rival marketplaces on its platform under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which took effect this week.Epic, based in Cary, North Carolina, announced the move in a blog post Friday.“Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account,” Epic said. “This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable.”The turnabout comes just a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker. Apple had banned the still-new Epic Games Sweden AB account earlier this month following criticism from Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney. Sweeney had taken issue with how Apple was complying with the new DMA law, calling it “hot garbage” and a “horror show.”Epic needs the developer account to launch apps in the region and go ahead with its app marketplace, which will serve as as a substitute for Apple’s App Store. Until now, the iPhone maker hasn’t permitted the downloading of apps outside its marketplace — a process known as side loading. Apple typically charges a commission of 15% to 30% on purchases within its App Store.“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies,” Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement Friday. “As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”EU official Thierry Breton “noted with satisfaction” on the social media site X that Apple had backtracked on the decision.Epic’s developer account had already been banned by Apple in the US and elsewhere since 2020, when Epic bypassed Apple’s payment system to sell in-app upgrades to users. That set off a long conflict between the two companies, ultimately resulting in Apple and Epic going to court. Apple mostly prevailed, but was forced by a judge to make it easier for developers to point customers to outside payment methods for in-app purchases.After detailing its plans to comply with new EU regulations earlier this year, Apple moved to mend fences by granting Epic’s Sweden division a developer account in the EU.But tension flared again. Sweeney complained about new fees that Apple was imposing as part of its DMA compliance, suggesting that it wasn’t following the spirit of the new law. Late last month, Apple App Store chief Phil Schiller complained to Epic about Sweeney’s remarks.“Your colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan, coupled with Epic’s past practice of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules,” Schiller said in an email to Sweeney that was later disclosed by Epic. “In plain, unqualified terms, please tell us why we should trust Epic this time,” Schiller wrote.Then, on March 2, Epic’s developer account was banned. Apple defended the move on Wednesday, saying it had the right to terminate Epic entities from its platform. It cited court determinations that the game maker had committed an “egregious breach of its contractual obligations” and Apple had the right to ban the new account “in light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior.”But after EU regulators and iPhone app developers pushed back against what appeared to be a retaliatory move, Apple reversed course. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion for allegedly harming Spotify Technology SA and other music services in the EU — and the company likely didn’t want to incur more penalties.It’s unclear what this means for Epic and Fortnite potentially being restored to Apple’s iOS platform outside of the EU.(Updates with Thierry Breton post in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reverses-move-ban-fortnite-190644428.html

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst Jason Moser. Jason, how's your Monday going so far?Jason Moser: So far, so good, Deidre. Beautiful weather here in Northern Virginia and just another good reminder that spring is right around the corner.Deidre Woollard: It is indeed. If it's not maybe the best Monday in the world for Apple, one of the most interesting stories out today is about this $1.8 billion euro fine from the European Commission leveled at Apple. What's happening here is the European Commission says Apple really kept users from learning about other music apps, which led to consumers paying higher prices. Not the first time we've heard this about the App Store, is it?Jason Moser: No, it's not. We'll get to the gate-kept part of the story here momentarily, I'm sure. But you're right and this is something that as Apple gets bigger, the drumbeat for this only grows louder. I think many will call this the fight for more open internet for consumers. think most of us are on board with that. I think the big picture that's probably the right side on which to be and Apple seems to be pushing against that narrative a little bit, so it doesn't really look good. The optics don't really look that great for them in that regard. One of the things that really stood out to me, the response to the fine Apple said Spotify stands to gain the most from this E.U. pronouncement. I don't know, to me, I feel like the longer-term implications of something like this, consumers by far and away have more to potentially gain from something like this. I understand Apple needs to defend itself and they will at virtually any cost that we've seen, but this is clearly something that's not going to go away. My guess is they're seeing the writing on the wall, where the trend, where the puck is headed here. It's not necessarily in favor of Apple at this point.Deidre Woollard: No, and it's interesting because Apple will tend, usually to take a very neutral response to these things. I felt like their reply was not very neutral. They took aim at Spotify. They said, Spotify has benefited from Apple's reach. Then they paid nothing. It's going to appeal. This isn't over by a long shot, but basically, it sounds like they feel Spotify was not going behind their back, but certainly very [laughs] deeply involved with the European Commission in everything that led to this outcome.Jason Moser: Spotify definitely, they didn't just let things play out. They were very much on top of this one. They never really let it go. They absolutely really paid attention to this ruling and fought for this outcome and it makes sense. There's no question Spotify has benefited from being on Apple's platform. That's not really the point, though. I think ultimately the point, when you look at it from the bigger picture is, getting back to that gatekeeper mentality. There was a point where you see a company like Apple wielding so much control over everything that's going through that walled garden, so to speak. Weird point. I trust regulatory concerns are out there abound. It's very hard to imagine that this is not something that will continue to gain steam here. Spotify right now, they have a greater-than-50% share of Europe's music streaming market. That's more than double their closest competitors. When you look at Spotify, compare it to Apple, Spotify is clearly winning on the streaming-music front, but it's important to note to Apple as a competitor in this space, that Apple competes with their own music-streaming service I think makes this hurdle a little bit more difficult for them to clear.Deidre Woollard: It's interesting to see the way that the App Store has evolved because when you think about it in the beginning when we first had the iPhone, it made sense to have this central location for security's sake, as Apple has said to make sure that everything met certain expectations and of course, if you had a physical store and you had people selling goods in it, you would charge rent, you would want to be compensated. All of that made sense in the beginning, but now we've got all of these larger movements that are happening. Rules are changing country-by-country. I do believe it's better for the consumer in the long run, but it also seems this is becoming a really chaotic and confusing experience.Jason Moser: Well, it is. Actually, ironically enough, that could work out in Apple's favor over the longer haul. I absolutely understand Apple's perspective that hey, we can run this App Store. We can make it the most efficient. We can give people the best experience, we can make it the most secure. I think where a lot of people would push back on I think this is where this is going is ultimately that there aren't any other choices. Just Spotify, for example, in order to subscribe to Spotify, fairly certain you have to do that through the web operating system. You can't do that through mobile. Then Apple going back to that, Spotify had to pay anything for benefiting from being a part of our ecosystem. That is true to the degree if you want to subscribe to Spotify, I believe the only way to do that is through the web interface. Listen to me, that is something I think that as time goes on, we're only going to see consumers more and more choice. That seems to be the trend in however this stuff plays out. Ultimately, consumers want more choice and that's what this all boils down to. I think that's why this put Spotify and any other company that's going to join in on this in a little bit of a better spot here because again, Apple has gotten so big. It's not saying we don't want to have that Apple option out there. We just want more choice. Now a lot of consumers will look at that and say, you know what, that's fine. I'm glad I have that choice, but the Apple experience is just far better and I'm happy to deal with that Apple experience. A lot of people love that Apple ecosystem and want to stick with it. But I think ultimately at the end of the day, it really just boils down to choice. Typically, I think having more choice tends to win out.Deidre Woollard: Well, speaking of more choice, I want to pivot to another story which is essentially about choice in a way which is that JetBlue and Spirit are calling off their merger. This is not a big surprise because there's a choice that you hear, too. A federal judge had blocked the deal after the Justice Department said it would be anti-competitive. Spirit really, they needed this deal. They had to deal with Frontier before JetBlue got involved and obviously, that fell apart. You've got this company, they've got a large amount of debt. Travel is still good. People joke about Spirit, but they still fly in it. It's cheap. It's an adventure, but it can be worth it. But I'm worried about this company. If part of the idea here was to keep choice open and to keep our options open for consumers, if this company falls apart, that doesn't seem like it's good for consumers.Jason Moser: Well, this is a bit of a conundrum and I'm glad you brought up the Frontier thing. I wonder if we won't see the idea of some partnership or merging with Frontier. I've wondered if we won't see that come back into play here. Obviously, not surprising, the writing was on the wall here. But when you look at JetBlue and Spirit, I agree with you. Spirit much more needed this. JetBlue didn't need this, Spirit really needs this. But when you have to discount airlines, I absolutely understand the concern of combining them ultimately making a little bit more difficult for the price-sensitive consumer. I think that probably makes sense in that regard. I think this speaks to the difficulties in running a business like this. Airlines as we know, very difficult line of work. We've talked about this before. You go back to that 2007 Warren Buffett wrote in one of his letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The quote, ""If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done a successors a huge favor by shooting Orvell down."" He just wasn't really isn't the biggest fan of airlines. That still doesn't even keep him away. He still goes back to the well every once in a while. But this just really puts Spirit in a difficult spot, speaking of choices, they don't have a ton of choices right now. When you look at the capital position they are in, they have a ton of debt on the balance sheet. They've 8% secured notes that are due in September 2025 to the tune of $1.1 billion and this company's financials are just hemorrhaging cash. This really puts them on the clock. They're going to have to figure out a way to shore up their balance sheet. They get I think $69 billion from the termination of this deal, but that really is just a drop in the bucket compared to their bigger-picture problems. I'd have to imagine the executive team at Spirit right now is working around the clock trying to figure out how to deal with this.Deidre Woollard: Well, on the other side of this, I want to look at JetBlue, too, because their stock went up after this was announced. They're not in danger there, back to business. But I was thinking about this and then about their partnership with American Airlines that was deemed anti-competitive. Are there some strictures on how big JetBlue can be? It's always been smaller compared to the big airlines. It was going to try to use either the collaboration with American or the acquisition of Spirit to grow. Now it's struck out twice. What does that mean for the company in terms of how it thinks about growth?Jason Moser: Well, I think that given the market on which they focus, very value-oriented offering, that is just going to limit the market opportunity in general. They are a portion of that overall airline market. It's not to say they can't do a great job in that space. It may limit exactly how much they can grow, but they could still go in there and really own that space. I think that for JetBlue at least they can get back, focus on what they do well. This isn't something that ultimately puts them behind the ball in any fashion. They can get back to really focusing on serving the customers that they know how to serve. If they come up with some ideas of perhaps expanding beyond that value offering then that potential will certainly exist. But again, like you said before, this is something where Spirit is absolutely feeling this one more so than JetBlue ever will.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to go to one more story that you and I have talked about before. This is the ongoing saga of, is Macy's going to go private? [laughs] It's an interesting one because Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital, they upped their offer from $21 to $24 a share, values the company around $6.6 billion. Current market cap is just under five. It is an interesting time for them to up the offer because last week, Macy's announced they're closing around 150 stores in the next couple of years. They're restructuring, it's obvious that things quite aren't working. Both Arkhouse and Brigade noted the plan failed to inspire investors. A little bit of an understatement there. If I'm a shareholder, I'm probably asking myself, is there any way the company can do better than this offer via performance? I'm not sure I see the path. What do you think?Jason Moser: I think that's the right question to be asking yourself and I think the answer is very clearly, no, this is as good as it's going to get. If I'm a shareholder of Macy's, which I'm not and I never have been, but if I were a shareholder, I would be absolutely voting in favor of this and I probably wouldn't even be wasting time worrying about the vote. I would probably go ahead and just be selling my shares, taking advantage of this bump on the raise of this offer because like you said, we talked about Macy's before, the challenges that they've they've had. There are plenty of concerns with a business like this. Obviously, this is a business playing defense. They are absolutely not playing offense. They're not looking for ways to grow. They're really looking for ways to whittle down the cost structure and find a way to be more efficient. Operating margins have been cut by more than half over the last 10 years. Talk about financials hemorrhaging. This is another company, financially speaking, it's just not in a very good position. Again, back to playing defense and there are clues out there that tell us there may not necessarily be a need for Macy's in this world. I'm not calling Macy's JCPenney, but I am saying that we watched this happen in real time at JCPenney.We watched investors get in there and try to take advantage of the opportunity to see if they couldn't turn things around, fix things. Ultimately, you have to ask yourself the question, in this day and age, is Macy's something necessarily that the world needs? I would argue, need, no, maybe there's a want there, but it feels to me like the want is going to ultimately manifest itself in a smaller footprint. That's OK. Macy's can exist, albeit a little bit smaller than it does today, but if that's the case, then clearly shareholders today don't want to be on that ride. We invest for growth, we invest for reliability, dividends, things like that, and Macy's right now, not in a position really to offer investors that case. To me, this is one of those things we take advantage of the opportunity you have in front of you here. Honestly, like we see all the time. When private equity gets involved with things like this, ultimately, a lot of cases, they end up spnding these companies back out to the public markets anyway. There are a bunch of Macy's loyalists out there. Hey, listen, maybe you don't have to wait long. It'll come back around as perhaps a little more of a realistic opportunity.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what it becomes on that side. But you just mentioned selling because this has -- this had me thinking a little bit about any time I see news about a company I'm invested in, if there's a potential merger or a takeover or anything like that, I always wonder, when do you know when the moment is to say, OK, this is going to be great, I should stay here, or no, this is going to look weird? What kind of questions do you ask yourself?Jason Moser: That's a really valid concern. It really is just it's looking at that company, looking at the thesis that your investment was based on from the very beginning. You could invest it in something like Macy's with a value thesis, not necessarily a growth thesis. You go into something like a Macy's and say, well, I feel like it's undervalued, I'm going to buy shares today, and when it reaches this intrinsic valuation that I've determined then I'm going to sell shares versus something where you feel like you're investing in a business that you want to own for the next 10, 15, 20 years because you feel like there's a growth opportunity there. I think ultimately, it's understanding that perspective of why did you invest in the business in the first place? What is the ultimate end game there? Then figuring, well, what's the upside from where we are today? I think you look at Macy's, for example, and you think, well, there's probably not a ton of upside at this point. But you look at other companies out there that may still have years upon years of growth in front of them. Even if they're suffering from some unforced errors, you can still overcome that, things can change. Macy's, I think, is a good example of a business where maybe we've seen they've tried to change, they've tried to improve the situation, but the market dynamics, just the nature of the market that they serve just makes it very difficult to do so.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, it seems like we've seen what we're going to see with that one.Jason Moser: Yeah. Very well said.Deidre Woollard: Thanks for talking with me today, Jason.Jason Moser: Thank you.Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on this show, but it's just a peek at The Motley Fool's investing universe.

Motley Fool contributor Lou Whiteman joined my colleague Ricky Mulvey to talk about the state of air travel and some literal radar stocks.Ricky Mulvey: We were going to check in on some airlines, but before that, I often hear that this is an industry that retail investors should just stay away from. They've got uncontrollable oil prices driving business cycles. They're very mature, they're hard to scale. There's fairly low switching costs for customers. Got a lot of pensions you gotta pay for. Why are these companies worth investors' attention? We're going to do some bull cases. Why are we focusing here?Lou Whiteman: Yeah, I'll put it into words of Warren Buffett. He once said that if there had been a capitalist back at Kitty Hawk, that person would have done the world a favor if they just shot they experiment down. That's what Warren Buffett feels about the airlines and historically going all the way back to the late 1970s deregulation, this has been a tough industry to invest in. Every time we had a down cycle, we know the names: Braniff, TWA, Eastern, airlines just went out of business. I will say at the risk of saying it's different this time. We've had a lot of consolidation starting in say, 2007-2008. We've built up a big four of United, Delta, American, and Southwest. They are better able to control costs now because they have some pricing power. I think the days where companies go out of business when times get bad are over. It still is a cyclical business that even in the best of times has low margins, so investors have to be careful here. But for maybe the first time since the late '70s, there is a case for buying airlines because they're just better-run companies than they used to be.Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, instead of the Fed backstop, what we saw in the pandemic is a congressional backstop for a lot of these companies. There seems to be too big macro forces hitting these airlines at the same time. One is that a lot of the margin that airlines made was on business travel and that doesn't appear to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels. There's some of it returning, but Zoom has been adopted and it's, it's hard to convince companies to open up their budgets for a lot of those sales meetings. There's also a greater interest in traveling abroad. More flights to Central America from North America, for example. There's the well-wrought story of revenge travel. How are airlines responding to these trends? Are there any that are performing a little bit better than others?Lou Whiteman: Definitely, historically, the big three now, Delta, United, and American, who are left, they made their money off business travel. That has changed, and you're right, business travel has lagged as in terms of recovery. It's less of a big deal than it would have been because of a lot of the changes in the way airlines price. They're a lot smarter about pricing, there's a lot more technology in pricing. But yes, this industry is at its best when business travel is flourishing. I do think it's coming back. Zoom has taken over some meetings, but in a work-from-home world, you do come check-in sometimes and it creates new opportunities. The way the industry has thrived the last few years, though, is this pent-up demand for tourism travel and for vacation travel. If you've traveled last few years, you know, airports are full, planes are full, they have great pricing power. They're using their technology to price each seat and maximize revenue. A lot of us, myself included, have been surprised at how well that trend has continued even as things have gotten a little shakier in other areas to the extent that it continues. These companies are looking at a strong 2024. However, we don't know how long it holds out this time and it would be nice to have that business cushion, that higher-margin, less price-sensitive fare to fall back on. The companies do hope we do see at least a return to trends, if not growth in that area.Ricky Mulvey: I think you're also going to see while business travel may return, it may not necessarily mean that businesses are going to pay for business class, especially as there's wide company meetings where everybody's getting together once a quarter, that kind of thing where there's, let's say, a high-level salespeople are jet-setting and in traveling business whenever they like.Lou Whiteman: Just real quick on that. Look at how smart they've been in recent years. If you've flown, you know there's economy plus, there's economy of leg room, you pay extra for a window seat. So yeah, we don't have that delineated first-class, business class, and coach but they are finding more ways to extract additional revenue out of each seat on the plane with some of these economy-plus features so that has helped the offset at least.Ricky Mulvey: The big story of this year for the airlines has been the attempted mergers and in most cases, them getting blocked. You had a JetBlue and Spirit which we've covered a bit on this show. Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines, which were two smaller regional players and I think that surprised some market observers. There's also this story that we haven't talked about with Delta and Aeromexico. We were chatting in Slack about this. You said this was fascinating and I didn't ask you why because I wanted to save it for this. Basically, the airlines had a joint partnership, which the Department of Transportation is unwinding. Let's first get into the argument to break these companies up. This is not something that I heard a lot of people calling for.Lou Whiteman: Let's step back here because I think it is interesting. It talks about how these airlines are trying to position themselves. In most countries, the United States included, there's a cap on foreign ownerships. You can't do cross-border mergers and acquisition in this industry. Contrast that with the need by airlines to get their customers, especially business customers, access to the globe. You can't buy foreign competitors. You don't want to fly a plane to every airport on the face of the Earth. That's why we have these huge alliances. You've seen them on the side of planes: SkyTeam, Oneworld, Star Lines. This is a way to connect your customer to wherever they have to go around the globe. Problem with alliances, though, is it's pretty easy to break one alliance and go into another. Delta was on the forefront here of trying to make equity ties by minority stakes in key partners. They did it with Virgin Atlantic, they did with Aeromexico, they did it with LATAM, where they're trying to forge permanent ties short of a merger. The downside of that is that it opens yourself up to more regulation on these alliances because there's money involved, there's equity involved. Delta and Aeromexico, two strong partners. This is an area where Delta desperately needed a partner. American Airlines with its hubs in Phoenix and hubs in Dallas, they have Mexico covered. United which has always had a strong presence there. Delta needed a partner. They have an arrangement with Aeromexico and yeah, now suddenly a couple of years in, after it was approved, regulators are having second thoughts.The backstory here is, is a lot of this is a dispute between the United States officials and Mexican officials over a new airport in Mexico City. The president of Mexico opened up a second airport. Mexico City International is one of the biggest in the world, but a new, smaller Felipe Angeles International Airport. He put a lot of money into it. Not a lot of people are flying there. Mexican government has decided that a lot of U.S. airlines, especially cargo airlines, will be required to use that new airport. United States isn't happy with this, Department of Transportation. In part, they are targeting this Delta-Aeromexico to try to get leverage to reopen negotiations on this. It could still happen. It could happen that Delta and Aeromexico have to unwind. They have until October. If I was to be a cynic and Ricky, I'd never be a cynic with you, but I can't help but wonder if closer to that date if we'll see some movement on the airport issue, and then maybe that will be movement on this Delta-Aeromexico partnership. But if it does happen and it is scheduled to happen now by the end of the year, that would be a blow to Delta. Not a fatal blow, but that would be bad news for Delta.Ricky Mulvey: Is that why you don't think Delta shareholders seem to mind as right now, it's maybe some political puffery, if you will?Lou Whiteman: I think there's a lot of that. Mexico is a very important destination. Delta will still fly to major cities. They are going to lose by their estimate, it would cancel nearly two dozen routes. They would lose access to some second-tier Mexican markets. It's not the end of the world, even an important market, if you lose access to second-tier cities in a foreign market. How material would it be? I don't think it would be significantly material. It would be a blow to their business and their aspirations to grow in the region. But I don't think it's a thing that investors need to lose sleep over.Ricky Mulvey: Well, I'm not losing any sleep. Let's wrap up. I hope Dylan forgives me for stealing this from the Friday show. But let's do some literal radar stocks. I know you've got three. What are some airline stocks that investors should put on their radar?Lou Whiteman: I'm breaking this down into three categories here. If you want, slow and steady and as we said at the top, I do think it's a safer environment to be a long-term investor in airlines, Delta leads this revolution. They are well managed. They are the ones that came up with this new pricing scheme they've tried, with some success but sometimes not success to spread themselves internationally with these investments. Delta is just a forward-thinking, well-run company with good hubs. They have a better labor situation than most of their rivals. Delta is a reliable company to buy and I think my favorite of the big four. If you want a little more risk but with some growth upside, there's a company out of Denver called Frontier. ULCC is the ticker there. They are the best potential growth story in this industry. It's a model not everyone likes. It's the pay-for-everything model but it is popular in Europe. It's growing popular in the U.S. They have a huge order book of planes. If it goes to script and if management is ever able to do what they want and there is more risk here that is an if, but they are the best potential for five to 10 years out significant growth to the company and hopefully that would mean significant growth to the stock there.That's your better, more risk, more reward candidate. Then the other option is, and this is the one personally Ricky, I've taken, I believe in the long-term growth of global air travel. You have a rising global middle class, you have people, hopefully, I think permanently prioritizing experience over maybe material goods. There is a lot of demand out there around the globe for air travel. It's hard to buy into that by buying just one airline stock. But there's a company called AerCap that I know is a Fool favorite. What they do is they finance planes. They buy planes directly from Boeing and Airbus and they lease them to the airlines. AerCap right now is my favorite way to get exposure to this -- what I think is a sustained multidecade trend toward more travel without taking all of the single-company risk and single-geography risk that comes with buying an airline.Kind of a wild card, kind of cheating because it's not an airline but that's one to look at if you are a believer in these trends and maybe don't want to settle up with just one carrier.Ricky Mulvey: If you have an issue with Lou Whiteman cheating on his three airline radar stocks, our email is podcasts@fool.com, podcasts with an s @fool.com.

2024-03-11T05:59:58.000Z,EU's Digital Markets Act hands boost to Big Tech's smaller rivals,"By Foo Yun Chee and Martin CoulterBRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.The DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.The sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.""The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,"" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.For example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.In practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.Meta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.Similarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.""The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,"" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.Google said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.Consumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.For example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.APP STORE WARSWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.Apple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.Under the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.Apple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.Apple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.The implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.Fortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.The Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alison Williams)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/eus-digital-markets-act-hands-161244160.html
2024-03-08T16:29:13.000Z,Nvidia on cusp of overtaking Apple as second-most-valuable company,"By Medha Singh(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.An AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.Nvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.The relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.Nvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.""Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,"" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.""It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.""Meanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.In recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.The stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.By comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.""Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the ""AI narrative"" stocks out there,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.""We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.""However, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.Over the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.""Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,"" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/nvidia-cusp-overtaking-apple-second-160413392.html
2024-03-08T14:45:23.000Z,12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024,"In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024. Stocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a ""Goldilocks"" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.The 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February ""60 Minutes"" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts. The stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an ""overbought"" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains ""overbought"" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of ""overbought"" for three consecutive months or more.BofA analysts commented: ""A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.""Some of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our Methodology We scanned The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's holdings that seeks to track the investment results of S&P Total Market Index, which is composed of U.S. equities.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).In September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

2024-03-08T13:50:20.000Z,Jim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s 5 Latest Stock Picks This Week.Jim Cramer in his latest program talked about the ever-growing appetite for semiconductor chips in the market, demonstrating the enormous gains of semiconductor ETFs, in addition to semiconductor stocks like Nvidia, which Cramer yet again called the “undisputed” leader of the industry.While Cramer said semiconductor chips have seen a huge improvement in their performance over the past few months, there’s another kind of chips that is the epitome of the inflation crisis. You guessed it right, Cramer is talking about potato chips. Cramer said a standard bag of potato chips has seen a 45% jump in price over the last few years, but the quality and quantity of these chips remained the same. Cramer said the rise in food prices after the pandemic has been disastrous for Americans. Cramer said not everybody could invest in stocks like Nvidia because of the burden of food prices and no extra income. But for those who can, which Cramer called the “haves”, the rise in food prices amounts to “nothing” because of the riches they are making in the stock market. Cramer said that’s the “beauty” of investing.Jim Cramer drew an interesting contrast between two factors to demonstrate the forces at work when it comes to the demand of semiconductor chips and potato chips. Cramer said the launch of ChatGPT infused a generative AI revolution which is behind the insatiable demand of semiconductor chips. Companies like Meta Platforms are gobbling up hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s expensive chips to power their generative AI systems. On the other hand, in the healthcare industry, top American companies are working on weight loss drugs which are also known as GLP-1. These drugs increase willpower and diminish cravings and temptation of tasty but unhealthy foods like potato chips.Cramer said the “paths” of people who invested in microchips and those who buy potato chips are very different and perhaps would never meet.In addition to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer loves, there are some new names he recommended this week. In this article we will talk about these new stock picks of Jim Cramer.For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC aired this week and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 19Jim Cramer was recently asked during his program about Powell Industries, Inc (NASDAQ:POWL). The questioner said the stock is already up about 100% year to date. Cramer said “it’s not done” as he thinks the stock has more room to run. Cramer said Powell Industries, Inc (NASDAQ:POWL) is a “just a really good company” and it reminds him of Eaton Corporation which Cramer’s charitable trust owns. Jim Cramer said he wish the stock would come down a bit so he could “put it in” his charitable trust’s portfolio.Liberty Park Capital Management made the following comment about Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) reported another quarter of better-than-expected earnings and bookings.

Cramer said he agrees with a latest note from UBS about On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) in which the investment firm said On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is doing really well. Cramer said he’s been saying On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is doing well for a “very long time” and said he is “sticking by” his bullish view on the stock.Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“In the third quarter, we purchased shares of On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON), a developer and distributor of athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories. On is one of the fastest-growing scaled athletic sports companies in the world. Management’s vision is to build a premium global sportswear brand based on innovation, design, and sustainability. Its products are sold through approximately 10,000 premium retail stores, which account for 65% of revenue. The balance of sales occur through its direct-to-consumer channel, encompassing its own branded and operated stores, as well as its website.On was founded in Switzerland, but it has expanded quickly across the globe. Its products have exhibited sales momentum in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The company is rapidly growing its base of roughly 10 flagship retail stores, and it plans to end this year with 47 stores across 18 cities in China. Roughly half of its revenue is generated in North America, 45% in Europe, and 5% in Asia Pacific. On is addressing a large market opportunity: the $355 billion global sportswear industry. This market has seen its growth driven by continued trends toward athleisure. Consumers continue to pivot their spending towards more comfortable and casual attire as they lead healthier, more active lifestyles.We believe On should be able to grow its revenues faster than 20% for many years, while also expanding its margins. We expect its growth to be driven by expanding brand awareness leading to market share gains in its core running shoe category, particularly as On expands its geographic footprint. We expect the company to continue to reinvest into its business at high rates of return. We believe On has a large opportunity to take market share in newer shoe categories, such as tennis (Roger Federer is an investor and advisor), training, and outdoor. The company also has a significant opportunity to grow its offerings in the apparel category.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 33Jim Cramer said in a latest program that Chewy Inc (NYSE:CHWY) is bottoming and that he is sticking to his bullish call made on the stock earlier.

2024-03-08T12:57:00.000Z,DexCom's (DXCM) Direct-to-Watch Feature to Boost Its G7 System,"DexCom Inc. DXCM recently introduced a new direct-to-Apple-Watch feature for its G7 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) users.With the new feature, G7 is likely to be the first CGM device that can link to Apple Watch directly, negating the requirement for an iPhone to be carried around. By the end of second-quarter 2024, Dexcom intends a gradual launch for all iOS users worldwide.For the past six months, DXCM’s shares have gained 17.3% compared with the industry’s rise of 9.5%. The S&P 500 increased 14.2% in the same time frame.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince the international conference of Advanced Technologies and Treatments of Diabetes 2023, Dexcom has expanded access to its ground-breaking real-time CGM technology by introducing its best-in-class G7 sensor into 16 new markets. Patients with diabetes of any kind, including gestational, who are two years of age and older can use Dexcom G7. This wearable glucose meter can be worn day or night on the back of the upper arm for up to 10 days, and it requires replacement.The Dexcom G7 CGM System is designed to be user-friendly, robust, and efficient. CGM uses a wearable sensor to continuously monitor your blood sugar levels. Without the inconvenience of fingersticks or scanning, Dexcom CGM Systems transmit your blood glucose readings in real time to a handheld receiver or smart device.Patients can control their glucose and accomplish outcomes like a lower A1C and more time in range by making better decisions about what to eat, how much to exercise, and how to take their medications when they have simpler access to real-time CGM data.The Dexcom G7 CGM sensor needs only 30 minutes to warm up, and there is a 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a seamless transition between sessions. The alert settings on the system have also been improved.The new direct-to-Apple-Watch feature for G7 will boost the sensor’s accessibility, driving better acceptance and reliability among its patient population. Moreover, it will allow to target a patient population using smartwatches, including Apple watches, for managing their health.Per a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital diabetes management market was estimated to be $18.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $35.8 billion by 2028 at a growth rate of 13.6%.The market is being driven by escalating diabetes care solutions and technological developments that have made it possible to introduce highly adaptable solutions. Other significant drivers include the increasing popularity of the use of connected devices and apps as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions.Given the market potential, the improvement and innovation of new features for its CGM system are likely to provide a significant boost to Dexcom’s business.Dexcom recently announced the FDA clearance of its Stelo glucose biosensor, which is available over-the-counter to consumers without a prescription. Stelo's approval for non-prescription use would further facilitate this population's access to cutting-edge CGM technology.In December 2023, Dexcom announced the Dexcom G7 CGM System connectivity with the t: slim X2 insulin pump by Tandem Diabetes Care in the United States, marking the first AID integration with the Dexcom G7 CGM.Dexcom also unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Athenry Co. Galway.

2024-03-08T12:19:07.000Z,Why another unexpectedly hot jobs report could derail markets,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Wall Street was taken aback by the US labor market’s resilience in January. Another unexpectedly hot report could shake things up again.The January jobs report showed that the US economy added a stunning 353,000 jobs that month and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%. That all but cemented investors’ belief that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates at its March policy meeting, and, coupled with hot inflation data, raised doubts about whether the Fed would cut rates at all this year.Those fears waned after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his congressional testimony this week that he’s not taking rate cuts off the table. Investors cheered Powell’s signal, helping push the S&P 500 index to close at a record high Thursday.“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle,” Powell said on Wednesday. “If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.”Still, the central bank hasn’t made it clear when it will begin paring back rates, keeping investors on edge ahead of key data releases. Economists expect that the US economy added 200,000 jobs last month, according to FactSet estimates. While far below January’s searing tally, that estimate would be a continuation of a historically strong labor market that’s stayed resilient against interest rates at a 23-year high.Traders largely expect the Fed will begin cutting rates in June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But those expectations could shift again depending on how the latest labor data looks, some investors say.“There’s no wiggle room for investors — even a slight upside surprise to job creation might rekindle fears about interest rates needing to be ‘higher for longer,’” wrote BeiChen Lin, investment strategist at Russell Investments, in a Monday note.It’s not just jobs data on Wall Street’s radar. The January Consumer Price Index is due next Tuesday, and investors will watch closely, especially after price hikes eased less than expected in January.“I would like to see inflation move down, a couple more data points, so we can be confident on that sustainable path to 2%,” Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Thursday on CNBC, adding that she believes more moderation in areas like employment growth could put the Fed in a position to cut rates later this year.Some economists are looking even further ahead to the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, slated for release at its March policy meeting. More specifically, investors are looking to the Fed’s dot plot, which charts the interest rate expectations over the next few years from each member of the Federal Open Market Committee.Central bank officials in December penciled in three quarter-point rate cuts for 2024 in their dot plot, which is released every other month.“Dots that point to one or two cuts rather than the three the market is anticipating may surprise folks, with incoming data likely to move the needle following hot January [labor] data,” wrote José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, in a note on Wednesday.Europeans using Apple, Google and other major tech platforms woke to a new reality Thursday as a landmark law imposed tough new competition rules on the companies — changing European Union citizens’ experience with phones, apps, browsers and more.The new EU regulations force sweeping changes on some of the world’s most widely used tech products, including Apple’s app store, Google search and messaging platforms, including Meta’s WhatsApp.And they mark a turning point in a global effort by regulators to bring tech giants to heel after years of allegations that the companies harmed competition and left consumers worse off, reports my colleague Brian Fung.The broad obligations apply only to the EU, which could leave tech users in the United States and other markets looking longingly at some of the features Big Tech is rolling out in response to the European directive.In one seismic shift to comply with the law, Apple said it plans to let EU users download iPhone apps via third-party app stores — easing its grip on iOS for the first time since the App Store’s debut 15 years ago.In another significant change, Google said it will alter search results to drive more traffic to independent comparison-shopping or travel-booking sites, instead of directing users toward Google Flights or other tools it owns.Google will also allow Android users to select a preferred browser and search engine from a menu of options when first setting up their devices, rather than defaulting users to Google’s Chrome browser and search engine. That could give a leg up to rival browsers such as Opera or Mozilla’s Firefox and competing search engines including DuckDuckGo or Microsoft’s Bing.Read more here.Customers of New York Community Bank (NYCB) pulled $6 billion worth of deposits between February 5 and March 5, leaving the bank’s deposit base 7% lower at $77 billion, according to my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald.However, the pattern is not indicative of a bank run, which these days can drain a lender of funds in mere hours. Shortly ahead of its demise, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank tried withdrawing $42 billion in one day over fears they wouldn’t be able to access their funds if the bank failed.NYCB provided the updated figures on an investor conference call Thursday morning after it announced it secured a $1 billion investment from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, among other private equity companies.Before the company disclosed in a filing last Thursday it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls, there weren’t significant changes in the bank’s level of deposits, said Alessandro DiNello, NYCB’s outgoing CEO, appointed just last week.“Friday was not a great day,” he said. “Over the weekend, Monday and Tuesday deposits were strong again.”Read more here.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/why-another-unexpectedly-hot-jobs-121907226.html

2024-03-08T11:00:00.000Z,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Adobe, Apple, Nvidia and Block","Chicago, IL – March 8, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Adobe ADBE, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Block Inc. SQ.Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.AdobeAdobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion.ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Adobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.AppleApple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.CEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.Block Inc.Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.Block remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average.The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

2024-03-08T10:21:00.000Z,Apple Has Spent $175 Billion on R&D Since the Start of 2013 -- but It's the $651 Billion Spent on Something Else That's the Real Jaw-Dropper,"Although it's been surpassed by Microsoft as the largest publicly traded company by market cap, few tech giants have delivered for investors quite like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).Despite its ebbs and flows, shares of Apple have scurried higher by 790% over the trailing-10-year period and have skyrocketed by almost 132,000% since its initial public offering in December 1980. Investors who simply purchased shares of Apple and did nothing else have historically done pretty well.While there's a laundry list of catalysts that have lifted Apple's valuation over time, the company's success ultimately boils down to two factors: innovation and a surprising ""investment"" that's been highly beneficial to its shareholders.To become one of the largest publicly traded companies, a business will generally have to grow at a sustained high rate and remain on the cutting edge of the innovation curve within its respective sector or industry. Peering back through more than 11 years of annual and quarterly filings, it's clear that Apple and its management team, led by CEO Tim Cook, aren't afraid to invest for the future.Research and development (R&D) expenses have grown every year since the start of 2013 and total just over $175 billion through the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (Dec. 30, 2023):2013: $4.475 billion in R&D expenses2014: $6.041 billion2015: $8.067 billion2016: $10.045 billion2017: $11.581 billion2018: $14.236 billion2019: $16.217 billion2020: $18.752 billion2021: $21.914 billion2022: $26.251 billion2023: $29.915 billionQ1 2024: $7.696 billionSome of these growing R&D expenses are undoubtedly directed at keeping the company in the lead in the smartphone arena. Since Apple integrated 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's seen its domestic market share in smartphones surge above 50%. Consumers tend to be exceptionally loyal to Apple's physical products, which include iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, among other accessories.However, Apple's R&D spending goes beyond the physical products that brought the company fame. For years, Tim Cook has been overseeing the evolution of Apple's operations. Although it's still producing and improving its popular physical products, Apple is aiming to be a platforms company that's ultimately driven by subscriptions.The advantage of the company's services focus is threefold:Subscriptions typically generate higher margins than physical products.It'll further enhance the loyalty of Apple's customer base by keeping consumers within its ecosystem of physical products and services.The steady revenue generated by Apple's Services segment will smooth out the sales fluctuations traditionally observed during iPhone upgrade cycles.What's even more eye-popping than the $175.19 billion Apple has spent on R&D since the beginning of 2013 is its ""investment"" that's nearly quadrupled R&D in size over the same period.With Apple generating boatloads of operating cash flow, it has the ability to take chances that most companies can't match. It can also reward shareholders in a way that no other business can.On a nominal-dollar basis, Apple's dividend is one of the largest in the world. Last year, the company doled out just a hair over $15 billion to its shareholders as a dividend. But its share repurchase program is many multiples larger.Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, Apple has overseen the repurchase of $650.88 billion worth of its common stock, which is tops among publicly traded companies:2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks2014: $45 billion2015: $35.253 billion2016: $29.722 billion2017: $32.9 billion2018: $72.738 billion2019: $66.897 billion2020: $72.358 billion2021: $85.971 billion2022: $89.402 billion2023: $77.55 billionQ1 2024: $20.139 billionThe beauty of share buybacks is twofold. To start with, a declining share count incrementally increases the ownership stakes of existing investors.But the second and arguably more important catalyst is that stock repurchases can increase a company's earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income will see their EPS grow over time as their outstanding share count declines. This can make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.As an example, Apple's net income declined from $99.8 billion in fiscal 2022 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September) to roughly $97 billion in fiscal 2023. But thanks to Apple spending $77.55 billion on buybacks last year, which retired more than 513 million shares, the company's adjusted EPS actually increased by $0.02 to $6.13 per share in 2023, despite the $2.8 billion drop in net income.Since the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased nearly 11 billion shares of common stock, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares.While buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's share price over the past 11 years and change, Wall Street and investors are likely eager to see one of the world's largest tech companies reignite its growth engine after it stalled out in 2023. But as long as Apple continues to aggressively put its money to work via buybacks, it's reasonable to expect modest EPS expansion.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-08T10:06:00.000Z,78% of Warren Buffett's $369 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 6 Stocks,"For nearly six decades, Warren Buffett has put on a master class in how to beat Wall Street. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a jaw-dropping aggregate return of 4,961,342%, as of the closing bell on March 1.Extensive books have been written discussing the investing philosophies that have allowed the Oracle of Omaha to trounce Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. These traits include buying stakes in brand-name businesses with strong management teams, as well as investing with a long-term mindset.But if there's one catalyst to Buffett's undeniable investing success that doesn't get nearly enough credit, it's his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both he and the recently departed Charlie Munger, who Buffett described as the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway"" in his annual letter to shareholders, have firmly believed that their top investment ideas deserve added weighting. If these top holdings perform well, it likely means Berkshire Hathaway stock can head even higher.Based on closing values from March 1, 78% -- $290 billion -- of the $369 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in only six stocks.Any question investors may have had about the Oracle of Omaha's desire to concentrate his company's portfolio is answered by looking at Berkshire's mammoth stake in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Even after Buffett and his team reduced their company's stake in Apple by roughly 1% during the December-ended quarter, it still accounts for 44% of invested assets.Apple's innovation has driven the outperformance of its stock for years. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's pretty consistently held a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.But this innovation extends well beyond its well-known physical products. For years, CEO Tim Cook has been overseeing a transformation that's emphasized subscription services. To be clear, Apple isn't forgetting about the physical products, like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, that brought it fame. Rather, it's evolving into a platforms company that'll further enhance customer loyalty and keep these customers within its ecosystem of products and services.The Oracle of Omaha is also, undeniably, a fan of Apple's world-leading capital-return program. Since introducing a share repurchase program in 2013, Apple has bought back more than $600 billion worth of its common stock.Another company that Warren Buffett and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, clearly love is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Berkshire owns more than 13% of the outstanding shares of BofA, which equates to almost $35.5 billion in market value.The lure of financial stocks for the Oracle of Omaha has always been the cyclical nature of the industry. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, economic downturns pass quickly. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, two periods of growth over the same span stuck around for at least a decade. Companies like Bank of America should be able to successfully grow their loan portfolios over time as the U.S. economy expands.Interestingly enough, Bank of America also holds an advantage in the current economic climate as the most interest-sensitive of all U.S. money-center banks. In other words, no bank will see its net-interest income shift more with changes to interest rates. The Fed's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to BofA's bottom line each quarter.To boot, BofA typically returns in excess of $20 billion to shareholders each year via dividends and buybacks when the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders.Even though a tech stock accounts for the leading stake in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, there's not a sector Buffett enjoys putting his company's cash to work in more than financials. It's why American Express (NYSE: AXP) is the second financial stock in Berkshire's top-three holdings.The not-so-subtle secret to AmEx's continued success is its willingness to play on both sides of the transaction aisle. In the U.S., which is the top market for consumption globally, it's the clear No. 3 in credit card network purchase volume.But in addition to facilitating transactions and collecting a fee from merchants, American Express is also acting as a lender to consumers and businesses in which it earns annual fees and interest income. During extended periods of economic growth, AmEx's ability to double-dip allows it to thrive.The other factor that makes American Express a top-notch investment is its success in luring well-to-do consumers. People with higher incomes are less likely than the average earner to alter their spending habits during minor periods of economic disruption. On paper, this should help AmEx navigate challenging economic climates better than most lending institutions.The fourth-largest holding is the longest-tenured stock in Buffett's portfolio, beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Shares of Coca-Cola have been held since 1988.What's more, Berkshire Hathaway is netting a roughly 60% annual yield on its Coke shares thanks to a minuscule cost basis of $3.2475 per share. Coca-Cola recently increased its base annual payout for a 62nd consecutive year.A big reason the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team view Coca-Cola as a core holding is its consistency. According to Kantar's annual Brand Footprint report, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand from retail shelves for 10 years running (as of 2022). Since it's selling consumer staples that'll be purchased in any economic climate, Coca-Cola's cash flow and profits tend to be highly predictable.Coca-Cola also enjoys virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has existing operations in every other country. This allows it to generate that aforementioned predictable cash flow in developed markets, while moving the organic growth needle via emerging markets.Throughout much of this century, energy stocks have played little or no role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Over the past two years and change, we've witnessed a sizable shift in sentiment from Berkshire's brightest minds. Integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) currently holds the No. 5 spot in the $369 billion portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees.Having more than $19 billion invested in a leading oil and gas stock is a pretty clear indication that Buffett and his team believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms. Supporting this thesis is multiple years of capital underinvestment by major energy companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This underinvestment has led to energy commodity supply constraints that should provide a healthy lift to the spot price of crude oil and push profits for drillers higher.The ""integrated"" aspect of Chevron's operating model is also important. Although drilling generates its juiciest margins, Chevron owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. If the spot price of crude oil declines, the company's midstream and downstream assets act as a hedge that stabilizes its cash flow.The icing on the cake here is that Chevron doles out a 4% yield and has raised its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.Warren Buffett's $369 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway only has two energy stocks, but they occupy the fifth and sixth spots in terms of portfolio concentration. The 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) held by Berkshire, worth $15.2 billion on March 1, have all been added since the start of 2022.While the macro catalysts described with Chevron align similarly with integrated oil and gas operator Occidental, there are some very defined differences between these two companies.For example, Occidental brings in the lion's share of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment. This means its operating cash flow is highly sensitive to shifts in the spot price of crude oil. While it'll benefit more than other integrated operators (including Chevron) if oil prices increase, the reciprocal is also true -- Occidental will struggle mightily if the spot price for crude oil significantly declines.The other big difference between Chevron and Occidental can be seen on their balance sheets. Whereas Chevron has what's arguably the best balance sheet among oil majors with a low debt-to-equity ratio, Occidental is still lugging around $18.5 billion in net debt. Unlike Chevron, Occidental needs the spot price of crude oil to remain high to continue reducing its outstanding debt.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-08T09:12:34.000Z,BofA Says Tech Stocks Post Largest Weekly Outflows on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The largest weekly outflow on record for technology stock funds hasn’t dimmed the broader euphoria that is driving US equities to “ferocious” gains, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.Most Read from BloombergHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear SuppliersChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilNasdaq 100 Falls 1.5% as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets WrapChina Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US CurbsTSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip PlantAbout $4.4 billion was pulled from tech funds in the week through March 6, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. The outflows come as Apple Inc. shares entered a technical correction this month, amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.Hartnett — who has taken a more neutral tone on stocks this year after remaining bearish in 2023 — said equity markets are showing “abnormal gains” in “abnormal times” after a 25% rally in the S&P 500 since end-October. That’s left positioning “stretched and extended” ahead of expectations for an eventual interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, he wrote in a note.US stocks have scaled record highs this year, driven by the frenzy around artificial intelligence and optimism about a pivot in the Fed’s monetary policy. A narrow group of tech behemoths — the so-called Magnificent Seven — have driven a majority of the gains, but there’s been a growing dispersion between the stocks in the past few weeks.While Nvidia Corp. has scaled record highs, Apple and Tesla Inc. have slumped 12% and 28%, respectively, this year.Still, Hartnett reiterated that technology stocks could have more room to rally, even though semiconductors are trading at their highest level on record relative to the S&P 500.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists also don’t see a concentration risk in US stocks, as they say the top stocks trade at much lower valuations than the largest stocks did at the peak of the tech bubble.“While investors usually think of elevated concentration as a sign of downside risk, the S&P 500 rallied more often than it declined” in the 12 months after past episodes of peak concentration, Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider wrote in a note.For BofA’s Hartnett, the only factor that could “melt this determination” in markets is a drop in US payrolls. Latest data, due Friday, are expected to show the US economy added 200,000 new jobs last month.Other highlights from the note, citing EPFR Global data:Global stock funds had inflows of $6.9 billion in the week through March 6, while $17.3 billion was added to bond fundsUS stock funds registered outflows of $100 millionEuropean funds suffered a tenth straight week of redemptions at $1.2 billion--With assistance from Michael Msika.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/bofa-says-tech-stocks-post-091234284.html

2024-03-08T01:00:31.000Z,TikTok Divestment Push Advances With House Committee Approval,"(Bloomberg) -- A top Republican lawmaker said he’d seek a House vote next week on a bill that would force TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell the app or face a ban in the US, injecting new momentum into a congressional push to curtail Beijing’s influence over the video-sharing service.Most Read from BloombergStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets WrapEx-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic PrimaryChina Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US WheatUnited Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10sTrump Wins Republican Nomination, Setting Up Rematch With BidenThe legislation, which was advanced by a key committee on Thursday, would block internet service providers and app stores such as those run by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google from offering the platform unless TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. sells it within six months.After the Energy and Commerce Committee voted to approve the bill by a vote of 50-0, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the number two Republican in the House said he would bring it up for a vote on the House floor. Scalise said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the measure would force TikTok to “sever their ties with the Chinese Communist Party.”Previous legislative attempts to restrict the app nationwide have failed, and this one would still have to clear legislative obstacles in the House and Senate, where it doesn’t have a sponsor. But lawmakers say this latest effort has been months in the making, fueled partly by renewed security concerns that China is surveilling Americans.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he was “talking with my chairs and caucus about the legislation. I will listen to their views on the bill and determine the best path.”TikTok mounted a last-minute effort to counter the bill, which was unveiled Tuesday, by urging its users to call congressional offices to protest the bill via a message that greeted them when they opened the app. Congressional offices were flooded with calls, drawing the ire of House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher.Lawmakers said “their phones were ringing off the hook last night,” Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican, told journalists outside the Capitol on Thursday. “The intimidation tactics, the disinformation has to stop,” he said later in a video message.In the end the campaign was unsuccessful, at least in preventing lawmakers from taking the first step toward enacting the legislation.Read More: TikTok Can Keep ‘Bad Lip-Sync,’ Lawmakers Seeking Sale SayBoth Democrats and Republicans have long expressed national security concerns over TikTok’s ties to ByteDance, citing risks of the Chinese government collecting personal data from Americans and spreading propaganda on the app. The platform has been under a national security review since the Trump administration. The Biden administration has signaled cautious support for the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying Wednesday that “we would want to see this bill get done.”TikTok has consistently denied that it has or will share any US user data with Beijing and has tried to assuage US concerns by spending more than $1.5 billion to isolate its US operations and agreeing to oversight from American partner Oracle Corp. TikTok said in a statement that the legislation would trample First Amendment free speech rights and deprive millions of small businesses of a platform on which they rely.The app is already emerging as an important place for conversations in a presidential election year. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has even created an account on the app ahead of November’s vote. More than 170 million Americans scroll the app every month, making its users an important asset.After the vote, TikTok said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the new bill “has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.”Divesting TikTok from its Chinese parent would be a complicated, though perhaps not impossible, maneuver. ByteDance developed the technology at the foundation of the viral video service and its engineers also support a twin service for the China market called Douyin.Earlier: TikTok Threat to Amazon Emerges With $20 Billion Shopping PilotIf forced to proceed by US lawmakers, ByteDance might try to separate the US business of TikTok while retaining the business in the rest of the world. TikTok’s US business could be valued at $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year.Any outright sale however faces strong opposition from Beijing, which could try and block such a deal. The Chinese government has been sensitive to leakages of data abroad, particularly when they involve giant internet firms such as ByteDance.In 2020, under pressure from the Trump administration, ByteDance went through extensive negotiations to separate the American operations and turn them over to either Oracle or Microsoft Corp. While the Chinese company picked Oracle, the deal was ultimately called off as the Biden administration took over and opted not to impose a ban.(Updates with Schumer statement, in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the PollsHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tiktok-divestment-push-advances-house-203742044.html

But just because Apple unveiled its bad news in this market, it's been punished very heavily. Whereas Meta has been able to regain ground by gaining in other places, such as AI. Similarly, if you look at what's happened to Apple in China, a real fall in iPhone sales in China.I think we're going to see some of that China weakness materialize when it comes to semiconductors. I think it's going to hit NVIDIA, it's going to hit some of the others. I think Apple's become a microcosm. And I think what we're going to see is the rest of this group at risk.JOSH LIPTON: And talk about some picks, Ann, that I know you like. One is CRM, Salesforce. Why do you see opportunity there, Ann?ANN BERRY: Well, I think with something like Salesforce, they've gone through this cycle, Josh, that Apple's going through at the moment, which is they're flushing their bad news. They've made some really difficult decisions around cost reduction. They've been making some very aggressive moves on pricing. They are doing short-term initiatives to try to gain market share down the line, that's going to hurt them in the near term but help them gain share in the long termAnd so I'm seeing Salesforce take bold moves, self-medicating, to try and get through this tough period of adjustment. But at least they're doing it. So I want to go into these names before we see all the results come full throttle.JOSH LIPTON: And I want to get you on here on this, Ann. Another interesting pick for you, you've got a cybersecurity pick. We were talking-- which is such an interesting space right now because we were talking to Rob Owens from Piper, and Rob's been covering the space for a few decades at this point. He said, listen, it's as healthy as he has ever seen it. But we were talking about how different names kind of reacting differently. You saw CrowdStrike, they reported, they're clearly capitalizing. Palo Alto Networks reported and very much disappointed, but that's a name you like, Ann. How come?ANN BERRY: Well, Palo Alto Networks is one when I invest on the private side, specifically, Josh. In the cybersecurity sector. I, for example, invested in a deepfake detection company. The name that keeps coming back to me over and over and over again by those who are innovating and operating in cyber is Palo Alto Networks, as best in class.And yes, they came out with a less than rosy outlook for the year. I would call it a realistic outlook for the year. One they can truly execute upon and deliver against expectations. And their share price got absolutely hammered for it. So I think that's a quality business, again, where we've seen this over punishment simply for delivering realistic news. Cyber is not going anywhere. Cybersecurity is absolutely here to stay. It is going to be a huge end market, by the way, for semiconductors and for upgraded chip requirements. So I want to go in on the best in class player, and that's Palo Alto.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/mag-7-experiencing-outsized-punishment-222434117.html
2024-03-07T22:13:32.000Z,15 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024,"In this article, we will list the 15 best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. If you want to sip our discussion about Apple's patent infringement, smartwatch market, and smartwatch ownership globally, go to the 7 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.A patent infringement case is pushing Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) to stop selling two of the most recent Apple Watch models, Series 9 and Ultra 2. The disputed component in these watches is the blood oxygen technology. The International Trade Center (ITC) ruled on October 2023 that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has infringed patents for pulse oximetry tech by Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a medical device manufacturer. The tech giant is trying to come up with a solution, but it seems like it will be a while before that happens. Given this ban, it is worth looking at some of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. The global smartwatch market is growing at a fast rate. It was valued at $33.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $90.4 billion by 2032, growing at a compounding annual growth rate of 10.5% during this period. The convenience of glancing at the wrist to stay informed about messages, calls, and important updates without picking up the phone is one of the biggest reasons for its market growth. Another pivotal factor propelling the smartwatch market is health and fitness. These watches provide a holistic approach to health management. They offer features such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout guidance. However, smartwatches do not come cheap, and their cost is one of the greatest hindrances in the growth of the global market.  There are many ways to segment the global smartwatch market, but one of the most common segregation is based on screen type. Currently, these watches are segmented into LCD and OLED according to the screen type, with OLED having a 91% share of the market.OLED has many advantages, which is why it is contributing to the overall growth of the market. Compared to LCD, it offers more vibrant colors and is more energy efficient.Another way to segment smartwatches is based on the application. These segments include running, notification checking, swimming, and cycling. The running segment takes the lion's share of 36%. Brand-wise, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is the largest player in the market with a 20% market share. Other major players include Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) and Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN).  Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) was founded in 1984 and went public in 1990. The company has been at the forefront of smartwatch technology, recently launching exclusive smartwatch capabilities like next-gen touchscreen technology and advancements in hybrid smartwatches. However, it is worth noting that Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) recently announced quitting the smartwatches market. Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) is a prominent company known for its innovative products and solutions. The company is known for its continuous innovation in the smartwatch industry. Some of the most popular smartwatches by Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) include the Gramin Venu 2, which ranks quite high on our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024. Currently, more than 200 million people use smartwatch globally. Like smartphone ownership in the US, men have a slight advantage as 23% of them use a smartwatch compared to 21.8% of women. It is worth noting here that ownership is the highest among internet users aged 25 to 34. Interestingly, within this age group, women are more likely to own a smartwatch. Of all internet-using people aged 25 to 34, 27.2% of women use a smartwatch as opposed to 26.9% of men. With that backdrop, let's look at the 15 best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024. A marathon runner wearing a company branded smartwatch, monitoring his performance in real-time.To curate our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024, we consulted 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the watch appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of watches in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 15/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the watch ranks on our list. The ranking factor is designed in a way that it is always positive but less than 1. So, if the Insider Monkey score of watch A is 3.75, 3 is its frequency, whereas 0.75 is its ranking factor. For comparison, if watch B had an Insider Monkey Score of 4.40, its frequency is 4, but overall it ranked lower than watch A on our sources. However, since we prioritize frequency, watch B ranks higher on our list. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.Amazfit T Rex 2 is one of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.

2024-03-07T20:28:00.000Z,Do These 2 Stocks Belong in the Magnificent 7?,"The so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ group, consisting of Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, and Amazon AMZN, has been a dominant story within the market for some time, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains.They’ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.However, two of the members in particular, Apple AAPL and Tesla TSLA, have come under scrutiny amid considerable underperformance relative to the rest of the group. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven their underperformance, should they be kicked out of the elite club? Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.Apple Apple hasn’t seen any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, with analysts lowering their expectations across multiple timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcerning headline figures in its latest release, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS totaled $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. In addition, Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and jumped 11.3% from the same period last year.Apple’s Services portfolio has been an excellent source of growth, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone. Nonetheless, shares fell following the report, attributed to demand worries in China. Sales in the region reached $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.Slowing growth has undoubtedly been reflected by the recent share performance, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 7% earnings growth on a marginal 0.6% sales increase. Still, shares are currently trading at their most oversold levels in years, undoubtedly worth keeping an eye on.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the company’s remarkable cash-generating abilities, established customer base, and news surrounding AI, the company’s long-term view remains bright. If positive earnings estimate revisions begin creeping in, shares will likely follow and move higher. TeslaOnce hailed as the poster child for growth stocks, Tesla’s share performance over the last year has left many investors with a sour taste. Lower margins, hybrid momentum, and competition in China have all been thorns in the side of the company.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe weak share performance has coincided with bearishness among analysts, with the company’s earnings outlook moving lower across all timeframes. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, the company continues to be the dominant EV player, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle in the world throughout 2023. And operations remain sound – Tesla posted $4.4 billion of free cash flow throughout its FY23 and saw its cost of goods sold per vehicle decline sequentially throughout its Q4.The company’s growth is forecasted to stall slightly in its current year (FY24), with consensus estimates alluding to 1.3% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. Growth resumes in a big way for FY25, as expectations presently suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 20% higher revenues.The stock remains a prime consideration for those bullish on the long-term EV picture, but analysts’ recent revisions reflect a cloudy near-term outlook.Bottom Line The ‘Magnificent 7’ has been on the minds of all investors, whose performance as a group has been remarkable.Still, two members of the club – Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL – are beginning to be shunned by the market, with the share performance of each over the last year lagging considerably.Both Tesla and Apple remain great long-term stocks, underpinned by fundamentals and operational execution. But recent performance has been anything but magnificent, especially when compared to the other members.It’s worth noting that many of the other Mag 7 members, including Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT, currently boast a much stronger earnings outlook. All four of these members presently sport a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), reflecting upward-trending earnings estimate revisions.The remaining member, Alphabet GOOGL, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen positive revisions across multiple timeframes as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-07T19:37:48.000Z,EU looking into Apple's decision to kill Epic Games' developer account,"The European Union has confirmed it's looking into Apple's decision to close Epic Games' developer account -- citing three separate regulations that may apply.Yesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month.Epic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as Fortnight on Apple's platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account.Responding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has ""requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.""The pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels' time today.The spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise compliance ""doubts"" with regard to two other regulations -- the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the platform-to-business regulation (P2B) -- given what they described as ""the links between the developer program membership and the App Store as designated VLOP"" (very large online platform).Rules the EU's DMA applies to Apple, as a designated ""gatekeeper"" and its App Store, as a so-called core platform service, require the company to permit third-party app stores. Failure to comply with the DMA risks major penalties -- of up to 10% of global annual turnover (or 20% for repeat offenders).While a subset of rules in the DSA, which also apply to Apple's App Store as a designated VLOP, have been in force for larger platforms since August 2023 -- with the rest of the regulation's provisions applying on platforms and many more digital services since last month. Penalties for breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover.The EU's P2B regulation, meanwhile, contains measures intended to boost platform transparency and curb unfair practices. It has been in force for longer (since 2020).Under the P2B law, sudden and unexpected account suspensions are banned, with platforms having to provide clear reasons for terminations. However, unlike the DMA and the DSA's regime for VLOPs, P2B enforcement is not the responsibility of the Commission. It's devolved to member state level authorities, which also determine any possible penalties for breaches. Although it's possible Commission enforcers may factor in whether platforms play nice with P2B rules as part of their assessment of VLOPs' DSA compliance, given there is some overlap in scope.Epic has claimed Apple terminated its developer account in retaliation for its criticism of the iPhone maker's DMA proposal, which requires developers to sign up to new T&Cs that include a new ""core technology"" in order to tap into DMA entitlements.Yesterday, Apple issued an aggressive statement in response -- hitting back at Epic's accusations and citing a U.S. court ruling as justification for terminating its account. It also claimed no executive had reviewed Epic's application to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, suggesting it was done via a click-through agreement.""Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,"" Apple wrote yesterday, citing a September 2021 U.S. court ruling pertaining to Epic’s litigation against Apple. The game maker sued Apple in the U.S., alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use its own payment systems.In September 2021, the U.S. court ruled Apple does not hold a monopoly in digital mobile gaming transactions. Although it did order it not to prohibit developers from adding links to their apps to direct users to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the purchase of digital goods.At the time, Apple trumpeted the judgment as a win -- saying the court had found the App Store does not violate antitrust law. The U.S. court also did not require Apple to allow third-party app stores or sideloading. However, under the EU's DMA, Apple is required to permit third-party app stores and third-party software downloads and must not block business users from offering wares through their own channels.The U.S. court ruling Apple is citing to justify terminating Epic's developer account is unlikely to have standing in the EU. However, Apple may be seeking to play one legal jurisdiction off against another -- which has decided its market power is a problem and already passed laws regulating how it can operate its App Store.Apple was contacted for a response to the Commission's request for further explanations of its actions under the DMA and to the doubts the bloc is raising about its compliance with other measures applied to the App Store by the DSA and P2B. It said it has nothing further to add to the remarks it made yesterday -- which argue the U.S. court ruling affirms its contractual right to terminate Epic's account.In those remarks, Apple noted the termination of Epic's account is not limited to the EU. It said its Developer Program License Agreements (DPLA) are global agreements; claimed Epic's breach of the DPLA agreement (via its ""hotfix"" patch, which sought to circumvent Apple's rules by covertly deploying code that let users purchase in-game currency) was also implemented around the world, including in Europe; and suggested the court injunction allowing termination is globally applicable.The company also noted Epic continues to litigate against it in the U.S. and Australia.Update: The EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has also now weighed in on the spat -- writing on X: ""Under the DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority."" He urged developers to get in touch with their feedback on gatekeepers' compliance.🚨Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers.I have asked our services to look into Apple’s termination of Epic’s developer account as a matter of priority.To all developers in 🇪🇺 & 🌍: now is the time to have your say on gatekeepers’…— Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) March 7, 2024Europe’s DMA rules for Big Tech explainedApple terminates Epic Games developer account calling it a ‘threat’ to the iOS ecosystemThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-epic-dev-account-dma/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/eu-looking-apples-decision-kill-102512197.html
2024-03-07T19:26:30.000Z,Europe's DMA rules for Big Tech explained,"The Digital Markets Act (DMA), an ex ante European Union reform of digital competition rules, will be in force today, by midnight Brussels' time, on six tech giants -- applying a new set of legal requirements on more than 20 of their ""core platform services"" (CPS).Online empires that scaled in an era of minimal interventions from regulators, shaping the commercial web as we know it, are now facing a prescriptive set of rules on how they can operate and do business in the EU, including hard limits on their use of data; interoperability mandates; and bans on self-preferencing.The six companies designated under the DMA so far -- as so-called Internet ""gatekeepers"" -- are: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft.Read on for an overview of the new law, its early impacts on platforms and Big Tech, and how it might change digital business as we know it, starting in Europe...The aim of the pan-EU regulation is -- essentially -- to crack open Big Tech's market power. The DMA shoots to make digital markets fairer and more contestable by applying a set of up-front obligations and restrictions on the kingpin players entrenched atop digital markets. Such as -- for example -- a ban on Google's self-preferencing in search results; or on Amazon using rivals' data to feed its own retail product development; or on Meta processing user data for ad targeting without people's consent; or a ban on Apple banning third party app stores from its mobile platform, iOS.Data portability and interoperability are key planks of the regime -- which also, for example, requires Meta to open up its WhatsApp and Messenger platforms to rival services to allow cross-platform access. Idea being smaller messaging apps can offer their users the ability to reach people using those dominant messaging networks without having to sign up for an account with their gatekeeper.EU lawmakers generally want the DMA to foster service switching and ""multihoming"" to reduce Big Tech's grip on web users' eyeballs and wallets, unlocking the chance for competitors to get a look in. Put another way, the phenomenon of online services evolving into self-reinforcing ecosystems and empires, through network effects and gatekeeper lock-in tactics, is the centrifugal force the DMA is attacking with a range of pro-competition countermeasures targeted at strategic gateways, like app stores, operating systems and web browsers.Whether the regulation will actually succeed in loosening dominant platform operators' grip on digital markets is uncertain. But the EU is going to try.The main DMA criteria for a platform being deemed an ""important gateway"" for business users to reach end users, and whose entrenched owner/operator has a ""significant impact"" on the EU's internal market, is annual revenue of at least €7.5 billion in each of the last three financial years or a market cap of at least €75 billion in the last financial year. A gatekeeper must also provide the same CPS in at least three EU Member States; and these platforms must have at least 45 million monthly active users regionally and at least 10,000 business users.The bloc has given itself some wiggle room to designate ""emerging"" gatekeepers, too -- if the Commission believes a platform will gain an entrenched and durable market position in the near future it can also impose some rules, with the aim of preventing that outcome.The DMA's sizeable ambition is backed up with serious teeth, too: The regulation allows for penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover for breaches -- or even 20% for repeat offences. So we're talking fines that could run to tens of billions of dollars apiece.Oversight and enforcement responsibility is centralized with the European Commission. This is an attempt to streamline enforcement and avoid the patchy outcomes we've seen with other EU digital regulations, thanks to variable resourcing and forum shopping. However this approach piles complex and high stakes work on the EU's executive -- so one question is whether the bloc might have bitten off more than it can chew?The DMA does allow for private enforcement, too, in the form of litigation targeting non-compliance -- so gatekeepers could face being sued in European courts over unfair practices if they fail to get with the program.Currently, the six gatekeepers' regulated CPS span a number of techno playing fields -- namely: Social networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn); “intermediation” services (Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Amazon Marketplace, iOS App Store, Meta Marketplace); ads delivery systems (Google, Amazon and Meta); browsers (Chrome, Safari); operating systems (Google Android, iOS, Windows PC OS); N-IICS or Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger); search engines (Google); and video sharing platforms (YouTube).The regulation allows for CPS to be designated in other tech arenas too, such as cloud computing services and virtual assistants. But so far none have been named in those domains -- and cloud computing is one notable early gap (especially given the role hyperscalers like Microsoft are playing in the fast developing generative AI market).Asked about the cloud computing designation gap, the Commission told us the DMA is built on a system of self-assessment which requires platforms to notify it when they consider they meet the regulation's thresholds -- which no cloud operator has so far done.""At this stage we do not have elements to question this self-assessment,"" the Commission spokesperson said, adding they will ""continue to monitor market developments"" in cloud -- and also emphasizing the current tally of six gatekeepers (and 22 CPS) is ""only the start, not the end"". More gatekeepers and/or CPS may well be added to the list soon. Reports earlier this month said social media firm X, TikTok's parent ByteDance's ads business and European online travel agency Booking.com have notified the Commission of reaching the regulation's usage thresholds -- suggesting they could progress to being designated in the coming months. (The Commission told us it has 45 working days to take a decision on this trio of potential designations.)It's worth noting a number of gatekeepers are also challenging their designations in the bloc's courts. (Three so far: Apple, Meta and TikTok.) So it's at least possible some platforms could convince judges they don't qualify as entrenched gatekeepers and be struck off the list. (ByteDance, for instance, is arguing it should be seen as a Big Tech challenger, given its relative newness on the scene vs longer in the tooth tech giants. But it remains to be seen what EU courts will make of the argument.)Some tech giants have also deployed counterarguments that have been successful at avoiding designations. For example, the Commission recently decided against adding Apple's iMessage, Microsoft Advertising, its search engine Bing and web browser Edge to the list -- after accepting arguments their respective services are not popular enough to qualify.Last year the Commission also decided against designating Samsung's internet browser, despite the company notifying the EU it hit DMA usage thresholds -- with the bloc assessing it did not hold the necessary gateway position in the browser category. The EU also chose not to designate webmail providers, Gmail and Outlook, at that time, accepting counterarguments against their intermediating market power too.The bloc's intention has always been for the DMA to be tightly focused -- on only the most powerful gatekeeping giants. However one early (political) charge levelled at the EU's approach is it puts restrictions and obligations on (only) foreign (and mostly U.S.) tech giants.This attack tactic is one that seems particularly weak and unlikely to trouble Brussels. If digital market power is concentrated offshore then a regulation that aims to rebalance tipped digital markets must, necessarily, shoot at offshore targets. And it's fair to say U.S. lawmakers have themselves raised plenty of concerns about homegrown platforms' market power in recent years.In any case, European platforms that build enough momentum to fall into scope face becoming regulated, too -- as Booking.com may soon be.In recent weeks we've seen a range of moves by gatekeepers in claimed preparation for compliance with the DMA. Apple's new ""core tech fee"" on iOS and opening up to non-WebKit-based browsers in the EU, for instance, or Google tweaking how it displays some search results and quietly switching off default cross-service tracking of its own users.Meta has also given a glimpse of work to roll out messaging interoperability to WhatsApp and Messenger. That particular strand of the regulation will take time to bear fruit as in-scope messaging platforms get three months to respond to interoperability requests. So how effective and user-friendly these implementations will be remains to be seen.The regulation also allows for a phased rollout of messaging interoperability, with only basic functionalities (texting, image/video and file sharing and asynchronous voice messages between two individual users) required initially. Group messaging interoperability isn't required until two years after a gatekeeper designation; while a full four years has been allowed for platforms to put in place interoperability for video and voice calling, between individual users and groups.At the same time, Meta looks to be attempting a direct swerve of other DMA requirements, aimed at reforming privacy-hostile business models, by concocting a version of consent that requires users to pay literal money if they want to avoid being tracked and profiled.So, in short, the early picture is mixed, with so many pieces in flux and uncertainty over how exactly the law will be enforced. It'll likely take time before we see how much market transformation the DMA is actually driving.While some early moves by tech giants look significant and could create interesting new opportunities for competition and innovation, others are obviously cynical and self-serving -- showing entrenched platform giants doing their level best to avoid having to end exploitative practices and/or reform entire business models.Days out from the DMA compliance deadline we're also seeing some editing of compliance proposals in response to early criticism. Such as Apple removing certain requirements it had said it would impose on developers wanting to take up entitlements, after they complained it was making it too arduous for them to tap into the new opportunities.Bear in mind, whatever gatekeepers' blog posts and briefings claim on DMA compliance, it'll be up to Commission to assess whether or not they're meeting the legal bar. So we're not going to get a clear picture of how digital markets will actually change until we start to see how and where the EU will take enforcement action to rein in gatekeeper flexes and tackle competitive pinch-points.This also means there's likely to be ongoing PR war, involving both the gatekeepers themselves and their fiercest critics, as each side seeks to shape the narrative about what's real or fake compliance. (See, for instance, Spotify's immediate decrying of Apple's reworked iOS fee structure and Apple's aggressive pushback by putting a spotlight on the scale of Spotify's app business success. Or Epic Games claiming yesterday that Apple terminated its iOS developer account after it criticized its DMA proposal as ""malicious compliance"". So get the popcorn in.)The Commission is actively calling for stakeholders to send feedback on DMA compliance moves to support its assessment of gatekeepers. Effective oversight will clearly require an industry-wide effort. To this end, it's organized a series of workshops in Brussels later this month when it wants tech giants to sit around a table and discuss compliance, face to face, with business users.How -- or even whether -- gatekeepers engage in good faith with this EU process will be fascinating to watch. Although they must make their compliance reports public. But if platforms refuse to turn up in person to defend their compliance approaches they'll be leaving their loudest critics to bend EU enforcers' ears unchallenged. This means gatekeepers are facing a bit of a Hobson's choice that, for once, is not of their own dark pattern design.The workshop set-up looks cleverly conceived by the Commission as a tactic to compel gatekeepers into dialogue (and potentially concessions) about compliance shortcomings. Whoever best engages with the EU may have the strongest chance of cementing compliance narratives that sway DMA enforcers.At the same time, tech giants remain exceptionally well resourced, employing armies of lawyers who will have been tasked with poring over the detail of the DMA to find weak spots and loopholes they can exploit to minimize damage to commercial self-interest. Legal challenges to enforcement decisions look highly likely. Which means the Commission will have to divert resources into defensive action, too, and there's a risk of the regime getting bogged down in litigation as time goes on.Judging by early compliance proposals, some gatekeepers appear to have calculated they'd rather take their chances in the courts -- and risk hefty DMA non-compliance fines -- than willingly dismantle lucrative business-as-usual on Day 1 of this New Online World Order. So far, for example, both Apple and Google have indicated they plan to keep charging fees even if app developers selling digital goods on their mobile platforms make use of DMA-enabled opportunities to point their users to cheaper offers outside the gatekeepers' stores to complete transactions. Bottom line: Rent demands won't stop tomorrow. So expect the likes of Spotify and Epic Games to keep crying foul.Since the DMA does not ban gatekeepers from charging fees for their services, nor stipulate a set formula for rates -- beyond requirements to have T&Cs that are FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) -- platform giants may feel confident they have a strong case that the fees they charge are fair and reasonable given how much technology and market access their platforms provide.However, in recent days, the Commission has signalled it may be preparing to take action over complaints about unfair fees. Speaking earlier this week, as she hit Apple with an almost $2 billion fine over anti-steering on the music streaming market, the EU's competition chief and EVP for digital matters, Margrethe Vestager, said “novel fee structures” should not be used as a tactic to undermine incentives for developers to do something else.In another example of early DMA friction, look to Meta's bid to force consent from EU users via imposing a 'pay or be tracked' choice on users of Facebook and Instagram, both now designated CPS. The adtech giant's apparent refusal to reform its business model, even with the DMA coming into view, follows years of complaints over its unlawful processing of user data under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Two other legal bases Meta had claimed for the ads processing were overturned last year -- forcing a switch to consent. But instead of giving users a free choice to deny tracking, Meta concocted a controversial ad-free subscription choice that puts Facebook and Instagram users in a privacy bind.It will therefore be very interesting to see what the Commission does about this -- now DMA gatekeeper's -- attempt to redefine EU law around consent to fit its commercial self interest. ""Gatekeepers should not design, organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of end users to freely give consent,"" runs the regulation's recitals vis-a-vis ""personalized advertising"". The law also stipulates: ""Not giving consent should not be more difficult than giving consent.""Earlier this month, the bloc sent Meta a request for information about its ad-free subscription under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act (DSA) -- which also puts limits on the use of people's data for ads (and came into force on Meta's business last August). So the EU is already scrutinizing Meta's consent model. How they act on such an obvious privacy abuse with the DMA also in force will be one to watch.Elsewhere, gatekeepers appear to be accepting some of the operational writing on the wall. In recent days, for example, a number of the tech giants have been announcing data portability APIs. We've also had notice of incoming choice screens -- from Apple and Google -- which EU lawmakers hope will open up competition in web browser and search markets.While the devil will be in the detail of how these screens are designed, and when and where they pop up, some early responses are sounding positive.Eco search engine, Ecosia, has described Google as a ""collaborative partner"" during the design process for the incoming search choice screen, for example. ""There is now a unique opportunity for alternative search engines such as Ecosia -- with less than 0.1% of the global market share (compared to Google’s 92%) -- to take full advantage of these improved market conditions and openness,"" Sophie Dembinski, its head of public policy and climate action, noted in a statement this week.On the flip side, privacy search engine and browser, DuckDuckGo, got in touch to tell us it's radically unimpressed by Google's initial offer.""By deciding to only show a choice screen when people are setting up an Android device for the first time, Google is artificially limiting how many people are even exposed to a choice screen -- for Android, that is a 3% to 5% of the total user base per quarter, bringing in frustratingly slow change to the market,"" it wrote in a briefing note circulated to press this week. ""The process is broken. Gatekeepers shouldn’t be in a position to propose solutions to problems they created. Third party experts should be involved in the compliance process from the get-go, with rapid iterations on implementation to reach mutually agreed KPIs.""DuckDuckGo argues the DMA demands far more meaningful reform on default choices -- saying Google must make it persistently easy for consumers to switch default choices, rather than just popping up occasional choice screens. So this is another fight where the Commission will have to not so much pick a side as choose where the compliance line lies.Also on the negative side, mobile developers are decrying what they dub Apple's ""scare screens"" -- aka, notifications the iOS maker intends to pop up to warn users of the risks of transacting outside its App Store. But the DMA does allow gatekeepers to take ""necessary and proportionate"" measures to safeguard user security. So the Commission may even be dragged into refereeing the substance and tone of these sort of user-facing comms.How the Commission handles its new role as gatekeeper enforcer remains to be seen. But one wider effect the DMA looks to be having is inspiring lawmakers elsewhere to pass similar laws so users in other countries can tap into opportunities that can be seen unfolding in the EU as the bloc has a go at taming Big Tech.The so-called ""Brussels' effect"" leading to DMA copycats is already being discussed. ""We're seeing copycats around the world already,"" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Washington-based thinktank the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), which counts a number of gatekeepers among its members, speaking during a press briefing this week. ""We're seeing copies of this Digital Markets Act or variations of it appear in places like Japan, the U.K., Brazil, Mexico, even India... So, I think, in the democratic world, it will become the de facto standard.""""A decade ago, you would have said the tech companies were sort of like teenagers and they really didn't face much regulation. And now they're grown ups and they are going to be regulated -- a little bit like banks, telecoms and other industries that have a tremendous impact on our lives and on the economy,"" he added.The short answer is it depends. Even if gatekeepers do everything that's demanded by their fiercest critics and crack open the gates of their ecosystems to unleash new and exciting opportunities for competitors, it will still require end users to take a sustained interest in alternative apps and services.If there's no uptake, and users prefer to stick with branded wares from familiar tech giants, the DMA's high profile goal of unlocking competition and innovation will fall flat. The Commission itself is well aware of this risk.""What the DMA is really about is to ensure fairness and contestability -- provide for choice and opportunities -- but it's also important that those choices and opportunities are taken up and exercised. Otherwise we may not see changes in every area where we would want to see them because very often it will depend on take up,"" warned Denis Sparas, deputy head of unit at DG CNECT, in the European Commission, during a DMA-focused panel discussion earlier this week organized by the European Digital SME Alliance.""I think there is a ground to be optimistic,"" he added. ""What we see are quite significant improvements, compared to what we have initially seen as the proposed compliance solutions -- and these improvements will result in tangible changes. Having said that, many of these changes also depend on the fact that choices and opportunities which will be provided are also taken up.""Take Google: The tech giant routinely defends itself against charges that it's unfairly self-preferencing its own products at the expense of rivals by claiming its apps are popular simply because they provide users with the best utility. Unsurprisingly, then, it has sought to frame the DMA as anti-user -- suggesting the law will reduce convenience for web users who, it implies, are most likely to find changes it enforces annoying.Apple also maintains that its mobile ecosystem offers users the strongest privacy and security -- similarly arguing, therefore, that the EU regulation is anti-user as it's essentially forcing it to degrade the quality of products it can provide to Europeans.Expect these sorts of arguments to persist. And there is a clear risk of gatekeepers deploying changes in a way that's designed to generate more unwelcome friction for users in a bid to -- both -- undermine support for the regulation and work against the intended competition-boosting effect by making it difficult for people to use alternatives.Add to that, there will be more pop-ups arriving on the back of this EU law -- whether giving users a choice to obtain more privacy by denying platforms' ability to link their data across accounts; letting them pick from a choice of browsers or search engines to set as their default; or warning they're headed 'off world' and transacting elsewhere means they're no longer under the platform's own customer support and refund rules. These notifications will be an obvious target for the law's critics. And may well annoy a bunch of users.It's also quite possible that a lot of web users are happy with what Big Tech provides them. And simply aren't interested in alternatives. But the DMA does at least offer a way to test platform controllers' arguments that they're only popular because they're the best -- and see whether, on a more level playing field, there is appetite for more variety in digital services.A few extra pop-ups seem like a worthwhile trade-off for the chance to reconfigure some of the self-serving incentives that have shaped the commercial web for decades. And even, potentially, reform entirely exploitative business models.One cautionary note here: Years of EU antitrust enforcement on Google has failed to dent its regional market dominance and fire up rival tech like search engines, despite the imposition of interventions like choice screens. However that earlier competition action was undertaken under classic antitrust laws, where enforcement is slow and reactive. Whereas the aim for the DMA is to flip the odds by setting rules up front that outlaw a bunch of unfair lock-in tactics.The bloc hopes this ex ante approach will finally be able to deliver a genuine competition reboot. One aspect hasn't change though: It's still up to gatekeepers to design their own compliance -- so attempts to game the rules or just implement the narrowest possible solutions are a given.That said, given it's already so late to reset Big Tech's market power, the EU is facing huge pressure to act quickly to tackle the most egregious DMA abuses. The Commission is starting on the back foot, facing -- per its own assessment -- a set of entrenched gatekeepers. This should concentrate minds in Brussels on the need to move fast and make DMA enforcement count. But with so much the EU could arbitrate here it's also likely Commission enforcers will pick their battles. So where DMA enforcement falls first will be really interesting to watch -- as it will set the tone for the bloc's approach.Gatekeepers that have opted for a defiant and even aggressive stance (hi Apple!) could just be putting themselves first in the firing line. Gatekeepers whose business models are already subject to charges of systematic non-compliance with EU law (hey Meta!) should also be worried. And while Google may generally play a slicker PR game, it has a very high level of exposure to the DMA on account of how many of its platforms are designated. The EU has also signalled a willingness to contemplate structural remedies in Google's case, warning last year, when it issued a statement of objections for suspected anti-competitive conduct of its adtech business, that the only viable remedy, if a breach of the law ends up being confirmed, is to split Google up.While we'll have to wait and see how exactly DMA enforcement will play out, one thing is clear: There is plenty of appetite in Europe for a crackdown on Big Tech, both among small businesses and web users.""There are some gatekeepers that put certain proposals that are really designed purely in bad faith,"" said Jurgita Misevičiutė, public policy lead at the privacy-focused app maker Proton, during the same panel discussion on the DMA this week. ""We really call on the European Commission... to be really bold and to take swift and strong action against such gatekeepers, because developers, the industry, they don't have another 5 to 10 years to wait until compliance happens.""Asked where it thinks DMA enforcement should fall first, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) told us it wants the Commission to apply ""urgent scrutiny"" on Meta and Apple. “We have real concerns that on D-Day of the Digital Markets Act, some gatekeepers will not comply with the rules they have known about for years now,"" said Agustin Reyna, its director for legal and economic affairs. ""It is really important that the Commission sends a clear signal that this is serious and unacceptable.""Some cases require urgent scrutiny. For example, Meta’s data practices, from what we have seen so far, might violate the DMA, while Apple’s announcements about how they plan to comply with the DMA are clearly insufficient. The Commission has to open infringement proceedings if non-compliant gatekeepers do not adapt their practices immediately.""As noted above, the Commission is under considerable pressure to ensure a flagship digital reform delivers results. So there is absolutely a sense of urgency in Brussels.During Tuesday's SME Alliance panel discussion, DG CNECT's Sparas responded to concerns the Commission may not move quick enough to tackle Big Tech by emphasizing that its thinking on enforcement does not involves timeframes that run to years -- rather he suggested it's going to be a matter of ""days, weeks and months"".The letter of the law states market investigations to consider system non-compliance can take up to 12 months, with up to six months allowed for the Commission to deliver preliminary conclusions. But interim measures may allow for swifter action -- where the Commission determines there is ""urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable damage for business users or end users of gatekeepers"", as the regulation puts it.Also speaking during the SME Alliance panel discussion, Johnny Ryan, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties' senior fellow and director of its Enforce division which focuses on enforcing humans rights on technology, urged the Commission to unbox these interim measures powers stat to tackle long-standing Big Tech abuses.""There is a clear line to how you impose interim measures if you go through the GDPR -- which of course the Commission can under the DMA,"" he suggested. ""I would urge the Commission to be moving as fast as possible... to mark an investigation of systematic non compliance under Article 18(1).""If the EU hits the ground running -- applying interim measures and opening investigations of systematic non-compliance -- it would ""signal with action, not words, that it is fully prepared to take serious measures, including structural remedies"", Ryan added.During the panel, Sparas said the Commission won't always use ""the most far reaching measures"" -- suggesting the EU is hoping the regulation, as a whole, works to reform gatekeepers' behavior simply on merit of having heavily cranked up their regulatory risk.The DMA does allow gatekeepers to offer -- and the Commission to accept -- commitments to address concerns on an ongoing basis, i.e. rather than waiting for formal enforcement. So the EU will want to keep up pressure on platforms to proactively address complaints, such as via the forthcoming public workshops.EU enforcers also have powers to request information and conduction on-site inspections. The bloc can also always raise the temperature by getting commissioners to issue public warnings about issues of concern, as we've seen happening in recent weeks, too, as compliance proposals have emerged.It may be hoping gatekeepers opt to tweak ops in contested areas to avoid the risk of formal DMA proceedings, given the potential for hefty sanctions at the end. And, again in recent days -- so still ahead of the DMA actually applying -- we've seen some instances of editing to compliance proposals in the face of pushback, such as Apple tweaking some of the requirements on developers to take up entitlements. The Commission has also emphasized that proposals have improved vs the first iterations gatekeepers came with last year. So some platform reforms may happen quickly.However, as DMA Compliance Day has loomed, gatekeepers have largely been entrenching on their most heavily criticized positions -- such as Apple and Google's app store fees or Meta's 'consent or pay' model. This suggests the biggest -- potentially most transformative -- reforms of Big Tech business models aren't likely to happen unless the Commission takes formal enforcement. So the baton passes back to the bloc to drive real change.Where non-compliance is ""very blatant"" Sparas emphasized the EU ""will need to act very quickly"".""One thing that we have learned, for good or bad, is that if we want to really make a change here it is very important that we act quickly,"" he said, adding: ""Of course still in a legally sound way. But [we need] to act quickly and effectively. Because otherwise, as we said at the time of the [DMA] proposal, many of these markets are prone to very quick tipping. So... if we take too much time, things may change to a point where it's very difficult to change things back.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/europes-dma-rules-big-tech-140528903.html
2024-03-07T19:19:00.000Z,3 Standout Tech Stocks to Buy Down at Least 15%,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion. ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.Apple (AAPL) Apple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s (NVDA) 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.Block Inc. (SQ)Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.  Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average. The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-07T19:15:33.000Z,Apple M3 MacBook Air review: Still the best Mac for most,"Before we go any further, a question: What makes a computer an AI computer? Is it simply the ability to execute AI-powered tasks? To run LLMs locally? Is it something deeper? Is any computer that is capable of running any form of artificial intelligence/machine learning fundamentally an AI computer?It’s a simple question on the face of it. But the truth is, we’ll probably never have a satisfying answer. Still, it’s important to calibrate as we head deeper into the year of ""AI everything.""If you’ve been playing along at home, you weren’t too surprised when Apple humbly crowned the new M3 MacBook Air as the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI” in a recent press release. The qualifications “laptop” and “consumer” are primarily meant to distinguish the new notebooks from other Apple products, which one assumes are the best AI desktop and laptop, respectively.It's not so much that there’s anything inherent to this update that makes the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air an AI powerhouse, per Apple's description. Rather, it’s the implication that the building blocks have been there the whole time -- specifically in the form of the Neural Engine. This element has been a fixture of Mac silicon for years but often gets overshadowed by the CPU and GPU, which are generally easier for both consumers and reviewers to wrap their brains around.The feature is harder to quantify in terms of real-world performance versus, say, a graphics chip but is perhaps best understood as something along the lines of a GPU targeting machine learning. It's been clear for some time that this will be an increasingly essential aspect of day-to-day computing, a fact that the arrival of ChatGPT and its ilk has brought into sharp focus for many consumers.Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is leaning so heavily into the concept for the same reason Samsung positioned the S24 as the industry’s first “AI phone” and why Google referred to the Pixel 8 Pro as “the first smartphone with AI built in” last year: zeitgeist. These are marketing concepts to a large extent, but they're a good barometer for where the industry's collective head is at.The sudden explosion of generative AI has transformed artificial intelligence from abstract and theoretical to concrete and tangible for many. Naturally, everyone wants a piece of it. You can expect Apple to lean into the notion even more heavily when the iPhone 16 launches later this year. After all, machine learning has been an important aspect of features like computational photography for some time.As of right now, however, Apple can’t tell exactly the story it wants to tell. The company's generative AI narrative is -- at the moment -- one of delayed gratification. During Apple’s most recent quarterly earnings call, Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” in the generative AI field, adding, “We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is no doubt investing boatloads into the category, even funneling members of its ill-fated automotive team into the space. Given the head start currently enjoyed by the competition, however, hardware is something Apple can point to in the here and now. Some of this also likely stems from the fact that the new Airs aren’t fundamentally new pieces of hardware. Rather, they’re refreshes with new(ish) silicon.That’s to be expected. The Mac line has seen a LOT of change over the past four years. All of that work came together in a brilliant way with last year’s Air models. I don’t hesitate to call them the best consumer laptop Apple has ever made. Depending on where your operating system allegiances lie, it’s not a stretch to call them the best laptops for most people, full stop. They’re not perfect -- sacrificing certain “Pro” features for the sake of weight and size has been a longtime feature of the line -- but many or most of them are things the average consumer won’t realize are missing.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe 2023 Air benefited greatly from Apple’s work on first-party silicon through the M line of chips, coupled with learning from past stumbles like faulty keyboards and the largely DOA Touch Bar. The end product felt like precisely the MacBook so many of us wanted for so long: lightweight and powerful, with great battery life and a reasonable (in Mac terms) price point, starting at $1,099 for the 13- and $1,299 for the 15-inch. If anything, the line has cemented the Pro as a niche product by comparison, as the Air has replaced the standard MacBook as the model for most.As a professional writer, I consider myself to be in a fairly creative field. I record and edit podcasts every week, along with the occasional video. I get to test all sorts of laptops for this gig, and I keep coming back to the Air. Certainly my frequent work travel plays a considerable role in the tech I choose, along with some newfound degenerative back problems.For my money, the 15-inch model gracefully balances the line between screen size and portability. At 3.3 pounds, it never felt like a burden carrying on my back all last week at Mobile World Congress and (don’t tell the Delta flight attendant), it sits comfortably in the seatback pocket.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThere are really only two things that make me miss the Pro at all. The first is the port problem. Both Air models have a pair of USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports next to the MagSafe connector. There are times when things get bunched up over there, making me miss the 16-inch Pro’s three ports. That in itself isn’t enough to get me to switch. Nor, for that matter, are the times I miss having an SD slot. Dongles are a pain, but they’re very much part of the modern condition in Apple land. If I was constantly shooting with an SLR, however, I would likely be telling a different story.Now, the port math changes considerably depending on your home/office setup. I’m lucky (or, perhaps, foolish) enough to have a desktop system at home. Much like the Pro models, this is probably overkill for many or most, especially when factoring in (1) cost and (2) the fact that the M3 chip has support for two external monitors.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe iPad may have eaten into Mac's market share among more casual users, but as the laptop line has gotten more powerful, it's supplanted the need for a devoted desktop for many. There's great versatility in a device you can travel the world with, take home and dock into a pair of external monitors. In the case of the Studio Display, the process is as simple as connecting to the Thunderbolt port and closing the laptop hood. Not much configuration is needed beyond that, and suddenly you've got a ton of screen real estate and an array of freed up ports on the backs of the monitors.Given the power and performance of even the standard M3, there really is not a compelling reason not to. This is one of the great paradoxes of Apple silicon: The more powerful it becomes at the base, the more niche the high-end devices become for most users.The only real caveat to all of this is gaming. Apple would never have admitted it, but the $300 billion-odd industry has been an afterthought for most of the Mac’s life. In spite of an early advantage, Apple was lapped and ultimately left behind by the industry. For decades, gaming on the Mac seemed like a lost cause. If you wanted to play anything much more complicated than solitaire, you bought a Windows machine or console. This isn’t to say that Apple’s caught up by any meaningful metric (the gaming library still can't hold a candle to Windows), but a combination of first-party silicon, Metal and development for the iPhone has, at the very least, put the company back in the conversation for those who want to move beyond mobile.If gaming is your number one raison d'être, a Mac probably isn’t on your list. If, however, AAA gaming is a slice of your overall computer needs, you can reasonably have that itch scratched. It’s true that the macOS library still pales in comparison to Windows, but Apple has begun remedying that with some day and date releases from big-name studios.Image Credits: AppleThe M3 arrived last year as part of Apple’s “Scary Fast” (it was the day before Halloween, mind) event. The company bucked its standard silicon release cadence by introducing three versions at once: the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. One gets the sense that ramping up production, coupled with the ongoing supply chain issues of the past four years, has done a number on the release road map.A refreshed 24-inch iMac was the recipient of the base M3, while new MacBook Pros got the M3, Pro and Max. The base M3 features an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU (upgradable to 10-core) and 16-core neural engine. Both the 13- and 15-inch models have 8GB of RAM by default, configurable up to 24GB. Likewise, the 256GB of storage goes up to 2TB.Image Credits: Brian HeaterIn fact, beyond display size (technically 13.6- and 15.3-inch, respectively) and starting price, there’s not much in the way of distinction between the two machines. This much was clear last year, when the 15-inch model was announced several months after the 13-inch, sporting the same M2 chip. This joint announcement puts the two models on the same refresh cycle, where they should be.Even more pronounced is the very narrow gulf between the base 15-inch Air and 14-inch Pro. The specs are near-identical across the board, save for stated 22 hours of battery to the Air models’ 18 hours (you have more room to navigate with a thicker, heavier machine). The Pro also sports a Liquid Retina XDR display, which packs 3024 x 1964 pixels into less screen real estate than the Air’s 2880 x 1864.It’s hard to recommend the base Pro over the Air. The math changes if you feel the need to upgrade to the M3 Pro, however. At that point you’ll also want to factor in the fact that (somewhat ironically) the Airs are fanless, meaning there’s going to be a thermal bottleneck when you really start pushing the machine. That said, Apple loves to point out how difficult it is to trigger the fan during daily use, meaning most Air users won’t be bothered by its absence most of the time.Image Credits: Brian HeaterWhen it arrived last year, we declared the 13-inch the best MacBook for most. Since then, it only saw a true challenger in the form of the 15-inch model, which has since become my daily driver. The Air inherited the throne of true mainstream devices from the standard MacBook, and as they've flourished, Pro models have increasingly shifted to the margin. The only major change here is the upgraded chip, making the 2024 model little more than a refresh.In the world of consumer electronics, that's to be expected. Apple created the best-ever MacBook with the 2023 Air. It was a perfect storm of powerful silicon, great industrial design and lessons learned from recent hardware stumbles. Given all that, it's ultimately for the best that the company stuck to the formula here. As for the whole “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI"" bit -- that's pure marketing. Intel made the same claim at the end of last year with its new Meteor Lake chips.As far as generative AI's current consumer reach, most modern laptops and phones are -- at very least -- serviceable. For now, the conversation largely centers on future-proofing systems for the great leaps to come. It's certainly something top of mind for Apple, as the company looks to make its first major announcements on the subject later this year (June's WWDC seems as good a time as any).Great strides have been made in bringing generative AI to consumers. The day-to-day usefulness of such platforms is another question entirely, but getting the most out of them will require capable machines, and the new Airs fit the bill. There's novelty in the ability to run large language models (LLMs) locally, though most consumers will continue to rely on cloud-based processing when they use these models.Programmers who really want to dive in will likely be eyeing Pro models and other high-end machines. For most consumers, however, the Air continues to be the best MacBook -- and it's not even close.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-macbook-air-m3-review/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-m3-macbook-air-review-140029672.html

2024-03-07T17:37:22.000Z,EU regulators take an interest in Apple-Epic Games dispute,"European Union (EU) regulators seek to question Apple (AAPL) over the tech giant's termination of the Epic Games Store from its App Store. European officials view this to be in violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest in the legal conflict between the Fortnite creator and Apple.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Apple is facing more regulatory scrutiny. EU regulators are set to question Apple on its recent feud with Epic Games and its App Store rules. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley to give us the details. So Dan, walk us through where we are now and how we got here.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So we'll start from how we got here. This basically all comes back to Epic Games and Apple's showdown where Epic wanted to provide consumers with a third party means of purchasing items inside of games. Apple doesn't allow that through the App Store. When Epic went ahead and did that on their own, Apple basically pulled Fortnite and suspended Epic Games from being able to use the App Store.Epic, knowing that this would happen, sued Apple. And then basically in California, what ended up happening was Apple was not found to be a monopolist, but it did have what the court said were some anti-steering rules. And so they had to address those.Now, where this recent spat comes from is the EU and the Digital Markets Act. And Apple basically says that look, we can't trust Epic. We need to put in place a kind of a block from them. We're not going to let them use our platforms because of the prior issues we've had with them. And Epic saying, look, the Digital Markets Act, which allows for third party app stores on things like iOS is in place, and we should be allowed to put our App Store there.So what we're hearing from the two companies is basically obviously completely opposite. So first, we have a statement from Epic where they say, ""Apple is taking one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store,"" which would be that Epic Games Store. ""They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.""Now, essentially what Epic is saying there is, look, CEO Tim Sweeney went ahead, criticized Apple and its Digital Markets Act maneuvers as well as its moves in the US. And they're saying that that's why Apple is not letting Epic run any App Store on iOS in the EU.Now, Apple on the flip side had this to say. Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate any or all of Epic Games', wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games control at any time. Apple chose to exercise that right.""That comes from that California court ruling. And so you know how that exactly plays out with the EU, I don't know. But it really comes down to two companies that are just at loggerheads over what they believe they should be allowed to do on iOS. And for Apple, they're not going to give this up, obviously. This is something that they're going to hold onto.They're trying to make moves that allow them to continue to remain in control of iOS and the App Store. And for Epic, look, they have a mountain of money from Fortnite, and so they're going to go ahead and continue to fight this as well. What it ends up doing is making Apple look bad and making Epic look bad so we'll see if either or decides to pull back or doesn't or if the EU makes some decision. Now, they're starting to probe Apple on its decision to pull Epic Games' ability to put games onto the App Store in the EU.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a legal battle when you consider the California ruling versus what the EU is looking at in terms of the disproportionate or proportionate reaction that Apple had. Are we expecting to see more of these sorts of these challenges when it comes to the App Store and Apple trying to maintain its dominance while still trying to stay within the rules here?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, when it comes to the $2 billion that they were fined from the EU over Apple Music and Spotify, Apple says that they're going to appeal that. And so clearly, they're not going to just take this lying down. They're going to continue to try to I guess work through what the EU's rules are but to the limit, right? And so that appears to be what they're intent on doing.They don't want to give up making money off of the App Store or the way they do now through commissions from developers when there's sales of their products or apps themselves. And so you got to imagine that they're going to continue to try to fight this as much as they can while still sticking to the law.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/eu-regulators-takes-interest-apple-173722879.html

2024-03-07T16:59:28.000Z,Welcome to the Digital Markets Act. Here’s what you need to know about the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law,"Europe’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) finally started hitting Big Tech with tough antitrust obligations today. And what better way to understand its impact than to look at how tech firms have moved to comply—and to take advantage of new opportunities?But first, here’s what happens if these so-called gatekeepers—which so far include Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok parent ByteDance—don’t comply. They can get hit with fines of up to 10% of global annual revenue. If they keep breaking the rules, those fines can rise to 20%, and the European Commission can even break businesses up or block them from buying other companies relating to whatever naughtiness is concerned.It’s worth noting that, in light of how weak enforcement by underfunded national regulators undermined the bite of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, which deals with privacy, the Commission has decided to enforce the DMA itself. The same goes for its sister law, the Digital Services Act, which mostly deals with content-moderation issues. It remains to be seen whether the Commission has the resources to do this effectively for either law, but that’s the plan.Got that? Cool. Let’s proceed with the changes themselves—and remember, these are Europe-only.Moving easily to rival services. Many companies have been letting users download their data for years now, but now they’re going beyond that. For example, Google and TikTok owner ByteDance have launched data portability APIs so users can give other developers permission to directly import their data from the gatekeepers’ services—handy for switching service providers, but also potentially for backing up their data.Freedom from default choices. Remember when Microsoft was once forced to tell Windows users that they had browser options beyond Internet Explorer, like Google’s Chrome? Now Chrome will tell its users that they have other search engine options. And Google will also give Android users a choice of browsers and search engines when they set up their device.More control over data privacy. Continuing the inexorable bleeding together of data-protection and competition law, people now get to decide if one of these Big Tech conglomerates can keep linking together the data from accounts users have with its various services—something that has big implications for user profiling and ad targeting. So Meta now lets people decouple Facebook and Instagram accounts, and Google does the same for YouTube, Search, and its many other services.Choice of in-app payment services. Google and Apple now let app developers deploy third-party payment mechanisms that aren’t Google Pay and Apple Pay. Google mostly did this in 2022 already, though it’s only now fully expanded the program to game developers. Apple left everything until the last minute. But hey, third-party developers can actually access the iPhone’s NFC tap-to-pay chip now!Interoperability of services. Gatekeepers don’t have to make their services interoperable with just anyone—nobody wants security to go out the window—but they do need to allow it in principle. So, for example, users of Meta’s WhatsApp will soon be able to talk to people on other messaging platforms. (Meta is trying to avoid the same obligation for its Messenger service.)Business data transparency. Business customers of these platforms can now demand easier access to the data they generate. This looks set to have a real impact in the advertising space, as both Google and Amazon are now promising to give advertisers and publishers more data.No more anti-steering. Well hello there, Apple. Days after the company was fined $2 billion for refusing to let Spotify and other streaming services inform their iOS users about cheaper off-platform subscription deals, the new rules demand more clearly that gatekeepers let business users “promote offers and conclude contracts with customers outside the gatekeeper’s platform.” So that’s definitely now a thing, although Google is trying the interesting tactic of claiming fat fees for these “external offers,” as it calls them. I imagine developers will complain to the Commission about that. But speaking of Apple …Third-party app stores. Google already allowed third-party app stores on Android, and as of now, Apple must do the same on iOS. The first third party, whose German developers have promised a launch as soon as the DMA comes into force (it isn’t live yet), is Mobivention, which focuses on the enterprise market. MacPaw’s Setapp should follow in April.However, Apple celebrated the advent of the DMA by denying archnemesis Epic Games’ attempt to launch a European iOS app store and bring Fortnite back to European iPhones. I don’t have space to explain why here—but you can find my comprehensive explainer here. Tl;dr: Apple’s DMA-compliance hissy fit over the past couple months has somehow become even more outrageous, and it’s unlikely to pay off for the company. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just released a video celebrating the advent of the DMA, and it pointedly referred to Fortnite returning to iOS. I checked with her staff, and she definitely recorded it after Apple’s latest tantrum.More news below.David MeyerWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/welcome-digital-markets-act-know-165928358.html

We did it again. That's the opening bell on Wall Street and at the NASDAQ in Midtown Manhattan where they've got some funfetti because it's a day that ends in Y, Pentair ringing the opening bell at the NYSE, ticker symbol PNT. And in Midtown Manhattan you've got we're going to go with Energem.- OK. I like that pronunciation.- You like that one?- Yeah.- OK. All right, we'll stick with that one for now. We'll workshop it a little bit here in the break. We've got team coverage of the biggest market movers following the opening bell on Wall Street standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. We've got Jay Woods alongside Madison Mills and Jared Blikre, who is here at the Wi-Fi interactive on standby,Madison, just 30 minutes before Fed Chair Jay Powell's second day of congressional testimony kicks off, what are you hearing around the exchange?- Well, Brad, I'm here with Jay Woods, who I'd love to get that quote of what you just said. What did you say when you just turned to the boards?- I said, we're ripping.- What's going on?- Hey, did I curse? If I did, I don't want to quote that. What's going on-- we're having a nice day here. Remember Monday and Tuesday when we sold off? This is the third time we've had close to a 2% selloff from the top of the S&P 500. We haven't had a 2% selloff in now, I believe, 90 days, where there have only been six streaks longer, which is quite impressive.And every time you think we're going to give a little bit back, the buyers step in and we're stepping in again despite Powell's testimony where we're going to be a little higher for longer. So this market's resilient and, yeah, it's pretty amazing to see.- So we had the selloff, and then we have this catalyst for growth. What is driving this growth that we're still seeing off of that selloff?- Well, we're seeing a rotation. We had a good earnings season. We got through that. We still have a few coming out later today, but 99% are done. So let's say we're done.And now, we're waiting for that next catalyst. What's that going to be? I think it's going to be the CPI next week, unemployment tomorrow. But right now, despite inflation still being a little sticky and higher for longer, the market is resilient, and the broadening out, we're seeing the Russell still continue to do well.Health care, industrials, materials, those are doing well, despite some of the Mag Seven, three of them in particular-- Tesla, Apple, and Google-- down for the year. Tesla down over 20%, Apple down over 10%. That usually scares this market. It's not, so something's changed, and it's a good narrative.- If you're an investor who has those three names that you mentioned and maybe even I would throw in a Microsoft-- they're kind of surviving, but I feel like they're not thriving the way the other top three in the seven are-- what's your advice to them? What should they be thinking about and framing their thinking on? Should they be panicking right now?- Well, if that's their only stock holding, yeah, I'd be a little nervous because you're missing out on the rest of the rally. But, I mean, Apple has proven time and time again that any pause, any stop in their uptrend is probably a good buying opportunity.Tesla a little different. Google, they have some AI concerns, but Google has always figured it out as well. So what it is just a rotation, and people are going to different asset classes, whether it's Bitcoin and gold-- which are making all-time highs. It's crazy-- or some of the other smaller stocks that have not participated yet in the rally.And then you have AI. It just doesn't slow down. NVIDIA over 900 this morning. Crazy.- When you look at AI plays, I was just talking about Micron Technology, what should investors be looking at in terms of the fundamentals, the balance sheet on these companies to suss out where they can afford to play AI if they can't get in on NVIDIA?- Yeah, well, I mean, you can buy the SMH, the Semiconductor Index, that's a best way to have a basket of stocks that are all AI related. NVIDIA definitely the best in class. Who's the next one up? We have Broadcom earnings after the close today. It's going to be interesting to see what they do.NVIDIA was up 260% coming into this week over 52 weeks. You know, Broadcom symbol AVGO was up 135%, so you do have stocks that are making tremendous runs in AI, but NVIDIA just outshines everybody. It's best in class, and it's best in class for a reason. They keep raising the bar.The AI story, as Dan Ives always says-- I know he's been on your network and talked to you guys in the studio-- it's still early innings, and I believe Dan Ives. And you just have to be selective. If you want to get in, buy a basket. It's the best way to play it.- All right. Buy that basket. Thank you so much, Jay. We really appreciate you. As always, Brad and Seana, I'll toss it back to you guys in the studio.- All right. Thanks so much, Maddy, and thanks, Jay, for telling us how to play the movement that we're seeing to the upside. Buy the basket.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/stocks-rip-higher-off-shifting-150753693.html

2024-03-07T12:37:23.000Z,"‘A serious violation’: Why Apple just killed off Epic’s EU app store, and why the Fortnite maker will probably prevail","To mark the moment the European Union’s new Big Tech antitrust law comes into force, Tim Cook’s Apple has decided to test its limits with an extraordinary escalation of its long-running feud with Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games.The Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduces many new obligations for so-called “gatekeeper” services that link businesses and consumers, and the iPhone operating system iOS and its App Store have both been classified as such.So, as of Thursday, Apple is obliged to allow third-party app stores on iPhones—a shift that will allow developers to distribute apps without having to give Apple a fat cut of transactions conducted within them.Epic was planning to become one of the first big players to launch an iOS app store, but on Wednesday the Fortnite maker revealed that Apple had blocked the move by terminating the developer account that Epic’s Swedish affiliate had set up to launch the store, and that provides Epic games on Apple's own App Store.“This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,” Epic wrote in a blog post. “In terminating Epic’s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.”The revelation quickly drew a response from the European Commission, which will be directly enforcing the DMA, and which said it had asked Apple for “further explanations” under the new law.To understand what just happened, one needs to rewind to the start of the decade when Epic and Apple began their feud over the issue of in-app payments, which have traditionally earned Apple a 30% cut on the iOS platform.Epic, which had long protested this cut, deliberately made changes in the iOS version of Fortnite in August 2020 so that in-app purchases could bypass Apple’s payment system in favor of Epic’s own.This broke Apple’s policy, but Epic claimed it was doing so to pass on savings to its users.Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store. Epic sued. Apple countersued and (mostly) won that fight, with a Californian court ruling in September 2021 that Apple has the right to terminate any Epic-affiliated developer account at its “sole discretion.”Epic had to pay Apple $3.65 million in breach-of-contract damages. (Apple also recently launched an attempt to claim over $73 million in legal fees stemming from the case, which Epic is furiously resisting.)Fast-forward to late January of this year.With the DMA’s debut little more than a month away, Apple announced it would allow third-party iOS app stores, but that any developer distributing an app through the new channels would have to pay a new €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” for every first installation of that app, whether that installation takes place via the third-party store or Apple’s own App Store.Downloads of the alternative app stores themselves would also trigger the fee, to be paid by the developers of the app stores.Apple’s move earned an apoplectic reaction from many companies that were planning to launch their own iOS app stores—Meta and Microsoft are heavily lobbying Brussels to decide it is not compliant with the DMA—but Epic CEO Sweeney was the first to voice loud criticism.“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under [the] DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads,” Sweeney wrote on X on Jan. 25.Despite its protests about Apple’s “malicious compliance” with the DMA, Epic said it would take up Apple’s terms and launch an iOS app store in Europe.However, on Feb. 23, Apple executive Phil Schiller wrote to Sweeney—Epic yesterday published the email exchange—to point out that Epic had previously “entered into agreements with Apple and then broken them.”Schiller highlighted Sweeney’s “colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan” and said it “strongly” suggested Epic was going to again break its developer contract with Apple.Schiller asked Sweeney for “written assurance that you are also acting in good faith, and that Epic Games Sweden will, despite your public actions and rhetoric, honor all of its commitments.”Sweeney quickly responded: “Epic and its subsidiaries are acting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple, and we’ll be glad to provide Apple with any specific further assurances on the topic that you’d like.”Three days later, Sweeney again took to X to accuse Apple of “contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies,” adding that his rival was “a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers, and overlord to none.”In a Mar. 2 legal letter that Epic published yesterday, Apple referenced this post as partial justification for its decision to cancel the developer account of Epic Games Sweden, which was to operate the mobile Epic Games Store and Fortnite in Europe.In the letter, Apple’s lawyers said Sweeney’s “litany of public attacks on Apple’s policies, compliance plan, and business model” had “undercut” his “minimal assurances” to Schiller. Citing the 2021 Californian ruling that gave Apple the right to unilaterally cancel any Epic developer agreements, they announced Apple was doing just that.“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,” Apple said in a statement.In its post yesterday, Epic said Apple was “undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.”Apple will probably have a tough time convincing the Commission that an American court ruling gives it the right to undermine a key plank of the DMA just as the new law comes into force.For a start, Apple’s whole approach to DMA compliance—the very thing Sweeney was loudly protesting—has been downright petulant.When it announced the changes it was making to comply, Apple did so while complaining they “bring greater risks to users and developers.”Then, in February, Apple used another new demand of the DMA—that it allows the developers of third-party browsers such as Chrome to avoid using Apple’s WebKit browser engine—as an excuse to kill off home-screen web apps on iOS, again in the name of security.This would have removed another avenue for developers who want to avoid Apple’s in-app payments cut, and the Commission swiftly threatened an investigation, forcing Apple to reverse its plan.Then, wrapping up a pre-DMA case in which Spotify was the complainant, the Commission on Monday hit Apple with a $2 billion fine for stopping streaming-app developers from telling their iOS users that they can get cheaper subscriptions outside Apple’s platform—which is possible because, yet again, it’s a way to avoid Apple taking a huge cut of the subscription fee.Apple has to drop these “anti-steering” tactics anyway under the DMA and, as it announced its appeal, it accused the Commission of trying to “enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law.” It also accused Spotify and the Commission of “coordinating” in the case.So Apple and the Commission were already at war before this latest Epic episode.Reacting to Epic’s revelation, the Commission didn’t just say it was looking into the matter under the DMA—it also said it was “evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with two other laws, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Platform-to-Business (P2B) Regulation.The still-quite-new DSA is a sister law to the DMA, covering platforms’ content rather than their competitive practices—it’s the law under which the Commission recently started investigating X (regarding disinformation) and TikTok (regarding child protection and ad transparency.)In this case, the Commission wants to know whether Apple shutting down Epic Games Sweden’s developer account was a violation.“The DSA sets a requirement for clear, transparent terms and conditions, no arbitrary application of these terms and conditions, provision of statements of reasons in case a decision is taken, and the possibility for complaints and redress,” a Commission spokesperson said in an email. “If content is moderated and accounts are temporarily suspended or permanently terminated, this needs to be proportionate and in due regard to fundamental rights.”As for the P2B Regulation, the issue is that a platform has to “notify a business user…before an account is terminated,” the spokesperson said. It’s not hard to see how Apple may have failed this test when its lawyers sent Epic that letter telling it that its Swedish developer account had been terminated “effective immediately.”But perhaps the biggest problem with Apple’s justification for nixing Epic’s app store is the fact that Sweeney’s criticism of Apple’s rules is something that the Commission effectively solicited.It has been clear throughout the last few months that the changes companies make to comply with the DMA will be evaluated while taking account of “market feedback”—it wants affected companies to say their piece, and now Apple is punishing Epic for doing just that.The Commission still hasn’t said what it thinks of Apple’s new “core technology fee,” but it was never going to do that before Thursday anyway. With the way Apple has conducted itself in recent weeks, it’s hard to see how the company isn’t cruising for a bruising.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/serious-violation-why-apple-just-123723171.html

2024-03-07T12:00:00.000Z,Apple highlights iPhone 15 Pro in live-action manga film,"Apple has extended its long-running “Shot on iPhone” campaign with a live-action adaptation of manga series “Midnight,” according to details shared with Marketing Dive. The film first debuted in Tokyo.The 19-minute suspense drama tells the story of a taxi driver who is pulled out of his way to assist a truck driver on the run from a hitman. The film, shot in the dark streets of Tokyo, showcases the capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.The full film, available on YouTube, is being released on Abema TV and Apple TV on March 7 and will be played in select Tokyo taxis from 10 p.m. until morning. The effort will also be supported by broadcast, magazine, out-of-home (OOH), digital OOH, digital and social.Apple’s ongoing “Shot on iPhone” campaign has captured moments from a variety of touchpoints over the years, whether it be the work of student filmmakers or a music video for pop star Olivia Rodrigo, in an attempt to showcase the creative capabilities of the iPhone. For its latest effort, the tech giant is tapping into pop-culture hype surrounding manga, a move that could help it engage with consumers while highlighting what the iPhone 15 Pro has to offer.Apple’s “Midnight” is a live-action adaptation of the popular 1986 manga series written by Osamu Tezuka. The 19-minute film, shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro, tells the story of a taxi driver and the strange passengers he meets while making late-night rounds before encountering truck driver Kaede, who is on the run from a hitman. The adaptation, which blends original manga strips created by Tezuka, was written by Yusuke Watanabe, a TV, anime and film screenwriter, and directed by Takashi Miike (“Audition”).The “Midnight” film was shot in a way that could highlight the low-light and cinematic capabilities of the iPhone 15 Pro. Notably, the film combines live-action shots with CGI while utilizing the phone’s LiDAR scanner in post production to create the 3D model base for the taxi and its staple fifth wheel. The film is also meant to showcase the iPhone 15 Pro’s attention to detail and its stabilization capabilities, as seen during the live-action fighting shots, per release information. The effort was handled by TBWA\Media Arts Lab Tokyo.The latest cultural play by Apple is a likely attempt to boost sales momentum of the iPhone, which CEO Tim Cook credited for the company’s strong results in its latest quarter, though the iPhone 15 in some areas has recently seen weak demand. The tech giant reported revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 that ended Dec. 30, per its most recent earnings statement.The “Midnight” film was shared to YouTube on March 6 and will premiere on Apple TV and Japanese streaming service Abema TV on March 7. Additionally, the original manga magazine will feature characters from the film on the cover of its March issue. A number of additional channels will support the effort, including with the film and behind-the-scenes content being played in select taxis across Tokyo during the evening hours, which could help Apple capture the attention of consumers who aren’t directly seeking it out.Along with Apple, a handful of others have similarly tapped into hype around anime and manga in hopes of striking a stronger consumer connection. In February, McDonald’s launched a campaign and “WcDonald’s” push inspired by how the brand is often depicted in anime and manga that included a new sauce, packaging and episodic content. In another example, Ikea last year launched a TikTok campaign aimed at Gen Z consumers that turned college moments into anime art.This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

2024-03-07T11:43:00.000Z,Microsoft’s AI Gold Rush: Boom or Bubble Waiting to Burst?,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s most valuable company. It’s a fact that I’m sure MSFT stock investors love.But does it deserve to be?Compare it to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which it passed in market cap recently, and you can see it’s a momentum play. Apple had sales of $383 billion last year. Microsoft’s were $211 billion. Apple reported $96 billion of that revenue as net income. MSFT stock reported $72 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat makes the difference is that Apple revenues were higher in 2022 than 2023. Microsoft’s grew about 8%. Microsoft should continue that growth this year. Apple’s revenues are now expected to decline.MSFT stock is in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) sweet spot. It controls OpenAI, and its Co-Pilot is already drawing enormous revenue. AI is driving today’s stock market.That should mean 14% growth according to analysts. We’re talking about $257 billion in fiscal 2025 revenue (Microsoft’s fiscal year starts in July), against $225 billion expected for 2024. Profit growth is also expected to be 14%.If you’re buying Microsoft stock today, you consider those estimates low. Microsoft’s Azure cloud is taking market share from Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN). Microsoft has successfully tied Generative AI to its software suite. This is in contrast to the situation at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), where search and AI are competing for resources.MSFT stock has also, so far, dodged some of the antitrust problems that now bedevil Google. Thank its own antitrust history, where it lost over a decade of progress to consent decrees. The Cloud Czar built by CEO Satya Nadella is a complete reinvention of the company, a process Microsoft’s rivals have barely begun. Remember, the company built by Bill Gates was based on software packed in boxes and installed by users.Life isn’t all gravy at Microsoft these days.Getting the cost balance right between cloud and programming is a challenge.This is illustrated by what’s happening now in my hometown of Atlanta. Microsoft just bought land to expand its data center southwest of the city. At the same time, it has stalled the development of a planned office complex near downtown and the city wants its land back. The blowback may include higher taxes.Microsoft put $22.7 billion into capital spending during the first two quarters of this year. It’s on pace to blow away last year’s record capital spending of $31.9 billion.That’s why Microsoft laid off 1,900 gaming employees recently. It laid off over 10,000 people last year. It’s raising prices wherever it can.For every two programmers it lets go, Microsoft may only be able to afford one GenAI programmer. The average programmer in the U.S. today is earning about $29 per hour, or $60,000 per year. If they’re working on Generative AI, the pay can be twice that.Even the Kings of AI face hard choices, between investing in people and investing in things.Microsoft is doing big business in AI tools and cloud capacity. Not all of it is being done in cash. Much of the money it has put into OpenAI and, more recently, into Mistral, is in the form of Azure credits. These decisions limit the benefits Microsoft will get from GenAI applications, even while they raise the hackles of antitrust authorities.Those concerns are serious. Microsoft’s attempt to sidestep European regulators, separating its Teams and Office suites, failed to satisfy them. Europe is looking into its security software and even the OpenAI deal.That doesn’t mean you should sell your Microsoft stock. But the current Price to Earnings (PE) multiple of over 36, and a yield of under .75%, means it’s fully valued. You’re bumping against a ceiling, and that ceiling isn’t rising fast enough to keep future downdrafts away.I’d wait for those downdrafts before buying more.As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, and AMZN.

2024-03-07T13:53:54.000Z,"UPDATE 3-As Big Tech scrambles to meet EU rules, investigations seen as likely","(Adds Amazon comment, details)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - The world's biggest tech companies have overhauled their core platform services to comply with EU rules forcing them to play fairer with rivals but will likely face investigations ahead amid criticism their efforts may have fallen short.The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called ""Big Tech"" - Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance - and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth.Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.If any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.The European Commission's reaction to the compliance efforts could take several months as they review the changes and build up a watertight case able to withstand a legal challenge.Apple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.Yet its introduction of new fees such as a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.Vestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.Rivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough. The Commission declined to comment.With eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet's Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.The company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking.com and Expedia, which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.That has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries. Google declined to comment.Meta, which said Instagram and Facebook users will be asked if their data can be shared between its services, could also run the risk of an investigation. Meta declined to comment.Microsoft, Amazon and ByteDance may face less scrutiny initially as EU regulators focus their resources on one or two cases and ensure a case able to withstand a legal challenge, people familiar with the matter said.Amazon said it had engaged constructively with the EU regulator on the DMA.""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment,"" a spokesperson said.Microsoft and ByteDance declined to comment.Pressure for an EU investigation is also coming from the some of the big six companies themselves.At least one has told the European Commission that it was not fair to have to play by the DMA rules while a rival flouts them, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.Unlike EU antitrust investigations which can take years to wrap, DMA enforcers have just a year to issue their findings.($1 = 0.9173 euros) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith, Jamie Freed and David Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/1-big-tech-scrambles-meet-113329438.html
2024-03-07T18:08:27.000Z,European regulators want to question Apple after it blocks Epic Games app store,"LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said they want to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store, in a possible violation of digital rules that took effect in the 27-nation bloc Thursday.It's a fresh escalation of the high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent years fighting Apple’s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps.Epic asserted Wednesday that Apple thwarted its attempt to set up its own iOS app marketplace to compete with Apple's App Store, calling it a breach of the EU's new Digital Markets Act.The sweeping set of rules, designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant — a move it's long resisted.The European Commission, the EU's top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement Thursday that it has “requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.” The rules threaten penalties that could reach into the billions for violations.Apple has already been hit this week with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting music streaming competition.The commission said it's “also evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU regulations including the Digital Services Act, a second set of regulations in the bloc's digital rulebook that prohibit tech companies from ”arbitrary application"" of their terms and conditions.Epic contended that Apple was brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store that it planned to set up in Sweden to serve European Union users.It accused Apple of retaliating for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.Apple said its action was justified because of Epic's previous unlawful actions and litigation that resulted in the U.S. court decision in 2021.Apple ousted Epic from its App Store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users, while also helping recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world’s most ubiquitous devices.“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,'"" Apple said in a statement.

2024-03-07T11:15:00.000Z,3 Bargain Buffett Stocks to Buy Before They Rebound,"Warren Buffett is widely considered to be the greatest investor of all time. The man has amassed an incredible Fortune from the stock market. Yet he is not infallible, nor does every trade that he makes win. Indeed, if you know where to look there are several bargain Buffett stocks to buy.A look at his current portfolio indicates as much. There are multiple positions which, if sold today, would result in substantial losses. Given that Warren Buffett himself has purchased these stocks at higher prices there is reason to believe that they hold substantial rebound potential.Beyond that, market dynamics could very easily shift in favor of all of the stocks below. Remember, Warren Buffett broadly invests in the strength of the U.S. economy as a guiding force. There are multiple reasons to believe that the economy could improve from here which would propel those shares higher. Bearing all of that in mind, let’s take a look at these bargain Buffett stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is getting hammered as I write this. In fact, the stock is experiencing its worst day in its history.The company is dealing with difficulties on multiple fronts and the markets are responding in kind. that resulted in shares dropping by 19% on the day. One reason for the terrible performance is that CEO Frank Slootman announced he will retire. He will be replaced by a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) ad chief Sridhar Ramaswamy.Additionally, sales guidance from the company was slightly below what analysts had been expecting. Operating margin guidance of 3% was well below the 7.2% analysts have been expecting. Broadly speaking, the news was negatively received yet some pundits perceive the news as a net positive. Macquarie Equity Research upgraded its target price from $182 to $205.The average buying price of a Warren Buffett is just above $238. This looks like a good entry point from a contrarian perspective. Remember, snowflake is a growth stock at heart and once rate cuts are enacted it should jump higher again. Revenues grew by 33% during Q4.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most important of all Warren Buffett stocks. It represents 47.5% of his overall holdings. It’s also down over the last few weeks having fallen from $195 to $181 at present. That makes it a potential rebound stock and generally speaking, investing in Apple when it falls is a good idea.It’s no secret that many of the other leading Silicon Valley firms have better invested in artificial intelligence than Apple. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google all fit within that category.The result is that shares are trading at levels last seen in early November. Apple also announced that it is winding down the apple car project, long expected to boost the firm. I personally think it’s a good decision but that’s not particularly important.What is important is that Apple is currently expected to make major AI announcements in June. The money from the shuttered Apple Car Projects can now be directed into AI. That’s a big bonus. I think it’s a great time to be investing in AAPL.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett recently increased his stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) by 1.8%. That should be a good enough reason for investors to consider it as well. Buffet has been investing in the oil company for the last few years.Generally speaking, anytime Buffett invests in an oil company it’s a reasonable signal that he believes the price of crude oil will rise. Yet, that isn’t the only reason Buffett likes Occidental Petroleum.The company generates the majority of its revenues from drilling operations. It also operates chemical plants and refineries. In short, its integrated structure allows it to benefit more substantially when the spot price of oil rises.Beyond that, there are a few reasons that the general investor should also consider Occidental Petroleum. Shares currently trade for $60, which is the low target price assigned to its shares by analysts. The consensus view is that shares should move nearer to $68. In addition, Occidental Petroleum includes a dividend which will increase any returns by an additional 88 cents.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07T11:05:00.000Z,EU Slaps Apple with $2B Fine: Strategic Setback or Minor Speed Bump?,"On Monday, Brussels fined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for hindering competition among music streaming rivals through App Store restrictions. The penalty included a basic fine of 40 million euros and a substantial lump sum as a deterrent, marking the EU’s first action and dinging AAPL stock.The European Commission accused Apple in response to a 2019 complaint by Spotify, alleging it prevented the streaming service and others from informing users of alternative payment options outside the App Store.On Monday, Apple faced EU penalties for unfair trading conditions, mirroring a Dutch antitrust ruling. Apple plans to appeal the decision. Currently, AAPL stock is trading substantially lower, with some calling for even more downside on the horizon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith this sort of backdrop, let’s dive into whether Apple is a mega-cap stock worth buying at current levels.The EU competition authority fined Apple nearly $2B for monopolizing music app distribution, leading to a drop in AAPL stock. Following a probe triggered by Spotify, the European Commission penalized Apple €1.8B for breaching antitrust rules with its App Store policies, prohibiting app developers from promoting cheaper alternatives outside the platform.Apple plans to appeal, stating the decision lacks evidence of consumer harm and disregards the competitive market landscape.In Monday trading, AAPL fell over 2% to $174.98. The company also acknowledged how Spotify is the main beneficiary of the released ruling, putting emphasis on its 56% shares in Europe’s music streaming platforms.Spotify reciprocated, stating Apple’s restrictions benefited its own service, Apple Music. Despite the drop, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani maintained a buy rating on Apple stock, adjusting it off his “tactical outperform” list, with a price target of $220.At a press conference, European Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager highlighted that millions of European music streaming users lacked access to all options because of Apple’s anti-steering rules. Spotify welcomed the EU decision but noted broader concerns about Apple’s conduct toward developers in other markets.Analyst Ryan Reith from IDC noted that while the fine wouldn’t immediately impact Apple’s finances, it signals a broader trend of dismantling Apple’s ecosystem barriers. Over the past decade, the EU has fined Google billions, and Vestager’s directive to Apple aligns with the upcoming Digital Markets Act.In other Apple news, the giant tech unveiled its most recent MacBook Air model, powered by its latest M3 chip.

2024-03-07T11:00:38.000Z,"Big changes for Apple, Google and other tech giants: Europe’s sweeping law goes into effect today","Europeans using Apple, Google and other major tech platforms woke to a new reality Thursday as a landmark law imposed tough new competition rules on the companies — changing European Union citizens’ experience with phones, apps, browsers and more.The new EU regulations force sweeping changes on some of the world’s most widely used tech products, including Apple’s app store, Google search and messaging platforms, including Meta’s WhatsApp. And they mark a turning point in a global effort by regulators to bring tech giants to heel after years of allegations that the companies harmed competition and left consumers worse off.The broad obligations apply only to the EU, which could leave tech users in the United States and other markets looking longingly at some of the features Big Tech is rolling out in response to the European directive.In one seismic shift to comply with the law, Apple said it plans to let EU users download iPhone apps via third-party app stores — easing its grip on iOS for the first time since the App Store’s debut 15 years ago.In another significant change, Google said it will alter search results to drive more traffic to independent comparison-shopping or travel-booking sites, instead of directing users toward Google Flights or other tools it owns. Google will also allow Android users to select a preferred browser and search engine from a menu of options when first setting up their devices, rather than defaulting users to Google’s Chrome browser and search engine. That could give a leg up to rival browsers such as Opera or Mozilla’s Firefox and competing search engines including DuckDuckGo or Microsoft’s Bing.Users of messaging apps such as Signal or Viber, meanwhile, could soon be able to send chat messages directly to people who use Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp platforms, under a new openness requirement imposed on the social media giant.And streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix could potentially market discounts within their apps to those that buy subscriptions through the services’ respective websites rather than through proprietary in-app payment systems once forced on app developers by the app stores.The industry-wide changes are linked to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a 2022 law requiring dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. Its broad obligations affect six of the world’s largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.By mid-May, that list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the European Commission said this week.Violations of the DMA can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.For years, policymakers around the world have accused tech giants of monopolizing digital markets and using consumers’ personal data to entrench their power or to identify new markets to dominate. The tech giants, for their part, have insisted they compete vigorously, have created valuable opportunities for entrepreneurs and unlocked billions of dollars in economic activity.Europe’s broad new rules highlight skepticism of that defense and showcase how the EU has led the charge on tech regulation globally, sometimes with ripple effects for the rest of the world.The trading bloc has approved other comprehensive legislation in recent years regulating digital privacy, social media and, soon, artificial intelligence. Some of its regulations have had broader impacts: In 2022, a new EU law forcing Apple to use USB-C as the charging standard for mobile devices prompted Apple to adopt the standard for all its new iPhones, including in the United States.Europe’s new competition law does not directly target the six named companies. Rather, it says that companies meeting a specific size threshold must abide by certain “gatekeeper” rules to prevent them from abusing their enormous economic power.One way the EU plans to regulate that power is by giving consumers more control over how tech giants use their personal information. Under the DMA, EU citizens will be able to opt out of having their usage history from one app shared with other apps owned by the same company. For example, Google users will be able to prevent their search and browsing histories from being shared with Google’s YouTube video platform, which could affect what videos YouTube suggests to users. Amazon, meanwhile, will need consumers’ consent before using their Prime Video, Kindle or Audible usage history to create targeted recommendations or advertisements on its e-commerce marketplace.Europe’s first-of-its-kind digital competition law draws contrasts to the United States, where proposals to regulate the tech industry have repeatedly floundered. Some of the ideas in the DMA have been replicated in US legislation but have failed to pass amid industry opposition and ordinary congressional gridlock.While the law could increase demand for tech companies to extend EU-specific features to other markets, few platforms have shown signs they plan to do so. For example, Apple’s app store plans for Europe diverge significantly from changes to its US-based app store that it was forced to make as part of an antitrust lawsuit involving “Fortnite”-maker Epic Games. Apple has not given any indication it will harmonize the two sets of policies.Consumer groups say the DMA promises to lower prices for Europeans by forcing platforms open and requiring them to compete on a more level playing field.“We have worked really hard at the EU level to get this law adopted to improve digital markets in benefit of consumers,” said Agustin Reyna, legal director at BEUC, a coalition of EU-based consumer advocacy organizations.But some tech companies have pushed back on the DMA, warning that it could lead to unintended consequences.Google, for example, argued this week that its changes to search results in response to the DMA could drive more searches to aggregators of travel or restaurant listings rather than to individual hotels, airlines, restaurants and retailers. It also warned that because of the new requirements around data-sharing, many of Google’s recommendation features “won’t work in the same way anymore,” suggesting life could become less convenient for users who revoke their consent.Meanwhile, Apple has said that requirements to support third-party app stores could expose iOS users to greater amounts of spammy or malicious software, due to Apple’s weakened control over app developers.“The new options we’re introducing to comply with the DMA necessarily mean we will not be able to protect users in the same way,” Apple wrote in a white paper it published last week ahead of Thursday’s compliance deadline. “The changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap” between EU users’ security and the security Apple users enjoy outside the EU, it added.That may have a kernel of truth, but proponents of the DMA have said it can be difficult to determine where legitimate objections to the law end and where self-interest begins.As companies begin to comply with the letter of the DMA, expect some to try to evade its spirit by using consumer scare tactics or “dark patterns,” subtle interface designs intended to nudge users toward sharing more of their data or making other choices a company prefers, Reyna said.“These include misleading language such as ‘use for free’ when consumers pay [for a service] with their data,” BEUC wrote in a report last week. “Data protection options are buried in a maze of settings, and the use of contrast and colours for the ‘accept’ and ‘refuse’ buttons can steer users to the response the gatekeeper wants.”Some companies are already accusing tech giants of flouting the law.On Wednesday, Epic Games published emails showing Apple blocked its request this month to launch a third-party app store on iOS in Europe. In a complaint to EU officials, Epic said Apple justified the decision by referencing Epic’s past deliberate violation of Apple’s app store terms and Epic’s public criticism of Apple.If Apple’s decision is allowed to stand, it will mean tech giants can thwart competition and undermine the law just by pointing to a rival’s past efforts to call out anticompetitive behavior, said Tim Sweeney, Epic Games’ CEO.Past US court rulings have upheld Apple’s right to cut ties with Epic for any reason, Apple said in a statement. “In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”The European Commission has asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA, a Commission spokesperson told CNN Thursday. The EU’s executive body is also evaluating whether Apple’s actions “raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU rules, the spokesperson added.Thursday’s deadline is the final opportunity for gatekeeper companies to submit detailed plans to the European Commission showing how they will comply with the DMA.After reviewing the plans, which could take weeks or months, the commission may choose to launch investigations into companies suspected of noncompliance. Those probes could last for up to one year. Even after the plans are reviewed, the commission could still launch compliance investigations at any time, particularly if it receives complaints from the public.The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group representing four of the six gatekeeper companies — Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta — told CNN that “regulators need to resist the urge to politicize the process” of reviewing the plans.DMA enforcement “should be proportionate and unbiased, taking into account the significant differences between gatekeepers, as well as how these services work in reality,” said Daniel Friedlaender, senior vice president of CCIA and head of its Europe office.Friedlaender warned that the DMA could also frustrate consumers by leading to “product updates they don’t want” or that they could see “changes to their favorite services they really don’t like.”Olesya Dmitracova contributed reporting.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/big-changes-apple-google-other-110038832.html
2024-03-07T10:40:00.000Z,"This 1 Chart Shows How Microsoft Became the Biggest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock and World's Most Valuable Company","Earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company. With a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion, Microsoft is currently worth about $400 billion more than the iPhone manufacturer and stands atop the illustrious list of ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.Following Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) lead, Microsoft began building its own cloud infrastructure business in 2008. In 2010, the company launched its Azure cloud platform. But Azure wasn't really in a state that would allow it to be a credible competitor to Amazon Web Services (AWS) until 2013.Coinciding with the appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO in 2014, Microsoft reorganized and reclassified its business segments. The company also began placing a much bigger emphasis on cloud and subscription-based businesses. While this shift helped drive substantial sales and margin growth for its productivity-and-business-processes segment, the company's intelligent cloud segment and the Azure unit within that segment have been even bigger performance drivers.As the chart shows, intelligent cloud revenue has grown at a rapid pace -- and the segment is now Microsoft's biggest overall sales driver. For the company's 2023 fiscal year (ended June 30, 2023), the segment generated sales of $87.9 billion and accounted for roughly 41.5% of the business's $211.9 billion in total sales. The division also accounted for roughly 43% of the $88.5 billion in operating income that Microsoft posted that fiscal year.Strong performance for the Azure unit and overall intelligent cloud segment has continued in the current fiscal year and helped Microsoft become the world's most valuable company. While AWS remains the overall market leader in cloud infrastructure services, Azure continues to gain market share and it sees strong demand tailwinds in conjunction with the rise of artificial intelligence.Even though Apple continues to generate more revenue than Microsoft, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business helps it have lower costs and achieve superior margins. Thanks to rapid growth and strong profits from the intelligent cloud segment, the software giant tops the list of the world's most valuable companies.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-09T21:14:02.000Z,OpenAI’s success has put a huge target on its back,"OpenAI is the world’s hottest startup. It not only set the stage for the generative AI explosion thanks to the launch of its ChatGPT in November 2022, but it’s also powering Microsoft’s (MSFT) push into the space via a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that gives the tech giant a roughly 49% stake in the company’s for-profit subsidiary.The company is now valued as high as $86 billion, according to Bloomberg. And with its latest product, the generative AI video platform Sora, making waves, CEO Sam Altman and company are riding higher than ever.But OpenAI’s success has also put a massive target on its back. The company is facing a slew of headwinds ranging from lawsuits and government investigations to increasing competition from established players like Google. And some of those could pose an existential threat to OpenAI as it’s currently constituted.OpenAI’s latest trouble comes from a familiar place: co-founder Elon Musk. Last week, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against the generative AI company claiming it is in breach of contract. Musk claims in the suit that OpenAI is in violation of its founding agreement by using its technology to grow its for-profit arm rather than for the benefit of humanity.Musk wants OpenAI to make all of its technologies public and to prevent it from making any money for Microsoft, which uses OpenAI’s models for its various AI Copilot offerings. After helping to found OpenAI in 2015, Musk left the company in 2018 over disagreements about the company’s future and, last year, founded an AI company of his own called x.AI.The New York Times is also suing OpenAI as well as Microsoft, claiming that the companies are benefiting from the use of the Times’ copyrighted material. The Times says OpenAI used its content without permission to train its models, which now benefits the company and Microsoft. The Times wants OpenAI to destroy any content from models trained using its materials.The paper isn’t the only media company looking to take on OpenAI. The Intercept, Raw Story, and AlterNet are also suing the firm, saying it used their data to train its models. The organizations are seeking damages and calling on OpenAI to delete any training data “from which author, title, copyright, and terms of use information was removed.”Removing training data from OpenAI’s large language models could impact their overall performance.OpenAI is also facing regulatory scrutiny in the US and abroad. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the midst of a probe into whether or not OpenAI misled investors. The inquiry followed the OpenAI board’s decision to fire Altman in November, saying he hadn’t been consistently candid with its members. OpenAI rehired Altman less than two weeks after he was removed.The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into OpenAI and its dealings with Microsoft, as well as those of its rivals, as the entity examines the potential impact of major cloud providers investing heavily in generative AI companies. The FTC is looking at Amazon and Google’s investments in OpenAI competitor Anthropic.Overseas, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is seeking comments from the public with regards to whether OpenAI and Microsoft’s deal should be considered a relevant merger situation and what kind of impact that will have on competition in the market.The European Commission, meanwhile, is looking into whether Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship is reviewable under the EU’s Merger Regulation.OpenAI is also staring down increasing competition from some of its biggest rivals. On Monday, Anthropic announced its Claude 3 family of large language models. According to the company, its largest model, Claude 3 Opus, can take on OpenAI’s GPT-4.Google (GOOG, GOOGL) also aims to take on OpenAI with its Gemini family of models. But the company flubbed the rollout of its Gemini image generator and pulled it off the market pending an update.Apple (AAPL) is also looking to get into the generative AI market, with Tim Cook saying that the company is investing heavily in the technology. And while Apple is unlikely to launch an enterprise generative AI model to directly rival OpenAI’s GPT offerings, it could reveal on-device generative AI capabilities that will draw consumers’ attention away from ChatGPT and its ilk.However, OpenAI’s challenges aren’t necessarily signs that the company is in any immediate danger. Lawsuits and regulatory actions can take years to wind their way through the courts if they even get that far. And with Microsoft in its corner, the company has an enormous war chest to pull from to fund its research into larger, more powerful AI models. But with the company sitting at the top of the AI mountain at the moment, it’s sure to face more challenges in the future.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-07T18:04:04.000Z,Apple is making big App Store changes in Europe over new rules. Could it mean more iPhone hacking?,"Apple is opening small cracks in the iPhone's digital fortress as part of a regulatory clampdown in Europe that is striving to give consumers more choices — at the risk of creating new avenues for hackers to steal personal and financial information stored on the devices.The overhaul rolling out Thursday only in the European Union represents the biggest changes to the iPhone's App Store since Apple introduced the concept in 2008. Among other things, people in Europe can download iPhone apps from stores not operated by Apple and are getting alternative ways to pay for in-app transactions.European regulators are hoping the changes mandated by the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, will loosen the control that Big Tech's “digital gatekeepers” have gained over the products and services that consumers and businesses use as they become more dominant forces in everyday life.The measures took effect just days after EU regulators fined Apple nearly $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for thwarting competition in the music streaming market.Apple has lashed out at the new regulations for unnecessary security risks to iPhone users in Europe, exposing them to more scams and other malicious attacks launched from apps downloaded from outside its ecosystems and raising the specter of more unsavory services peddling pornography, illegal drugs and other content that the company has long prohibited in its App Store.Despite trying to maintain security safeguards while also adhering to the new rules in the 27-nation bloc, Apple is warning that “the changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap between the protections that Apple users outside of the EU can rely on and the protections available to users in the EU moving forward.”Apple’s warnings should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say.Managing mobile devices is “totally different” from third-party app stores, and Apple is “deliberately confusing it here to muddy the waters,” said Michael Veale, an associate professor at University College London who specializes in digital rights and regulation.“Apple’s App Store is not a proxy for corporate data security — apps within it regularly send data to insecure cloud servers, to hidden third-party trackers and much more,” he said.Some smaller tech companies like music streaming service Spotify and video game maker Epic Games also are attacking the ways Apple is complying with the DMA as little more than a facade that's making a “mockery” of the regulations' intent.“Rather than creating healthy competition and new choices, Apple’s new terms will erect new barriers and reinforce Apple’s stronghold over the iPhone ecosystem,"" Spotify, Epic and more than two dozen other companies and alliances wrote in a March 1 letter to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm overseeing the DMA.Epic, which makes the popular game Fortnite, also contends Apple is already brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store it planned to release in Sweden. Epic asserted Apple thwarted its attempt to compete as retaliation for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.In response, EU regulators said Thursday that they want to question Apple over allegations it blocked Epic's app store. Apple was defiant, saying it “chose to exercise that right” to boot the app store based on Epic's past behavior.Europe's shifting digital landscape is forcing changes at other technology powerhouses such as Google and Facebook, but the new regulations strike at the core of Apple's philosophy of maintaining ironclad control over every aspect of its products.This “walled garden” approach conceived by late co-founder Steve Jobs begins with the meticulous design of the hardware and then extends into all the software powering it devices, as well as overseeing the commerce occurring on them.The approach built an empire with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue — success that Apple traces to the trust it has built through decades of vigilant management of the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.Even Epic's Sweeney acknowledged that one of the reasons he uses an iPhone is because of the staunch security measures that Apple has deployed to thwart hackers and protect the privacy of its customers. That came during testimony in a May 2021 trial resulting in a U.S. judge ruling that the App Store isn't a monopoly.In that decision, the judge required Apple to begin allowing links to outside payment options inside iPhone apps in the U.S. It's a requirement that the company began to allow earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on that issue.Apple — which is making changes in Europe through an iPhone software update — still doesn't permit alternative iPhone app stores in the U.S. or more than 100 other countries outside the EU.European regulators appear convinced that the benefits consumers stand to reap from more competition will outweigh any increased security risks.One potential positive is lower prices for digital transactions within apps if competing stores charge lower commissions than the 15% to 30% fees Apple has been imposing for years.But critics are raising doubts that will happen because Apple still plans to charge fees after app downloads reach relatively low thresholds and have set up other hurdles that will make it daunting for alternative options to make significant inroads in Europe.Apple insists the security problems hatched by the DMA are so worrisome that it has been hearing from government agencies — especially those in defense, banking and emergency services — wanting to ensure they will be able to block employees with iPhones from accessing apps distributed from outside Apple's walled garden.“These agencies have all recognized that sideloading — downloading apps from outside the App Store — could compromise security and put government data and devices at risk,” Apple said.Veale, the digital expert, pushed back.“Any firm or government who believe ‘apps from the App Store are safe’ may need to refresh their security and data protection teams or policies,” he said.___AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed from London.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-making-big-app-store-095017332.html

It cited Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.Epic Games had sought to take advantage of landmark EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which kick in on Thursday and require Apple to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.Breton criticised Apple's decision.""Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority,"" he said on X social media platform.The European Commission had earlier on Thursday said it had asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA.The EU executive will also evaluate whether Apple's actions comply with the DSA (Digital Services Act) and the P2B (Platform to Business Regulation), ""given the links between the developer programme membership and the App store as designated VLOP (very large online platform)"".Under the DSA, decisions suspending or terminating accounts have to be proportionate and with due regard to fundamental rights while the P2B requires a platform to notify a business user when terms and conditions are changed and before an account is closed.Apple reiterated its rights on Thursday.""Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion',"" an Apple spokesperson said.""In light of Epic's past and ongoing behaviour, Apple chose to exercise that right.""Epic on Wednesday said Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

2024-03-07T13:53:59.000Z,"As Big Tech scrambles to meet EU rules, investigations seen as likely","By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) -The world's biggest tech companies have overhauled their core platform services to comply with EU rules forcing them to play fairer with rivals but will likely face investigations ahead amid criticism their efforts may have fallen short.The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called ""Big Tech"" - Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance - and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth.Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.If any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.The European Commission's reaction to the compliance efforts could take several months as they review the changes and build up a watertight case able to withstand a legal challenge.Apple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.Yet its introduction of new fees such as a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.Vestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.Rivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough. The Commission declined to comment.With eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet's Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.The company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking.com and Expedia, which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.That has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries. Google declined to comment.Meta, which said Instagram and Facebook users will be asked if their data can be shared between its services, could also run the risk of an investigation. Meta declined to comment.Microsoft, Amazon and ByteDance may face less scrutiny initially as EU regulators focus their resources on one or two cases and ensure a case able to withstand a legal challenge, people familiar with the matter said.Amazon said it had engaged constructively with the EU regulator on the DMA.""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment,"" a spokesperson said.Microsoft and ByteDance declined to comment.Pressure for an EU investigation is also coming from the some of the big six companies themselves.At least one has told the European Commission that it was not fair to have to play by the DMA rules while a rival flouts them, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.Unlike EU antitrust investigations which can take years to wrap, DMA enforcers have just a year to issue their findings.($1 = 0.9173 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith, Jamie Freed and David Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/big-tech-scrambles-meet-eu-060317676.html
2024-03-06T22:27:12.000Z,Epic Games: Apple terminated our developer account,"Epic Games, the company behind the popular ""Fortnite"" video game, says Apple (AAPL) has terminated its developer account, with Epic calling it a ""serious violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act."" It's the latest volley in the battle between the two companies.Watch the video above to hear Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley explain the feud.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Apple dealing a blow to Epic Games. The video game software company saying Apple terminated its developer account preventing the development of the Epic Games Store for iOS. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Josh. This all comes down to what's known as the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. Basically, it establishes that there are certain key players in the technology space. And because of their size, they have to allow for certain capabilities for other companies.And so for Apple being a key player, they essentially have to allow third party apps to build third party app stores. They no longer have to rely on Apple's App Store as the sole place to download apps. Now Apple and Epic have had a tumultuous relationship, to say the least. Apple pulled the game ""Fortnite"" and Epic's ability to develop games for iOS after Epic in a kind of showdown with the company over pricing for apps sold through its App Store went ahead and changed prices on its own and allowed a third party means of purchasing apps through the App Store.All of this is to say they don't like each other. And now Epic is claiming that because of comments that CEO Tim Sweeney made regarding Apple's upcoming changes to the App Store in Europe, that is supposed to abide by that Digital Markets Act, the Apple has gone ahead and pulled the ability for Epic to actually go ahead and build its own third party app store and put games on iPhones.And so this is a larger problem that Apple will have to potentially deal with when it comes to the European Union and European Commission as far as antitrust goes. It's clear that Epic is not going to stand by. It's clear that Apple is not going to abide by Epic kind of I guess rankling them. And so now we're going to have to see what happens when the two come to blows.JULIE HYMAN: And what does this mean for Epic in the long run?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, Epic hasn't been allowed to sell ""Fortnite"" on iOS for a while. They were going to be able to do this again, in Europe at least, not in the US, nowhere else, but in Europe in particular. And so it means that there's a loss of potential revenue here that could impact them over the long term.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/epic-games-apple-terminated-developer-222712373.html
2024-03-06T21:45:05.000Z,Magnificent Seven's AI plays are losing investor interest,"Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) are all experiencing declines, highlighting the challenges faced by these tech titans in the current market environment. Tesla and Apple are grappling with slowing demand in the crucial Chinese market, a development that has raised concerns about their growth prospects in one of the world's largest economies.On the other hand, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is facing challenges related to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence. While AI has sparked the interest of investors, Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills joins the Live Show to break down why AI alone is not enough to sustain investor engagement.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: Both Apple and Tesla ending the day lower after several sessions of declines. Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills here with her takeaways for the day. And this kind of speaks to what I was just saying is that we're starting to see some of these divergences.MADISON MILLS: We're seeing the divergences, and we're getting a lot of fun pithy names from the street. Josh and I were talking about this, the three AI amigos you mentioned.JOSH LIPTON: That was Gene Munster.MADISON MILLS: Steve Sosnick today telling me it's the Fantastic Four, which I find interesting. My take, which people would pay millions of dollars for, of course, is that there are three winners, one survivor, and three losers here. So you have Apple, Tesla really struggling year to date.And I want to talk about their exposure to China, because that's one of the primary drivers to the challenges that they're having. With Tesla, we've got weak deliveries in China. Apple's local iPhone sales are struggling. And then you have Alphabet, which announced an AI-driven image search functionality earlier this year that they had to take off the market in under 24 hours because of challenges with that AI.That leads me to my second point here, the AI and mentions of AI are not enough. You actually have to be able to use it, imagine that. It has to work in order for the market to be happy about it. And there's really no better case for that than Nvidia, which, by the way, as Jared was mentioning, that sea of green over there, Nvidia has maintained that sea of green this week, even when we've seen some sell-offs. So continuing to see Nvidia lifting up the broader market here.In terms of what's next, it seems like these AI plays that can win on not only the use case, but also the fundamentals, keeping those sales up in spite of any, you know, decreased sales out of regions like China, that is going to be the key for this rally moving forward.JOSH LIPTON: It was interesting to talk about that AI thing, we just spoke to Doug Clinton over Deepwater. And his firm's a shareholder, but clearly expressing some real frustration there. Yeah--JULIE HYMAN: With Alphabet you mean?JOSH LIPTON: With Alphabet, yeah.MADISON MILLS: It doesn't work. And so if you introduce something to the market that doesn't work yet, you can't really be surprised when people aren't happy about that, I would imagine. But then I'm also-- I'm interested in Microsoft. Obviously, they're up on the year. So I think we have a chart showing the Magnificent Seven names compared year-to-date.They were the clear winner of AI because of OpenAI, of course, but really trailing the likes of Nvidia, of course, in the Magnificent Seven trade year-to-date. And I'm curious about whether they're going to be able to have a catalyst for more growth moving forward on AI or if that's just priced into the name at this point.JULIE HYMAN: Well, it's also interesting as we talk about now that some of them are lagging. And yet up until a couple of days ago, the market was continuing to make new highs, which sort of lends credence to the idea, as some strategists we've been talking have been saying, that there is a broadening that's been happening.Nancy Tengler, I think, called it a quiet broadening, right?MADISON MILLS: Stealth broadening, stealth, yes.JULIE HYMAN: Stealth broadening in the market that's been happening. So the idea for so long that the market could not go up unless all of these guys were going up, that now seems to be going away a little bit.MADISON MILLS: Yeah. We had this UBS note saying, rain or shine, whether you've got the Fed raising rates higher for longer, cutting rates, or whether you have all of the Magnificent Seven performing well, to your point, Julie, it seems like this market is going to go up regardless. As long as Nvidia is there, we're good.JULIE HYMAN: Stocks go up.MADISON MILLS: Stocks go up. Yes, exactly.JOSH LIPTON: Madison, thank you so much. Appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/magnificent-sevens-ai-plays-losing-214505243.html

2024-03-06T21:20:29.000Z,Apple stock extends declines for sixth day,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) are experiencing a prolonged sell-off, marking the sixth consecutive day of declines for the tech giant. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre delves into the details surrounding Apple's recent downturn, offering insights into the oversold state and what it could mean for investors.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Apple shares on track for their sixth straight decline. The stock now off 10% from its most recent high. Jared Blikre is here with a look at the next levels traders are watching. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Thank you, Josh. It's getting ugly out there. We can see behind me, this is a year to date chart in Apple. And we just fell out of bed because 180 was a support level to watch there. And we have now traded under it for about three straight days.Now I'm going to go to a three-year chart so I can show you some of the levels that are of interest below the current price. So 165 is really where I think the rubber meets the road right here. So 169, pretty close to that. Then you have the 150 area. I also include maybe 145.But then the real biggest support that I'm seeing is around 120 to 125, and that is way down there. Now that would be an extreme move, and it probably wouldn't happen overnight. And it doesn't have to happen over all. But one of the interesting things that's happened over the last few days is the market has come down so fast, Apple stock has come down so fast, it is oversold. And in fact, there's something called the relative strength indicator, it is now printing a 22 out of 100.Now anything under a 30 is considered oversold. And when this happens, a lot of times there's a mean reversion. So I ran the statistics, and here's what it's looking like for when we get a drop below the RSi below 25 and then it pop back above. Going back 25 years, it's happened 12 times. But the statistics are really bad over the next few days. Negative or over the next two days, the next one week, the next two weeks, and one month. You have to go out to a quarter.So it might not be the best time to be buying Apple right now. And I'll just close with an Apple seasonality, this is average returns per month. And you can see through May, generally pretty positive here. So we do have that slight tailwind of positive seasonality. But could be some more pain in terms of-- excuse me-- more pain potentially in the short term here, guys.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-stock-extends-declines-sixth-212029115.html

2024-03-06T20:13:31.000Z,ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,"ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman's firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.What does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.While there is a more…nefarious side to ChatGPT, it’s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it. Prior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (a super-charged version of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model) and a multimodal API. OpenAI also unveiled the GPT store, where users could create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT. Though the launch was delayed in December, it officially launched in January.GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft’s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT. Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.March 2024February 2024January 2024December 2023November 2023 October 2023September 2023August 2023July 2023June 2023May 2023April 2023March 2023February 2023January 2023December 2022November 2022ChatGPT FAQsOpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps.

The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure “well above” reasonable demands.ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was giving nonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning.The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAI in an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match’s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024.As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new “memory” controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won’t erase ChatGPT’s or a custom GPT’s memories — you must delete the memory itself.We’re testing ChatGPT's ability to remember things you discuss to make future chats more helpful.This feature is being rolled out to a small portion of Free and Plus users, and it's easy to turn on or off. https://t.co/1Tv355oa7V pic.twitter.com/BsFinBSTbs— OpenAI (@OpenAI) February 13, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsInitially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate.

An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report.OpenAI has been told it’s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy’s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven’t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: “We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.”In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it’s partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy. After a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI’s board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company’s top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent. In a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5’s API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce “laziness” that users have experienced.Expanding the platform for @OpenAIDevs: new generation of embedding models, updated GPT-4 Turbo, and lower pricing on GPT-3.5 Turbo. https://t.co/7wzCLwB1ax— OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 25, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsOpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep.

It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution.After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences “verbatim.” Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be ""fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support."" Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow.In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.”Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.Snapshot of how we’re preparing for 2024’s worldwide elections:• Working to prevent abuse, including misleading deepfakes• Providing transparency on AI-generated content• Improving access to authoritative voting informationhttps://t.co/qsysYy5l0L— OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 15, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsIn an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of “military and warfare.” In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to “harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.”Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community.To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans — ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.the GPT store is live!https://t.co/AKg1mjlvo2fun speculation last night about which GPTs will be doing the best by the end of today.— Sam Altman (@sama) January 10, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsFollowing a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the UK, OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee.

In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.Starting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels “lazier” than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren’t sure why it’s happening.Some users think it plays into the “winter break hypothesis,” which argues that AI is worse in December because it “learned” to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.we've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it 🫡— ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsThe U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties.

Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Rosário admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.According to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI’s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.After launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT’s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.OpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a “low-key research preview” evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: “what a year it’s been…”a year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning’s launch.what a year it’s been…— Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT’s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta’s Threads.A test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI’s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word “poem” forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.According to a new report by SlashNext, there’s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.Following speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa’s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.Now that OpenAI’s ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses — like a much smarter version of Siri.Altman's return came swiftly, with an ""agreement in principle"" announced between him and OpenAI's board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.Even if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the ""headphones"" icon.The only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.“Obviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they’re not going to be in OpenAI,” Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was ""open"" to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.A number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company's board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT's future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.Sam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company’s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board “no longer has confidence in [Altman’s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.”In a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI “was transformative” for him and “hopefully the world.”OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.Following OpenAI’s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus’ new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.An independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety. OpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that’s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.As opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says — largely due to technical hurdles.Users and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI’s marketplace and monetize it in the future.After being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.DALL-E 3, OpenAI’s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI’s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.Bowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don’t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.OpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.At its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build “agent-like experiences” within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.OpenAI’s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it’s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like “Chat & Ask AI” and “ChatOn — AI Chat Bot Assistant”, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.Subscribers to ChatGPT’s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.OpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.The integration means users don’t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.A Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the “trustworthiness” — and toxicity — of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of “jailbreaking” prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.OpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures — dropping from 30% to 20% in September.OpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB— OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsOpenAI announced that it's adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.The Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT — accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot — receiving the results directly within the chat app.Powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.The new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system’s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.ChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds ""enterprise-grade"" privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.Recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn’t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company's API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model’s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the “feel” of the model’s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.Fine-tuning costs:Training: $0.008 / 1K tokensUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokensUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokensIn OpenAI's first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.“We’re very excited for the impact they’ll have here at OpenAI,” OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. “The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.”OpenAI announced that it's expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple's China App Store ahead of the country's latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.“As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),” Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. “Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.”A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.ChatGPT is available to ""pre-order"" for Android users.The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version’s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too — so if you’re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don’t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.The company said this feature lets you “share anything you’d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.” For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI's flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ""false, misleading, disparaging or harmful"" statements about people.TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ""with a history of successful payments"" can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.OpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.The Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting “GPT-4” in the model switcher and choosing “Browse with Bing” from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.U.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car’s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car “Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.”It's not really clear what for, though.The new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.On iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet’s interface.The Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that “no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,” or if it was, that it was checked “by a human being.”The list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.OpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.The ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries — Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon!— OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices — meaning it will know what you’ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices.“In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.”VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.Called ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as “for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.”“ChatGPT Business will follow our API’s data usage policies, which means that end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.”OpenAI applied for a trademark for “GPT,” which stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the “myriad infringements and counterfeit apps” beginning to spring into existence.Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI’s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide “appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.”That means a decision could take up to five more months.Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI's latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ""autonomously"" perform tasks.Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself.FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud in a congressional hearing.“AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated.The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat’s AI features.Italy’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data.The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get the regulator's compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4.YC Demo Day's Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ""ChatGPT for X."" They’re all chasing after a customer service software market that’ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:Yuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.Baselit, which uses one of OpenAI's text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.Lasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they'd like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.BerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.The letter's signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.”The letter reads:Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot's functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it’ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.GPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.ChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft’s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be “Microsoft managed customers and partners,” can apply here for special access.OpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.At a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.Other companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord -- putting the pressure on Big Tech’s AI initiatives, like Google.After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for ""ChatGPT Professional"" as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.OpenAI said that it's ""starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT"" in an announcement on the company's official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no ""blackout"" windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT — “at least 2x the regular daily limit.”A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers -- Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston -- made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI’s answers with the world.GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that’s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.Most recently, Microsoft announced at it's 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.Much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.ChatGPT's generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been ""learning"" for a longer period of time than Bard.A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.Yes.Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is ""coming soon.""It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder -- if not impossible -- to run today.The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind’s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ""legitimate interest"" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/06/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/chatgpt-everything-know-ai-powered-210339686.html

2024-03-06T18:28:23.000Z,Magnificent 7 Price Targets: What Each of These Stocks Could Be Worth in 2030,"The Magnificent 7 stocks have captivated investors over the past few months with their meteoric rise. These heavyweight tech names have propelled much of the market’s gains in recent years. But not all of the Magnificent 7 have delivered equally magnificent returns. While titans like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue charging ahead, stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have lagged.Yet, even amidst their mixed trajectories, it’s worth taking a step back to consider where each of these influential stocks could be headed over the long-run. As they scale to new heights, momentum seems to be driving share prices more than fundamentals. That’s often a sign of overvaluation. Many believe a meaningful correction could hit some of these names in the coming months or weeks.That said, I remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for these innovative companies. By 2030, they could each reach entirely new levels if they maintain dominance in their core markets. But how high could each stock realistically climb? Let’s take a look!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers, and for good reason. This stalwart has not fully embraced the AI and data boom powering much of the recent gains in this group. With iPhone sales plateauing, Apple looks like a company stuck in the past to many investors. Losing its crown as the largest company to Microsoft only added insult to injury.However, underneath the surface, Apple has quietly built a foundation for future growth. Its new Vision Pro VR headset, despite a hefty $3,499 starting price, has sold over 200,000 units as of the end of January, exceeding expectations. VR and AR remain early-stage markets, so the demand for this product has limits for now. But Apple is laying the groundwork in a potentially massive arena.Meanwhile, Apple recently bested Q4 expectations, proving reports of its demise were premature. Critics argue the company is still too slow in pursuing AI. However, with Apple snapping up AI startups and making key hires, bears may soon be proven wrong. This sleeping giant could rejoin the party in the coming years. If Apple capitalizes on its strengths in hardware and combines it with AI expertise, the stock could eclipse $500 by 2030.Source: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains a top Magnificent 7 buy. Yes, its premium valuation of 43-times earnings and 3-times sales raises eyebrows. But the company’s growth prospects justify these multiples. Analysts forecast Amazon’s earnings per share will triple from 2024 to 2033 amid double-digit revenue growth. I believe Amazon could even exceed these projections.Several factors drive this potential. AWS maintains strong demand as cloud adoption rises. Additionally, Amazon’s AI investments are starting to bear fruit across its divisions. The company is firing on all cylinders – even making healthcare inroads via Amazon Pharmacy and the OneMedical acquisition. E-commerce leadership provides a wide moat. Developing in-house chips will also result in massive cost declines for the company’s chip needs in its AWS segment.This is a business executing on all fronts. AI permeates every segment, from e-commerce to pharma. Amazon simply has too many levers to pull in too many growing markets to be stopped. I see AMZN stock reaching $750 or more by 2030, depending on how far into the future markets are willing to extrapolate this growth story.Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has lagged behind its peers in capitalizing on AI, but it is catching up fast. Concerns have emerged as ChatGPT seemed poised to disrupt the company’s core Google search business. But neither ChatGPT nor Bing made a dent in Google’s supremacy. Meanwhile, Alphabet has kept its head down developing its own powerful AI.Upgrading Bard with Gemini showcased Alphabet’s progress. Then came Gemma and Gemini Ultra, which the company claims is the most advanced model yet – even surpassing GPT-4. The validity of this claim is uncertain. But clearly, Alphabet has closed the AI gap. Google Cloud growth also underscores its momentum, with Q4 revenue up 26% to $9.2 billion.Alphabet appears well-positioned for the AI age after weathering the ChatGPT threat. Google search retains its dominance, as the company expands into new technologies. With the company firing on all cylinders again, I see substantial upside ahead. If the company maintains momentum in cloud and AI, GOOG stock could fetch more than $400 per share by 2030. For a stock that’s lagged its peers, the future looks increasingly bright for Alphabet moving forward.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comI’ve long been bullish on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) despite the stock market’s harsh treatment of the stock in 2022. Shares plunged below $100 as Meta invested heavily in its future vision. I pounded the table on META stock from $120 down to $90 before its sharp rebound.Meta’s bets on AR and VR seem premature today. These technologies remain in their early stages of development, with limited near-term returns. But Meta’s core apps – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – are cash cows. Yes, teenagers shun Facebook. However, social media networks are still seeing overall user growth. And notably, Instagram and WhatsApp have young demographics locked down.As I wrote in October, Meta’s valuation looked fair based on 2023 estimates. Had Meta paid dividends over investing in the metaverse, it may have appealed more to long-term shareholders. Lo and behold, Meta recently initiated a dividend – making it more attractive to additional investor types.My 2025 target of $400 proved conservative as shares hit $500 in early March. But I now believe $850 per share is achievable by 2030. That’s a modest projection, given Meta likely cools off after this breakout over fair value.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft has rocketed higher since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. Its AI investments via OpenAI sparked today’s hype. Indeed, Microsoft 365 remains essential for office productivity. By combining its software suite with AI, Microsoft is enabling more and more efficiency.Its data center business is booming as well. Microsoft’s AI investments across its business units are paying dividends. This stalwart should stay vital for the foreseeable future, delivering further upside. A $1,200 target by 2030 seems reasonable given Microsoft’s expansive reach, as the company makes big bets in emerging fields like quantum computing.Microsoft has its hands in every facet of tech. The company has defined past eras of computing and appears positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation too.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comI’m bearish on Nvidia in the near-term. Semiconductors are cyclical, but investors get carried away and became downright euphoric during the recent AI-fueled rally. We saw huge gains this past year that I expect to reverse, much like the 2000 dot-com bubble.Several headwinds face Nvidia investors. Many tech giants are developing their own AI chips rather than buying from Nvidia. With these firms also backing AI startups, Nvidia’s dominance in this space may wane. Moreover, rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are rolling out powerful new AI chips. It’s only a matter of time before they catch up.Nvidia remains a momentum stock today. I believe long-term holders can still profit, but likely after weathering steep losses first. Even with these headwinds, $1,300 per share by 2030 seems achievable for NVDA stock.Source: franz12 / Shutterstock.comTesla has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers recently. But don’t count this EV giant out over the long-term. The culprit driving this recent decline has been rising rates and tight money weighing on the EV sector. Once rates drop, Tesla and its peers should see growth reaccelerate.Consider Tesla’s massive runway. Only 1% of vehicles are electric today. Tesla has no serious U.S. competitors. And while overseas rivals are gaining steam, they’re unlikely to ever dominate the U.S. market, with most such foreign competitors focusing on hybrids anyway. As the U.S. moves to electrify its fleet in the coming decades, Tesla remains the EV giant to beat.Tesla also leads in batteries, charging infrastructure, and technology. It has carved an enviable niche that should propel growth once macro conditions improve.The stock may tread water until rates decline. But with most of the company’s future growth still ahead, Tesla charging toward a $600+ level by 2030 seems reasonable.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-06T17:28:39.000Z,SEC adopts landmark climate rule — here's what that means for public companies,"For the first time, US public companies will be required to tell investors about their exposure to climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions.On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved requiring US-listed companies to communicate how they are managing material risks related to climate change and how those risks affect their bottom lines. Large companies will also be required to disclose their direct emissions from their operations and energy use, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.""I think it's important for the US to have its own standards based on US law, based on the economics of our markets, based upon what investors here are using to make investment decisions, and I think today's action is that important step for our US capital markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said during the meeting. ""These roles will enhance the disclosures that investors have been relying on to make their investment decisions. Issuers and investors will benefit from the consistency, comparability, reliability of these disclosures.""The measure passed 3-2 along political lines following two years of review and over 24,000 comments on the proposal.The SEC notably pared back the final ruling, trimming a provision that would have required companies to report their Scope 3 impact — that is, indirect emissions from suppliers and consumers.The Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.SEC's exclusion of Scope 3 data is considered a win for many businesses given that indirect emissions make up the largest and fastest-growing category of emissions.Scope 3 categories include emissions from purchased goods, employee commutes, projects financed, and the use of products sold, among others. In the oil and gas sector, Scope 3 emissions can account for up to 95% of emissions; in financial services companies, the figure is even higher at up to 99%.Nevertheless, the landmark ruling by Wall Street's top regulator sets mandatory requirements — detailed in the SEC press release — that provide greater consistency, comparability, and reliability in climate data so that investors and consumers can make more informed decisions.""I think what's kind of most important is that the information begins to flow,"" Bryan McGannon, managing director at US SIF (the Sustainable Investment Forum), told Yahoo Finance. ""So even if it doesn't include Scope 3 information, investors are going to get, for the first time, companies reporting their climate risk.""Josh Griffin, co-founder and chief policy officer at NZero, a climate data platform, told Yahoo Finance that companies are ""seeing that their customers want a better understanding, and it’s showing up in market choices. Companies that not only invest in technologies to reduce their emissions but [also] are transparent about their efforts are being rewarded by their customers. This is where these regulatory requirements from the SEC are so vital because they create consistency and shared expectations.""The landmark rule will affect thousands of companies, many of which already provide this information publicly on a voluntary basis or to comply with other regulations.Companies will now face four main types of disclosure requirements when they register with the SEC and in their annual reports: what their climate risks are, how they are adapting to those risks, how the board of directors is overseeing climate strategy, and how climate targets will affect the business.Large non-exempt companies will also have to list their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Many already track that information: As of 2022, nearly all S&P 500 companies and 90% of Russell 1000 companies published sustainability reports, according to the Governance & Accountability Institute.""There are fairly well-established methods for being able to build out Scope 1 [data],"" Rob Fisher, the US ESG Leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""Scope 2, frequently, it's not overly complicated. There are many aggregation services ... that are able to get your Scope 2 emissions.""The SEC expects large corporations such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Exxon (XOM) to begin reporting their climate risk-related information in their fiscal year 2025 and to report their greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal year 2026. They will also need to submit a limited third-party review of their emissions data by 2029 and a full audit by 2033.Smaller companies and emerging growth companies will have an additional two years to disclose their climate risks and will not be required to report their emissions, which provides space for new technological developments to evolve.""The climate rule [that] got issued in March 2022 was basically before the rise of generative AI,"" KPMG's Fisher noted. ""And now, you know, things have kind of gone crazy. … So, I think the intersection of AI and this new reporting requirement is quite interesting because we can do some things very differently now in how we address the rule this time around than we could last time.""Fisher noted that for ""most organizations, building out a Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas inventory is certainly not trivial, depending on the scope and size of the operation. But certainly ... the big thing is that the data generally resides inside the virtual four walls of the organization.""How prepared they actually are to meet these requirements is not entirely clear. A KPMG survey found that 4 out of 5 companies say they are ahead of their peers when it comes to sustainability reporting, yet nearly half still lean on spreadsheets to manage data instead of advanced data systems.""The tools are more readily available and more seamless for companies to gather their Scope 1 and 2 emissions,"" nZero's Griffin said. ""Scope 3 still presents a lot of challenges because of jurisdictional issues, but the market for collecting such data has also grown quite a bit in the last two years.""The SEC's rule marks a step up in climate disclosure requirements, and it's been a long time coming.Since 1971, the SEC has recommended that companies communicate the cost of complying with environmental regulations. In 2010, the agency went further to suggest that companies should voluntarily provide details about their exposure to climate risks, if material.Increasing extreme weather events, scrutiny around inflated sustainability claims, and pressure from activists, investors, and governments only heightened the pressure for mandatory disclosures.By 2021, the SEC began seeking feedback on the shape of climate disclosure policy. When it released its draft proposal in March 2022, it drew polarized responses from groups on both sides of the aisle that only intensified as ESG investing became a political lightning rod.And while the rule has been finalized, the issue is far from settled. Lawsuits against the SEC are virtually guaranteed, experts say, something Gensler has been preparing for.Although the removal of the Scope 3 rule may lessen the risk of litigation from the US Chamber of Commerce, American Farm Bureau Federation, and National Association of Manufacturers, it could provoke the opposite reaction from green groups.""I think what has taken them long to come to the final rule was to make sure that what was in the final rule is as durable as possible to withstand litigation challenge,"" US SIF's McGannon said. ""I think they went to really great lengths to ensure that the rule would stand.""Companies have also been closely watching whether the SEC's rule would align with disclosure requirements that have gained traction around the world or else join what Fisher called a ""patchwork quilt"" of regulations that collectively raise compliance costs.One benchmark is the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which took effect on Jan. 5, 2023. The EU law has a broader definition of materiality that includes human and environmental impacts as well as financial impacts. The EU also mandates reporting of Scope 3 emissions, which the SEC stopped short of.The United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong have also set climate reporting standards. And earlier this year, China hinted at joining them.Then there's California's climate disclosure law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in October 2023, which made the state the first in the US to approve such a measure. It also set the stage for legislators in New York and Illinois to follow suit with their own climate disclosure bills.California's two climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, go much further by requiring disclosures from both private and public companies that do business in the state. Those with revenues over $500 million must publish their climate risk plans, and those with over $1 billion in revenue are required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.The effect is that many large multinationals or companies with operations in California will be required to report Scope 3 emissions even if the SEC is not requiring them to do so.""Scope 3 may be out of the SEC’s climate rule but it’s very much in scope for US multinationals and likely many private companies,"" Fisher wrote in an email following the decision. ""The SEC’s rule followed actions of the EU, California, and the ISSB, all of which require Scope 3 reporting. Regulatory relief in one jurisdiction does not alter the burden imposed in others.""Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/sec-adopts-landmark-climate-rule--heres-what-that-means-for-public-companies-172839134.html

2024-03-06T22:01:07.000Z,UPDATE 5-Apple escalates Epic Games feud by blocking Fortnite app in EU,"(Rewrites throughout with background about Epic's dispute with Apple)By Akash Sriram and Stephen NellisMarch 6 (Reuters) - Apple escalated its feud with Epic Games on Wednesday, blocking the Fortnite video-game maker from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe.The two companies have been in a legal battle since 2020, when the gaming firm alleged that Apple's practice of charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iPhone Operating System (iOS) devices violated U.S. antitrust rules.The latest challenge from Epic comes as Apple struggles with concerns abouttepid demandfor its iPhones in China, and its stock has tumbled 12% so far this year, underperforming its big tech peers in the U.S. Its shares were largely unchanged on Wednesday.Attempts by regulators and competitors such as Epic to pave the way for rival marketplaces on Apple's devices are a major threat to the Silicon Valley heavyweight's profits and control of its own ecosystem.European lawmakers are forcing Apple to allow those third-party marketplaces with a law called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that takes effect this week.Separately,Brussels antitrust regulatorson Monday fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, Apple's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules.Epic was working to take advantage of the DMA, but Apple blocked those efforts on Wednesday, citing Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. Epic had created the account in an effort to put Fornite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. Apple must allow third-party stores on its devices, under the new European law.The developer accounts are important because software creators cannot distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without one. Apple had previously terminated some of Epic's developer accounts in 2020, after Epic purposely broke Apple's in-app payment rules, using its violation of the rules and subsequent banishment from the App Store as the core of public relations and legal campaign against Apple.Apple said on Wednesday the court rulings have made clear that it has ""sole discretion"" to terminate any Epic Games developer account in light of its ""egregious"" breaches of the company's developer agreements.""In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right"" to terminate Epic Games' account, Apple said.Epic alleged that by terminating its account, Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.""This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,"" Epic Games said.The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple in January proposed certain changes ahead of a March 7 deadline to comply with certain conditions of the DMA, a legislation meant to make it easier for European users to move between competing services.The company said it would allow alternative app stores on iPhones and an opt-out from using the in-app payments system, but set a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year for developers who sign up for the new regime.

Apple shares have been pressured by concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union.The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday, its sixth straight negative session. The 7.2% decline over that six-day drop has erased more than $200 billion in market capitalization.“At some point this hate is going to be too much, and most oversold in six years seems like a good place to start,” Michael Toomey, head of TMT trading at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a note to clients.He said the length of the stock’s underperformance relative to the Nasdaq 100 has been notable, adding that “feels like every day we get another negative AAPL datapoint, and it’s not particularly cheap.”Jefferies looked at the relative strength index of long Apple positions versus short positions in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. Based on this, “this is the most oversold AAPL/QQQ has been since early 2018.”Bespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a post on X that Apple is more than three standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, and that “it hasn’t been this oversold since March 16th, 2020 in the throes of the COVID crash.”Even with the stock’s recent weakness, Apple shares trade near 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average multiple of 19.Despite the selloff, options traders are showing few signs of fear, buoyed by the broader optimism about the biggest technology stocks.Implied volatility for three-month options has picked up from recent lows, but is around the middle of the range for the past year.

Jared, what are you seeing?JARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm seeing a marked difference from yesterday. You can see tech express through the NASDAQ, and also the Russell 2000, small caps, both up 1%, clawing back some of those big losses we had yesterday.As you were saying earlier, earlier in the year, January 2 was the last time we had a tech sell-off in XLK of that strength. But then, look what's number one today, XLK up 1% followed by E for energy, then materials, communication, services, and real estate. All of those outperforming. In fact, as you can see, everything in the green here.And just kind of continuing on Mady's theme of the bifurcation that we see in the Mag Seven, and just in general in big tech, there is Apple. Really stands out. It's trading to the downside, not by a lot. But just check out this one-year chart. I've been tracking this support level here at about $165. And we are heading down to that level, just about $5 away.And on a three-year basis, you can see, if we break this level probably heading to what-- $150, $125-- something in there. So this does have repercussions. Apple is still a very important bellwether stock for the market.Do want to mention bonds here quickly, because we have the 10-year T-note yield hovering near one-month lows. You'd have to go back to February to see what's happening there. In terms of the price level, that's 4.12% for that rate. It's down one basis point there. We've been seeing rates go down. And it's unusual in that the NASDAQ usually does the opposite of what rates do, but we've seen kind of the opposite with that recently.All right, just with a few seconds to go, I want to check out what's happening with crypto. Give you a quick pick-- there we go. Quick peek at the Bitcoin price, $67,178.

2024-03-06T13:13:36.000Z,Trade of the Day: Profit Off Recent Weakness in Apple (AAPL) Stock,"If there was one company that grabbed business headlines the most on Tuesday, it would have to be consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). According to a CNBC report, AAPL stock dragged the broader tech space down. An unflattering report urged investors to approach the stock carefully, sending shares down 3%.Counterpoint Research stated yesterday that Apple iPhone sales in China dropped a staggering 24% in the first six weeks of 2024. The company faces increasing competition from local smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo.That presents massive questions for longer-term viability. After all, AAPL stock has long thrived on its brand and pricing power. Consumers are willing to pay extra for the privilege of owning Apple products – and thus becoming integrated with its ecosystem. Lose that advantage and AAPL could sharply correct over the next several months as investors digest this new reality.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere’s our game plan: We don’t care.If you’ve ever watched a professional baseball game, you know that players don’t swing at every pitch. Instead, they analyze the pitch count and many other factors that could influence the next pitch thrown. In some sense, baseball players are data analysts, waiting for the right moment to swing the bat.That’s a similar situation to what we have with AAPL stock here. Because shares suffered a steep drop yesterday, there’s a good chance that Apple could open today’s session in the red.Notably, since the beginning of October 2023, whenever the opening price of a session was lower than the prior day’s closing price, there is a 55.4% chance that the price of the current session will end higher. Further, when the opener is positive, there’s a 54.9% chance that the current session will likewise end higher.Chart by Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace.com In other words, AAPL stock has an upward bias in its near-term pricing dynamics. And when the opening price is negative, the bulls are just that extra bit motivated to push shares northward.We’re going to use this math to our advantage.Armed with Apple’s pitch count, we’re going to swing the bat if AAPL stock opens below Tuesday’s closing price of $170.12. Statistically, this should give us the best odds of AAPL moving higher.To make this trade work, we need leverage, and that’s where Apple’s call options come into play. In particular, I’m looking at the slightly out-of-money (OTM) 8 March 2024 $172.50 call. On Tuesday, this contract closed with a premium of 95 cents. Using Barchart’s options calculator, if AAPL stock rises to $171 (a little more than a 0.5% move), the contract value could theoretically jump to $1.26.Please be aware that no matter what happens, you need to enter this trade today and exit today. Due to the derivative market’s time decay, you can’t afford to spend quality time with this option.

2024-03-06T12:56:07.000Z,Fed Chair Powell is about to get grilled by Congress. Here’s what markets want to hear,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Uncertainty around the economy and the Federal Reserve’s next moves has cast a shadow over Wall Street this month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a chance to provide more insight when he testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.Markets have whipsawed between new highs and precipitous drops as contrasting economic data cause confusion about what the Fed will do next.That market seesaw could continue this week as Powell’s semi-annual congressional testimony provides investors with a rare opportunity to hear the Fed head’s views on a range of topics from inflation to regional bank health.Here’s what investors will be listening for, and reacting to, over the next two days.Inflation expectations: Powell’s messaging on Fed policy over the past few months has been fairly consistent — he’s made it clear that he’s in no rush to cut interest rates.“Basically, we want to see more good data. It’s not that the data aren’t good enough. It’s that there’s really six months of data. We just want to see more good data along those lines,” he said on 60 Minutes last month.But that statement came before a month of not so good data — price rises accelerated in January from the previous month and wholesale inflation saw its biggest monthly increase since August.Those reports pushed back market bets on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. The majority of investors are now expecting an interest rate cut at the Fed’s June policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Just one month ago they thought it would be in May.Investors will closely listen for any hints from Powell about what the Fed is looking for, data-wise, before it begins to lower interest rates.Economic outlook: Even as inflation surprised to the upside last month, the economy held up better than expected.After more than 20 months of inflation above the Fed’s 2% target and higher borrowing costs, investors, economists and — eventually — Federal Reserve officials said they expected the economy to soften this year, allowing the central bank to finally start cutting rates.But economists at S&P 500 Global Ratings now expect US real gross domestic product to grow by 2.4% in 2024, up from their forecast of 1.5% in November. The labor market remains incredibly resilient, with unemployment at historic lows and wage inflation elevated.Investors will look to Powell to comment on how long he thinks the economy can perform well while interest rates are high.Powell will also be asked about the economic pain Americans are feeling as a result of elevated inflation and interest rates.Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, told Politico that he’s thinking of asking Powell why “the American public does not feel as if the economy is anywhere close to the level that I know it to be based on my everyday involvement with this committee.”Americans have been struggling with higher prices, especially for essentials like rent, groceries and gas. Food prices rose 0.4% between December and January, the highest monthly rate in a year. Mortgage rates have climbed for four weeks in a row.Regional banks: “We’ll be listening for any commentary from Powell on the soundness of regional banks in light of their commercial real estate exposure,” said Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar.New York Community Bank announced that it had taken large hits in its commercial real estate exposure earlier this year, and shares of the bank have tumbled to their lowest level since 1996 after the beleaguered regional lender said in a filing last week it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls.The news sent the bank’s bonds tumbling as well as investors worrying about more disruption to the regional banking sector.The stock was further pressured Friday after Fitch Ratings downgraded NYCB’s debt to junk status and Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating further into junk territory.What could happen: Don’t expect Powell to be too forthcoming.As former Fed economist Claudia Sahm said it in her latest newsletter, “It would be un-Fed-like to tell us how many more months of good data it needs to be confident [of cutting rates].”Powell is expected to emphasize the need for more patience. Federal Reserve officials, including Powell, have repeatedly said they envision at most three rate cuts in 2024 and indicated that they’re in no rush to get there.Goldbugs are rejoicing as their favorite precious metal continues to reach new heights, reports my colleague and Before the Bell co-writer Krystal Hur.The price of gold rose on Tuesday to settle at $2,141.90 a troy ounce, notching another record high as investors continue to bet the Federal Reserve will cut rates in the back half of the year.Gold is considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metal. However, some investors also believe gold to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that it will hold its value even if it begins to surge.It’s not just traders trying to get in on the gold rush. Costco started selling gold bars last September and sold more than $100 million during its fiscal first quarter of 2024. The precious metal tends to be popular during times of global economic unease, since it’s a tangible asset and less risky than stocks.iPhone sales in China dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report, adding to significant problems for Apple and other Western tech companies in a crucial market, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly.Analysts from Counterpoint Research said the overall mobile market in China fell by 7% with companies including Apple, Oppo and Vivo experiencing declines.But the problem for Apple has been ongoing for a year as China’s economy slows down and trade tensions and nationalism heat up. Customers that once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands, particularly Huawei, Counterpoint said.“Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,” Mengmeng Zhang, a Counterpoint senior analyst, said in a press release. “Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now.”Apple shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 11.6% this year on concerns about weakening sales, particularly in China.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/fed-chair-powell-grilled-congress-125607997.html
2024-03-06T11:59:00.000Z,META Stock Analysis: 3 Reasons to Buy Meta Platforms Now,"What a tear Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been on this year. Indeed, the tech giant remains a top choice for tech investors, given its robust AI presence. In 2024, META stock delivered four quarters of impressive results, including its first dividend and $40.1 billion in sales, surpassing estimates.CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s commitment to AI is evident through Meta’s Artemis AI chip development and recent board additions like Broadcom’s Hock E. Tan and John Arnold.Meta Platforms’ stock has surged 180% over the past 12 months, and trading near its all-time high, right around $500 per share at the time of writing. Investor confidence has returned as advertising rebounded, fueled by expanded buyback and dividend initiatives. Despite a trillion-dollar market cap, Meta lags behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose iOS updates affected ad sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the tough competition, META stock is still a hard-to-beat competitor. Here are three reasons why I think META stock is still a buy, even at these elevated levels.In the fourth quarter, profit surged by 203%, exceeding previous increases of 31% and 168%. Sales growth also accelerated from 11% to 23% and 25%. Daily active Facebook users reached 2.11 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. Additionally, operating margins rose to 41% from 20% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Analysts anticipate 52% earnings growth in 2024 and 10% in 2025. Institutional buying surged, reflected in a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Meta’s robust performance in 2023 likely bolstered management’s confidence in initiating a dividend. Free cash flow surged to nearly $44 billion, while cash and marketable securities reached $65.4 billion, surpassing its $18.4 billion debt. Revenue growth accelerated, with a 25% increase in the fourth quarter, contrasting with a 4% decline a year ago.Total 2023 revenue rose 16% while operating costs increased by just 1%, showcasing impressive operating leverage. This disciplined approach fueled substantial cash generation, positioning Meta as a prime candidate for dividend payouts alongside stock repurchases, a strategy already underway by management.Meta’s financial analysis suggests it could have initiated dividends earlier. Despite a 50% decline in free cash flow in 2022, it remained at $19 billion. Shareholders benefited indirectly through $31.5 billion in stock buybacks, showcasing Meta’s commitment to returning capital. However, it had yet to introduce dividends.Post-rebranding, Meta Platforms has become a pioneer in AI integration in the metaverse, boosting immersive experiences with features like voice commands and custom AI chips.Based on projections, Meta likely won’t surpass Apple’s valuation over any time frame, but it holds more significant potential for growth at least in the near-term. Indeed, META stock would need to double to match Apple’s market cap, with many pointing to AI as the reason for such a move. However, despite Apple’s low single-digit earnings growth and high valuation, it’s also true that Meta looks relatively expensive compared to its top- and bottom-line growth numbers right now.Still, plenty of attention will remain on the Meta Quest headset as a value alternative to Apple’s Vision Pro. Partnering with LG Electronics, Meta aims to bolster its XR business, enhancing its virtual and augmented reality position. With ventures into AI-driven advertising, social media, and the metaverse, Meta remains poised for substantial growth, justifying its 32.6 price-earnings multiple.Meta stock broke out from a three-week tight pattern, hitting a high of more than $500 per share. This move has been driven by strong demand for retail and institutional investors, inviting analysts to revise theri price targets higher.The IBD Leaderboard stock hit a record high on Feb. 23, with a 38% gain year-to-date. Approaching $500, META stock has soared since late October, riding its 10-week moving average with muscular relative strength. Additionally, BofA Securities raised Meta Platforms’ price target to $425 from $405, citing potential growth drivers like digital advertising and reel performance. These analysts currently maintain a buy rating on the stock.I’ve been pounding the table on META stock for years, even as the stock was declining during the previous bear market. Much of that has to do with the company’s core cash cow of a business, and its ability to remain flexible in investing in the businesses of the future. I think Meta has the right management team for the job, and remains a stock worth owning here.Yes, Meta is much more expensive than it’s been in some time. But it’s my view that investors looking for a growth stock to hold for the next decade or longer really can’t go wrong with this name right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-06T11:46:47.000Z,Apple tweaks changes to comply with EU tech rules after criticism,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple has modified some of its proposals to comply with landmark EU tech rules after criticism from app developers, including dropping a demand that those who want to create alternative app marketplaces must have a stand-by letter of credit.The company and five other tech giants have to comply by March 7 with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which sets a out a list of dos and don'ts aimed at reining in their power and creating a level playing field for rivals and more choices for users.Apple had in January announced proposals which allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple's own App Store, as well as new fees and conditions.The iPhone maker said one change will now allow developers to sign up to the new terms announced two months ago at the developer account level.""We've removed the corporate entity requirement that the Addendum must be signed by each membership that controls, is controlled by, or is under control with another membership,"" Apple said on its website late Tuesday.It also created a one-time option for developers to terminate the Addendum under certain circumstances and switch back to Apple's standard business terms for their EU apps.Lastly, it scrapped a demand for a letter of credit from developers who want to create a rival app marketplace and introduced two eligibility criteria.""A developer may operate an alternative app marketplace if their account has been in existence for two years and they have an established app business in the EU with more than 1 million First Annual Installs,"" Apple said.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-tweaks-changes-comply-eu-114647455.html
2024-03-06T09:30:00.000Z,"Apple's China sales plunge by a quarter in first 6 weeks as resurgent Huawei steals the show, according to Counterpoint","Apple's iPhone sales in China fell by nearly a quarter in the first six weeks of 2024 year on year, in the latest sign that the US smartphone giant is losing more ground in the country to a resurgent Huawei Technologies, according to data from Counterpoint Research.Overall smartphone sales fell 7 per cent year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, with Chinese brands Oppo and Vivo experiencing sales declines of 29 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, according to Counterpoint.Apple's iPhone sales fell 24 per cent over the period, giving it 15.7 per cent of the Chinese market and ranking the US firm fourth after Vivo, Huawei, and Honor. Counterpoint said ""fierce competition"" and an ""unusually high sales base in January 2023"" were the main reasons behind the decline in iPhone sales.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Huawei was the biggest winner in the period, with the Shenzhen-based giant achieving a 64 per cent jump in sales, giving it 16.5 per cent of the market. Honor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, saw a 2 per cent increase in sales, giving it 16.3 per cent of the China market.Counterpoint said Huawei benefited from strong demand for its flagship 5G-capable Mate 60 series, launched late last year with a powerful home-grown chip, the Kirin 9000S. Chinese netizens have hailed the smartphone as symbolic of China's ability to defy tough US sanctions.Some analysts say Apple has been slow to adopt generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools into its devices compared with domestic brands, as competition intensifies in the high-end market segment.Chinese smartphone makers such as Honor and Xiaomi showcased their generative AI prowess at industry event MWC Barcelona 2024 in late February.Xiaomi, which has 13.8 per cent of the Chinese handset market, recently launched its flagship photography-focused smartphone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, into the luxury segment with prices starting from 6,499 yuan (US$903).Honor showcased its Magic6 Pro with AI features at MWC Barcelona 2024. The Magic Portal function uses AI to understand user behaviour and streamline tasks, such as direction requests in map apps.Apple-authorised retailers on the mainland have started offering steep discounts on the latest iPhone 15 series, in an effort to revive sales.In promotional events on Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall and rival JD.com, the top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max, launched last September, can be bought for 8,849 yuan (US$1,230), roughly 1,150 yuan cheaper than the official list price.

2024-03-07T08:54:35.000Z,Europe's Digital Markets Act is forcing tech giants to make changes. Here's what that will look like,"LONDON (AP) — Europeans scrolling their phones and computers this week will get new choices for default browsers and search engines, where to download iPhone apps and how their personal online data is used.They're part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act, a set of European Union regulations that six tech companies classed as “gatekeepers” — Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — will have to start following by midnight Wednesday.The DMA is the latest in a series of regulations that Europe has passed as a global leader in reining in the dominance of large tech companies. Tech giants have responded — sometimes reluctantly — by changing some of their long-held ways of doing business, such as Apple allowing people to install smartphone apps outside of its App Store.The new rules have broad but vague goals of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable."" They are kicking in as efforts around the world to crack down on the tech industry are picking up pace.Here's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:WHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES?Some 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media platforms, will be in the DMA's crosshairs.They include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and Android operating system, plus Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari Browser and iOS.Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's Windows and LinkedIn.The companies face the threat of hefty fines worth up to 20% of their annual global revenue for repeated violations — which could amount to billions of dollars — or even a breakup of their businesses for “systematic infringements.”WHAT EFFECT WILL THE RULES HAVE GLOBALLY?The Digital Markets Act is a fresh milestone for the 27-nation European Union in its longstanding role as a worldwide trendsetter in clamping down on the tech industry.The bloc has previously hit Google with whopping fines in antitrust cases, rolled out tough rules to clean up social media and is bringing in world-first artificial intelligence regulations.Now, places like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and India are drawing up their own versions of DMA-like rules aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.""We’re seeing copycats around the world already,"" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. The DMA “will become the defacto standard” for digital regulation in the democratic world, he said.Officials will be looking to Brussels for guidance, said Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London.“If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA to avoid fragmentation and the risk of taking a different approach that fails,” he said.HOW WILL DOWNLOADING APPS CHANGE?In one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes installed on its mobile devices.The company has long resisted such a move, with a big chunk of its revenue coming from the 30% fee it charges for payments — such as for Disney+ subscriptions — made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that “sideloading” apps will come with added security risks.Now, Apple is cutting those fees it collects from app developers in Europe that opt to stay within the company’s payment-processing system. But it's adding a 50-euro cent fee for each iOS app installed through third-party app stores, which critics say will deter the many existing free apps — whose developers currently don't pay any fee — from jumping ship.“Why would they possibly opt into a world where they have to pay a 50 cent per-user fee?” said Avery Gardiner, Spotify's global director of competition policy. “So those alternative app stores will never get traction, because they’ll be missing this huge chunk of apps that would need to be there in order for customers to find the store attractive.""“That is utterly at odds with the very purpose of the DMA,” Gardiner added.Brussels will be closely scrutinizing whether tech companies are complying.EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said this week that after 10 years on the job, “I have seen quite a number of antitrust cases and quite a lot of creativity built into how to work around the rules that we have.""HOW WILL PEOPLE GET MORE OPTIONS ONLINE?Consumers won't be forced into default choices for key services.Android users can pick which search engine to use by default, while iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their go-to. Europeans will see choice screens on their devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.The idea is to stop people from being nudged into using Apple’s Safari browser or Google’s Search app. But smaller players still worry that they might end up worse off than before.Users might just stick with what they recognize because they don't know anything about the other options, said Christian Kroll, CEO of Berlin-based search engine Ecosia.Ecosia has been pushing for Apple and Google to include more information about rival services in the choice screens.“If people don’t know what the alternatives are, it’s rather unlikely that many of them will select an alternative,” Kroll said. “I’m a big fan of the DMA. I am not sure yet if it will have the results that we’re hoping for.”HOW WILL INTERNET SEARCHES CHANGE?Some Google search results will show up differently, because the DMA bans companies from giving preference to their own services.So, for example, searches for hotels will now display an extra ""carousel"" of booking sites like Expedia. Meanwhile, the Google Flights button on the search result display will be removed and the site will be listed among the blue links on search result pages.Users also will have options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising based on their online activity.Google users are getting the choice to stop data from being shared across the company’s services to help better target them with ads.Meta is allowing users to separate their Facebook and Instagram accounts so their personal information can't be combined for ad targeting.The DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other. Meta, which owns the only two chat apps that fall under the rules, is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can exchange text messages, videos and images.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/europes-digital-markets-act-forcing-051231799.html
2024-03-05T23:21:36.000Z,"Apple revises its DMA rules after pressure, but keeps the Core Technology Fee intact","No, Apple's new and controversial ""Core Technology Fee"" isn't going away for EU app developers who opt into the iPhone maker's new business terms designed to comply with the region's Digital Markets Act. However, today Apple is announcing a handful of smaller concessions driven by feedback from its app developer community, it says. Notably, the company will now no longer require that corporate entities must sign up for the new DMA terms along with all their sub-accounts, nor will it require a standby letter of credit. In addition, the move to opt into the DMA terms is no longer a one-way switch. Instead, developers under certain circumstances will have the option for a one-time switch back to the existing terms -- meaning the standard 15% to 30% commission, not the reduced one under the new rules.However, these changes don't address the major complaints with Apple's DMA rules, which involve reducing commissions on App Store purchases in favor of other new fees. At issue is Apple's institution of a new ""Core Technology Fee,"" which requires developers to pay Apple €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold for apps distributed outside its App Store.Larger developers like Spotify and Epic Games have lashed out at Apple's plans to ""comply"" with the DMA, calling its plan ""extortion” and “bad-faith” compliance, among other things. Other tech companies, including Meta, Mozilla, and Microsoft have also criticized Apple's DMA rules, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the requirements were ""so onerous"" he didn't see how any developer would be able to adopt them. A consortium of developers, led by Epic and Spotify, also penned an open letter to the European Commission, asking the government to assess Apple's compliance and take “swift, timely, and decisive action"" against the tech company to protect developers.Apple didn't make any move to adjust its fee structure with these new changes. Rather, it's adjusting some of the more obviously less compliant terms -- like the rule that said that marketplace app developers would need a €1,000,000 letter of credit from an A-rated financial institution to receive the DMA entitlement. That would prevent individual and smaller developers from signing up, which would mean Apple wasn't fully in line with the law.The other change will allow a larger corporate entity to pick and choose which of its developer accounts opt into the DMA rules, and which do not at the developer account level. Before, Apple was requiring that corporations sign up each membership it controls if it chose to opt into the DMA rules. That also doesn't make sense, as various arms of a larger corporation should be able to make their own business decisions and act accordingly.Apple may have known in advance that these sorts of rules wouldn't fly and chose to pull them back ahead of a directive to do so as a gesture of compliance and ""listening"" to its community.Another change sounds like it would make it easier for developers to test the DMA rules and then switch back, but that's not necessarily the case.Instead, Apple says developers can terminate the DMA Addendum one time without terminating their Developer Agreement -- but only if ""you have never had an Application be an Alternative App Marketplace (EU), be distributed through an Alternative App Marketplace (EU), use Linking Out, or use Alternative Payment Processing.""In other words, if the developer never actually began to do business under the new terms.Signing the agreement doesn't give developers the ability to terminate their agreement a second time if they have already done so, the company says. Plus, Apple says it will still invoice the developer terminating its agreement for the Core Technology Fee, which has to be paid within 30 days. They can then choose to opt back into the DMA rules at a later date, if desired.Apple announced these changes to its DMA rules alongside the launch of Xcode 15.3 and the latest SDKs for iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, tvOS 17.4, visionOS 1.1, and watchOS 10.4. Developers can now begin to submit apps under the DMA terms, Apple says, and can now measure the number of first annual installs their apps have accumulated.The company additionally updated its App Review Guidelines to include references to the new DMA rules, including that app developers cannot copy the names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative marketplaces. It also says that alternative app marketplaces cannot compile personal information on users unless they specifically consent, nor can they use public databases to collect that personal information. It also says apps that don't comply with its guidelines will be blocked from installation -- including via alternative app marketplaces.Spotify, Epic Games and others pen letter to EC, claiming Apple has made a ‘mockery’ of the DMAThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/apple-revises-its-dma-rules-after-pressure-but-keeps-the-core-technology-fee-intact/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-revises-dma-rules-pressure-201204552.html
2024-03-05T22:15:28.000Z,Tech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks came under pressure as a trio of tech heavyweights fell, with traders wading through mixed economic data in the run-up to Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackStocks Kick Off Key Inflation Week Under Pressure: Markets WrapThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, DirectorEquities lost traction after a rally that has spurred concern about sky-high valuations — especially in megacaps, leaving the group vulnerable to big moves in the face of bad news. Apple Inc.’s iPhone woes in China deepened while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US roadblock in selling an artificial-intelligence chip to the Asian nation. And Tesla Inc. extended its rout as China shipments slumped.Bullish positioning in US technology stocks is at the highest in three years — raising the risk of a pullback, according to Citigroup Inc.’s Chris Montagu. Long positioning in Nasdaq 100 futures is “extremely extended,” he said.“Trees don’t grow to the sky,” said Kenny Polcari at SlateStone Wealth. “What is starting to concern some investors is whether or not some of these tech companies that have gotten stretched can in fact live up to the ‘lofty valuations’ that investors have placed on them.”Wall Street also weighed data showing the US service sector cooled — even as orders and business activity picked up. Caution prevailed, with Powell heading to Capitol Hill for his semiannual testimony before Congress, where the Federal Reserve chief is expected to reiterate the lack of urgency to cut rates.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, while the Nasdaq 100 slipped almost twice as much. Tesla extended a two-day selloff to 11%, while Apple suffered its fifth straight loss. Nvidia Corp. rose. Treasury 10-year yields fell six basis points to 4.15%. Bitcoin slid after a record-setting run that topped $69,000. Gold also hit an all-time high.Never miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.The “Magnificent Seven” — comprising Apple, Microsoft Corp., Nvidia, Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla — have powered the S&P 500 to all-time peaks this year, partly fueled by the AI frenzy.The rally has left strategists scrambling to lift their 2024 targets — while raising questions on whether tech is seeing a boom or a bubble.To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic, the dramatic rally in US equities and Bitcoin signals accumulating froth — conditions that typically precede a bubble when asset prices rise at an unsustainable pace. Meanwhile, David Kostin at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among those who argue big tech’s lofty valuations are supported by fundamentals.The so-called Magnificent Seven saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group helped drive the Nasdaq 100 to its fourth consecutive monthly gain.“The AI craze is a modern gold rush, and the tech ‘picks and shovels companies’ are seeing earnings explode as companies buy chips and cloud space to fuel the boom,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. “But if AI doesn’t result in increased profitability for the rest of the S&P 500 over the coming years, then demand for AI chips will evaporate as will AI-related cloud demand.”With generative AI set to be the growth theme of the decade, UBS’s Chief Investment Office continues to believe that US tech stocks should make up a substantial portion of investors’ equity allocations. However, the firm says investors with excessive exposure should consider broadening tech exposure to capture the next growth opportunities.“While we see further room for the current tech rally to run, we think investors should review and optimize their exposure to technology to protect against potential declines and benefit from opportunities beyond big tech,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.“Although we see pockets of speculation and the tech sector could be due for a breather, we don’t see a bubble,” said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. “Valuations are rich on most metrics, but with tech, comparative earnings momentum tends to be a more important near-term driver. And profit trends remain strong and are at new highs.”The three-year outperformance of the tech sector to the S&P 500 is just above 30%, Lerner said. This is roughly in line with the 30-year average and far from the peak of just above 250% seen in March 2000, he added.“Comparisons to the dot-com bubble should be expected given the concentration of gains in the tech sector and proliferation of excitement around a new technology,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird. “But from 1996 to 1999, the average three-year trailing return was 96%. We are not yet close to those levels. There’s room to run.”Valuations, earnings trends and market sentiment all refute speculation that an AI-driven tech bubble has reemerged in US large caps, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“Our theme universe of AI stocks shows sales generally supporting price gains, with multiples in the middle of their five-year range,” they wrote. “Unless fundamental shortfalls emerge, high-market-cap concentration for mega-cap tech and strong returns for AI may not present material risk to the S&P 500.”The largest five companies in the S&P 500 trade at less than half the multiples of the “Four Horsemen” — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell Technologies Inc. — in March 2000, which surpassed 80 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis, according to BI.Additionally, valuations appear to be relatively contained across accelerating technology themes — such as AI, future of finance, cloud and robotics — with most baskets trading at or beneath five-year average price-to-sales multiples, they said.“While we stand by our argument that US stocks are not in a bubble, the confluence of a prospective Fed easing cycle and an attention-grabbing new technology does raise the risk that one might form later this year and into 2025,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “The easiest way to sidestep this problem would be for the Fed to delay rate cuts as long as possible.”While stock prices are not part of the Fed’s official mandate, Colas says he’s wondering whether Powell will try to dampen the market’s recent enthusiasm by delivering a more hawkish than expected message this week.“The AI frenzy combined with expectations for rate cuts in 2024 renewed ‘bubbly’ investor behavior,” according to the GMO Asset Allocation team. “If the projected Fed cuts fail to occur or growth companies fail to deliver on aggressive expectations, growth investors will likely wind up disappointed.”Corporate Highlights:CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. gave a forecast for revenue and profit in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling strong customer demand for the company’s expanding suite of cybersecurity offerings.Nordstrom Inc. is forecasting muted revenue and comparable sales growth this year as sluggish demand at its high-end namesake stores offsets an improving outlook at its off-price Rack stores.Target Corp.’s fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, as the retailer continued its improvements in inventory management and said its decline in traffic slowed.Walt Disney Co.

This follows news from yesterday of a $2 billion EU antitrust fine, shares of Apple sliding to their lowest level in roughly four months. Joining us now to talk all things Apple Ben Bajarin, creative strategies and CEO and principal analyst. Ben, it is always good to have you on the show.So let's start on that headline today, Ben. So listen, the stock's down today again. And it looks like it's on this headline from counterpoint research saying iPhone sales they plunged. According to their research, 24% in the first six weeks of the year. Rival Huawei, Huawei they say going the other way unit sales actually surged more than 60%. How worried, Ben-- if you're reading this, you're an Apple investor, how worried are you-- how concerned are you about that headline?BEN BAJALIN: Yeah. I mean, not terribly concerned, I think most investors we talk to take the long view in iPhone sales. I think the quarter over quarter fluctuations, people understand that there's still broad softness in China, especially at the high end. I think if you look at some of the sales that's happening there from local brands, even some of the surge from Huawei is not entirely in the high end. And I think most people who look at some of the underlying data and know that in China, Apple's retention rates-- so loyalty and intent to buy iPhones going forward remains the highest of any brand.And I think we're just continuing to see some of this delay in the high end refresh that we've been watching for the last few quarters in China. And on top of that, I think it's becoming again abundantly clear that the refresh rates in China, especially in the high end are elongating and that's really impacting everyone. But to this point again with Huawei, it doesn't look like they are taking share from Apple, they're again-- they're recovering from a very small base after the sanctions that were hit on them.So like I said, I think everybody is holding the long view. And within that view, it seems like things will normalize and be relatively stable on par in terms of expectations in China for the year.JOSH LIPTO: I'm just interested to push on that point though, Ben, China is such a critical market for Tim Cook. But when they last reported December quarter, China sales down 13% year over year. So I guess, when do you see that changing then? Is that near intermediate term?BEN BAJALIN: Yeah. I think there's been optimism that we're starting to see some of that recovery probably from March into the middle of the year. And then obviously it goes soft again right on the heels of new iPhone launches. There's obviously a whole lot of discussion around how much anticipation is there for the next iPhone. I think there's been a huge debate around, will consumers-- iPhone consumers in China wait, even push their upgrade cycle even longer toward the end of the year hoping that some GenAI stuff comes for Apple in the next platform launch.So I think there's a little bit of that, I mean, obviously, to your point, which is correct. I think there's been the criticism that the iPhone was just not as big of a year-over-year upgrade enough to really move a cycle. I think, again, I keep coming back to this. This doesn't mean that sales are gone, it's just that sales are delayed. And so I do think we're seeing some optimism that that's refreshing now. But obviously I do think there'll be a big spotlight on the fall as Apple integrates AI and what that next iPhone could be in terms of satisfying more of that pent up demand that we feel is in China.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/why-optimism-apple-must-delayed-214852585.html

How do I handle this gracefully?On Tuesday, all three major indexes suffered their largest daily point and percentage decline since Feb. 13, while booking back-to-back losses after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back Monday from record finishes scored at the end of last week , according to Dow Jones Market Data.Tuesday’s trading session saw investors taking a cautious tone, with megacap tech stocks tumbling, dragging the market further from record highs reached over the past few weeks. So far, the year has been good for U.S. stocks as investors have navigated moderating inflation, consistent economic growth and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.However, until investors see a fresh round of economic data and speeches on these topics later this week, it’s still a risk-off mood in the financial market — at least for equities. Bitcoin BTCUSD notched a new record high on Tuesday morning, briefly moving past $69,000 , before plummeting to trade above $63,000 a coin Tuesday afternoon.There’s good reason for the scrutiny, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “This is an important week for a market that has been pricing in a host, a series, of rate cuts,” she told MarketWatch via phone on Tuesday.Investors will brace for remarks from Fed Chair Powell — who is expected to deliver monetary-policy updates to the House of Representatives on Wednesday and to the Senate on Thursday — while listening hard for clues on the pace, timing and extent of any interest-rate cuts for the rest of 2024, she said.Until then, Krosby said she saw the selloff on Tuesday as a “healthy” consolidation, because investors “need to digest the gains” from last few weeks.Greg W. Halter, director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel, also said the pullback was natural, adding that some investors may seize the chance to take profits and shift into the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 that are trading at lower valuations.“The market is broadening out, but the question of debate is can the market [continue to] go higher if you don’t have Microsoft MSFT, Apple and Nvidia NVDA being the leaders,” Halter said in a phone interview with MarketWatch.In U.S. economic data on Tuesday, the ISM service-sector PMI fell to 52.6% in February from 53.4% in January, marking a bigger-than-expected drop . Still, a number over 50% signals economic expansion, where the index has been since December 2022.Factory orders also fell 3.6%  in January, dragged down by fewer contracts for passenger airplanes from Boeing.Tuesday also saw pressure from a dip in Apple Inc.’s AAPL shares weighing on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.

2024-03-05T21:30:42.000Z,Apple iPhones sales fall 24% in China amid competition and headwinds,"iPhone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report, adding to significant problems for Apple and other Western tech companies in a crucial market.Analysts from Counterpoint Research said the overall mobile market in China fell by 7% with companies including Apple, Oppo and Vivo experiencing declines.But the problem for Apple has been ongoing for a year as China’s economy slows down, and trade tensions and nationalism heat up. Customers that once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands, particularly Huawei, Counterpoint said.“Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi,” Mengmeng Zhang, a Counterpoint senior analyst, said in a press release. “Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now.”Apple shares slid 2.8% on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 11.6% this year on concerns about weakening sales, particularly in China.The company did not respond to a request for comment.The report comes amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, higher unemployment of younger workers and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.China remains a very important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Apple previously made a lot of gains during its launch period last year. The company continues to offer discounts to help ameliorate some of the downturn.Last year, Huawei’s Mate 60 made headlines when the US government sought more information about the Pro model which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.Now, some Chinese consumers think they’ve been wronged by the US government sanctions and are gravitating toward Huawei’s Mate 60 smartphone, which is edging into Apple volumes.Jeff Fieldhack, a research director with Counterpoint, told CNN part of the issue is that Apple had a strong January last year due to part shortages, but didn’t experience shortages in January this year.“This isn’t a major deal for Apple in the long term,” he said. “It is still a successful iPhone launch and there is more discounting and marketing they can do this year in China to help alleviate the competition from Huawei.”Huawei in January represented 17% of the mobile market share in China, compared to Apple’s 16% share. Huawei demand is higher than its supply, which means it could in theory be selling more, Fieldhack added.“Apple, to its credit, ended the year at number one, which was extraordinary despite headwinds from China,” he said.CNN’s Krystal Hur contributed to this reportFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphones-sales-fall-24-213042555.html
2024-03-05T21:28:25.000Z,"US STOCKS-Tech-heavy Nasdaq leads Wall Street lower as megacaps, chips slide","*US services sector cools in February, ISM survey shows*Target forecasts FY comparable sales above estimates*Apple drops after China iPhone sales plunge*Indexes down: Dow 1.04%, S&P 1.02%, Nasdaq 1.65%(Updates with final prices after market close)By Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur KamdarMarch 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street three major indexes all retreated more than 1% on Tuesday, with weakness in megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc and the chip sector weighing most on the Nasdaq ahead of this week's crop of economic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Tuesday's economic data was a mixed bag showing slower U.S. services industry growth in February as employment declined while a measure of new orders grew to a six-month high, signaling underlying strength in the sector.The Purchasing Managers Index report on Tuesday confirmed continued economic growth despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Fed since March 2022.Another survey showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped more than expected in January.Some strategists saw the technology sell-off on Tuesday as the result of profit taking for a sector which had recently rallied after rising 56% in 2023.""Maybe some people are taking chips off the table, taking some profits in the high flying areas, in conjunction with what is probably justified nerves before Powell speaks and before we get the big slew of labor market data,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Two reports helped to create a risk-off tone, said Craig Fehr, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones in St. Louis.Apple shares finished down 2.8% after a research report showed iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 as Apple faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.Also the chip sector was battered after Bloomberg News reported that Advanced Micro Devices hit a roadblock in its efforts to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market as Washington cracks down on advanced technology exports to Beijing.Chip rivals fell in sympathy with the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which closed down 2%.Fehr also attributed some of Tuesday's weakness to recent rallies. The benchmark S&P 500 had hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower.""It's reasonable and even healthy to take some pit stops along the way. This market is, to a degree, stopping for a breather after what's been a very sharp run higher,"" he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 404.64 points, or 1.04%, to 38,585.19. The S&P 500 lost 52.3 points, or 1.02%, at 5,078.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 267.92 points, or 1.65%, to 15,939.59.Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 industry indexes declined, with technology ending down 1.2% and consumer discretionary falling 1.3%. Energy, up 0.7%, was the biggest gainer followed by consumer staples, which rose 0.3%.Along with Powell's testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday, investors are also anxiously awaiting more clues about interest rate policy from economic data, including the crucial non-farm payrolls report, due out on Friday.The majority of traders see the first rate cut this year in June, as per CME Group's FedWatch tool.Among megacap technology stocks, Tesla shares sank 3.9% after its European Gigafactory near Berlin halted production following a suspected arson attack.On the bright side, Target shares rallied 12% after the retailer forecast annual comparable sales largely above estimates, betting on same-day services, product launches and a new membership program to boost spending.Microstrategy shares tumbled 21% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 113 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 13.22 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.99 billion average for the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard Chang)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/us-stocks-tech-heavy-nasdaq-212825396.html
2024-03-05T20:50:03.000Z,Apple Shares Are Tanking. Here Are Levels Traders Are Watching,"(Bloomberg) — Traders are eyeing Apple Inc. after its stock slid below a critical psychological threshold on Tuesday as shares entered a technical correction for the first time since August this month.Most Read from BloombergApple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales PlungeTech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets WrapGold Climbs to Record as Momentum Builds on Bets Over Fed PivotOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised.America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop.The shares, which failed to hold the $180 support level last week, traded for less than $170 at various points during Tuesday’s session. Breaking through that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities.“Apple is one of the most influential stocks so it may see a bounce from here in the short-run after being oversold,” Sohn said over the phone. “But traders may still look to fade it at $180 because its trend has deteriorated so much.”Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company have shed nearly 12% this year after closing at a record in December, erasing more than $300 billion in market value. That’s cost Apple its crown as the most valuable US company to Microsoft Corp., as some of its Big Tech peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. keep rallying.Apple is facing a slew of issues, including regulatory scrutiny of its App Store, declining sales in China and investor concerns over its growth prospects. Its fourth-quarter outlook also raised worries due to tepid demand for its handsets and other gadgets.Naturally, short sellers are pouncing. Apple was the the stock market’s second-most profitable short position in February at $606 million in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.Read more: Apple Shorts Eye Key $180 Level With CautionWith Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that technology shares broadly may face pressure in the coming months, even with Nvidia’s dominance. The iPhone maker continues to set new lows relative to the $252 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.That said, Birinyi Associates found that Apple’s correlation to the S&P 500 isn’t as tight as some may think. On a scale where 1 means a perfect directional relationship and 0 indicates no relationship at all, Apple clocks in at 0.65 compared with 0.69 for Nvidia and 0.36 for the average S&P stock, according to Jeff Rubin, director of research at Birinyi.From a technical perspective, this means the US stock market can continue to churn higher as long as Apple’s stock doesn’t break its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.“While this isn’t an intermediate-term concern, and there’s ample evidence that ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks can certainly carry markets higher without the aid of Apple,” Newton wrote in a note to clients. “I view all weakness in Apple over the next month as likely making this stock quite attractive.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for WorkersPrivate Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a DatabaseThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-shares-tanking-levels-traders-202301385.html
2024-03-05T19:46:24.000Z,VUG vs. VGT: Which Tech-Heavy ETF Is the Better Buy?,"ETFs allow investors to diversify their capital without much effort. Fund managers either take an active approach and carefully monitor individual positions or align their funds with established benchmarks. Vanguard is one of the leading firms that specializes in these types of funds. This article will dive into two popular Vanguard funds, one of which is tech-heavy, while the other is tech-exclusive: the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).I am bullish on both of these funds, but it’s important to know the nuances of each fund before getting started. This article will examine their similarities and differences so you can decide which one makes sense for you.Both of these funds have been neck-and-neck over the past year. VGT is up by 48.2%, while VUG has gained 47.8%. There is a larger gap between the funds when looking at five-year performances. While VGT gained 166.1% during that time, VUG was only up by 121.6%.Even though VGT has been the clear winner over the past five years, it’s hard to complain about the performance of either of these funds.Investors don’t even have to worry much about these funds’ expense ratios eating away the returns. Vanguard is well-known for having low expense ratios for its funds, and the brokerage firm certainly delivers for these picks. VUG has a 0.04% expense ratio, while VGT has a 0.10% expense ratio.There’s more to VUG and VGT than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, these two stocks are the largest positions in both funds by wide margins.VUG offers more portfolio diversification for assets outside of these two tech giants. Microsoft makes up 13.2% of the fund’s total holdings, while Apple consists of 12.2% of the fund’s total assets. More than a quarter of VUG’s total holdings are in those two stocks.VGT is even more lopsided toward those tech conglomerates. The fund has 20.5% of its total assets in Microsoft and puts 20.2% of its capital into Apple. Those two stocks make up more than 40% of VGT’s total holdings.VUG has the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven within its top 10 holdings. However, VGT deviates from this trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the only other Magnificent Seven stock within the fund’s top 10 holdings, as you can see below.While the five-year returns imply VGT is the better pick, this is a classic case of past results not guaranteeing future success. Although VGT has a big lead for that time horizon, VUG has outperformed it over the past six months. VUG is also the year-to-date winner, with a 10.5% return compared to VGT’s 8.6% return.I believe this trend will continue for a few reasons. The first reason is Apple stock. Although shares are up by 320% over the past five years, they are only up by 14.4% over the past year. Apple stock is actually down by 4% over the past six months.More than 20% of VGT’s portfolio is down by 4% over the past six months. That distinction only applies to roughly 12% of VUG’s total portfolio. Now, Apple can turn things around if the Vision Pro becomes the next big product, and I believe that product has the potential to deliver great returns. However, the rest of the company’s growth slowed down significantly and offers very limited upside other than the Vision Pro.Another big reason VUG looks more enticing is the portfolio composition. With Apple’s growth slowing, investors have to pay more attention to the other stocks in these funds’ portfolios. While both funds have Nvidia as their third largest holding, the funds deviate from there.VUG takes the expected approach of loading up on the Magnificent Seven stocks. That’s proven to be a good long-term decision, and those corporations have plenty of runway, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for now.I also have an issue with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) being VGT’s 9th largest holding. That stock makes up 1.56% of the fund’s total assets but hasn’t budged by much over the years.Cisco stock is down by 6% over the past five years. While its dividend puts the investment in the positive, that’s not the pick you want to see in a growth fund’s portfolio. VGT has better five-year returns, but I believe VUG is poised to perform better over the next five years.VUG is rated as a Strong Buy based on 172 Buys, 35 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average VUG stock price target of $378.47 implies 12.5% upside potential.Meanwhile, VGT is rated as a Moderate Buy, with 231 Buys, 76 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VGT stock price target of $575.87 implies 11.5% upside potential. Nonetheless, analysts’ ratings suggest VUG will continue to extend its recent lead.Comparing stock charts doesn’t always yield the correct answer of which fund is the better pick. That seems to be the case with these funds. VGT has the better five-year returns but was more reliant on Apple’s ascent. VUG still has significant exposure to Apple but is better prepared for a slowdown in that stock.If Apple’s Vision Pro turns the stock into a winner again, VGT will outperform VUG, but that’s not guaranteed to happen. Both of these funds are heavily dependent on Microsoft and Apple, but it looks like VUG has better top 10 holdings than VGT.Disclosure",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/vug-vs-vgt-tech-heavy-194624798.html
2024-03-05T19:29:26.000Z,YouTube and Facebook hit by mass tech outage,"Users of YouTube and Facebook experienced disruption this afternoon, with hundreds of thousands of users reporting problems.Issues began around 3pm, with the outage affecting Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google. The outages have been tracked by the website Downdetector.At 5:19pm, Meta announced that the outage affecting its services was now over. Google told The Telegraph that it “saw a surge in traffic ... and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.”London-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.”But the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, which are typically imposed by governments.According to a Google status website, there were also reports of problems with some of its services aimed at advertisers.It is understood that the outages were not caused by a cyberattack.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today. Chris and I will be back tomorrow to cover all the latest Budget news and analyst. In the meantime, here are some of the latest business stories from elsewhere on The Telegraph website:Currys investor hits out at ‘absurdity’ of London Stock Exchange as more companies prepare to quitUS lenders risk triggering new financial crisis, warns IMFMorgan Stanley expert admits no support for hitting Mike Ashley with $1bn demandThe Australian entrepreneur behind collapsed supply-chain finance business Greensill Capital is suing the British Government over alleged misuse of private information.High Court records show Lex Greensill filed a lawsuit against the Department for Business and Trade last week, although details of the claim have not yet been made public.A spokesman for Mr Greensill and the Business Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.Greensill, which at one stage was valued at $3.5bn (£2.75bn) filed for administration in 2021 after one of its insurers failed to renew its cover and it was unable to repay a $140m loan to Credit Suisse. Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.Its failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.Lord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.A Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:We saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services. We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”NBC News has reported on comments by a senior official from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in a call with journalists. The official said:We are aware of the incident and at this time we are not aware of any specific election nexus or any specific malicious cyber activity.Surging demand for weight-loss drugs helped to save Denmark from recession last year, a leading bank has said. Hannah Boland reports:Danske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.The stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.Analysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”Novo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.The company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.Sales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.High levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc.The FTSE 100 closed up 0.08pc today. The biggest riser was Intertek, up 6.15pc, followed by Endeavour Mining, up 4.24pc.

Meanwhile, Google’s Ad Manager is experiencing “service disruption”, according to its official status page, while Google is “investigating reports of an issue” with its AdMob and AdSense services. These are used by advertisers.Here’s an update on our earlier mention of a Facebook outage reported by tens of thousands of people.Users of Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Messenger platforms are experiencing login issues in what appears to be a widespread outage.Internet traffic observer Downdetector is reporting big outages across the world.London-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said on X that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “currently experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.” But the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering,” which are typically imposed by governments.Andy Stone, Meta’s head communications, acknowledged the issues on X, formerly known as Twitter, and said the company is “working on this now.”A French billionaire vying to buy British grocery haulier Wincanton has dropped out of the takeover race.CMA CGM, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Rodolphe Saadé, said it would not be increasing its 480p a share offer.The move ends a bidding war between CMA CGM and rival GXO Logistics.US-based GXO offered a knockout bid of 605p a share last week, double the Wincanton share price prior to the takeover battle.The higher offer has the support of Wincanton’s largest shareholders, Aberforth Partners, Threadneedle, Wellcome Trust and Polar Capital. Shares in Wincanton fell 4.5pc to 596p.The business was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate.Today its main business is running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose.Tesco is to increase store workers’ pay by 9.1pc in an act worth roughly £300m.It is the latest supermarket group to lift pay levels for workers ahead of the rise in the national minimum wage in April.The national minimum wage will increase from its current rate of £10.42 per hour to £11.44 on April 1.The grocery giant, which employs more than 330,000 people across the UK, will raise the basic hourly rate for store workers from £11.02 per hour to £12.02.It will also increase the pay of workers within the M25 to £13.15 per hour, from a current rate of £11.95 for those in inner London and £11.75 for those in outer London.Tesco UK chief executive Matthew Barnes said:This represents another significant investment in our colleagues, building on the last two years of investment.We recognise the amazing work our colleagues do every day in serving our customers and we’re really proud to offer such competitive rates of pay alongside a great range of exclusive colleague benefits.It comes days after rival Asda said it will increase its basic rate of staff pay to £12.04 per hour later this year.Mike Lynch, the British businessman accused of a multibillion-dollar fraud over the sale of his software company to Hewlett Packard, has settled a legal fight with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) days before he is due to go on trial in the US.A spokesman for Mr Lynch said he had reached a settlement with the SFO. Mr Lynch took the fraud office to court last month in an effort to force it to hand over correspondence with US authorities, information that he believes could help his upcoming US criminal defence.Details of the settlement are confidential. Mr Lynch has been charged with fraud over the sale of the former FTSE 100 software company Autonomy in 2011 and denies the allegations. His trial is scheduled to start on March 18.A Silicon Valley giant whose processors are widely used in personal computers and data centres has hit a US government roadblock in its efforts to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market, as Washington cracks down on the export of advanced technologies to BeijingAccording to a Bloomberg report, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tried to get the US Commerce Department’s go-ahead.However, officials said it must obtain a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security as the chip was too powerful despite being weaker than what the company sells outside China, and has been designed to meet US export restrictions, the report said.The Telegraph has approached AMD and the Commerce Department for comment.AMD shares are down 2.12pc today as investors feared that the reported development could hamper its efforts to catch up with AI front-runner Nvidia, whose semiconductors have captured more than 80pc of the market for the advanced chips.Apple shares have fallen to their lowest level for five months after figures showed its sales in China were slumping amid the resurgent fortunes of rival Huawei, writes James Titcomb:Counterpoint Research said sales of the iPhone had fallen by 24pc during the first six weeks of 2024. It meant that Apple fell from the country’s second biggest smartphone maker a year ago to fourth.Apple shares fell by more than 2.5pc in early trading in New York and have now dropped to their lowest level since late October. So far this year shares have fallen 8pc amid growing concern about its Chinese business.Huawei’s smartphone division had been hit by US sanctions but breakthroughs in chip design mean sales have climbed 64pc in the last year.Thousands of users have reported difficulty accessing Faceboook this afternoon.According to the website Downdetector, over 90,000 people after 3pm have said they are experiencing an outage.

It has already fallen to 10pc from January.Jeremy Hunt has decided to cut NI after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.Government sources said the average worker would save £450 as a result of the latest cut to NI. Use our calculator, below, to see how much you’ll save both from this cut, and the previous one that took effect in January this year.Use our tool to work out how much Jeremy Hunt’s reduction will benefit you.Elon Musk has condemned “dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth” after Tesla was forced to halt production at its Berlin gigafactory following a suspected arson which Far-left German protesters have claimed credit for.These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they're puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals. Stopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2024Rupert Murdoch is taking TalkTV off air to staunch heavy losses, weeks after Piers Morgan’s show retreated to YouTube.Our reporter James Warrington has the details:Mr Murdoch’s News UK has confirmed that TalkTV will shut down its terrestrial channel, and will move to streaming-only from early summer. It comes after it struggled to attract audiences and was eclipsed by fellow opinion-led upstart broadcaster GB News.In a memo to staff seen by The Telegraph, Scott Taunton, News UK’s head of broadcasting, said: “We now need to focus our investment on where the eyeballs are and where the revenues are in growth.“In order to be successful, we need to prioritise being where the audiences are, rather than asking them to come to find us down the channel guide.”Read what else is behind the move.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned the tax burden will still hit record levels in the coming years, even if the Chancellor cuts 2p from National Insurance in his Budget on Wednesday:The Chancellor will reportedly announce a 2p cut to National Insurance contributions in tomorrow's Budget.  Based on forecasts from last autumn, that tax cut would not – by itself – be enough to prevent taxes as a share of GDP from rising to record levels in 2028-29. pic.twitter.com/NQLqdl3aAr— Institute for Fiscal Studies (@TheIFS) March 5, 2024The pound traded listlessly as currency markets remained sluggish, with sterling traders looking towards the Budget as a potential catalyst.Sterling was last down 0.1pc at $1.26, sticking to the $1.28 to $1.25 range it has traded in since November. The euro was also little changed against the pound at 85p.The main event for investors in the UK this week is the Budget in which Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will cut National Insurance by 2p - after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.Joe Tuckey, head of FX analysis at broker Argentex, said:While it is normal for the budget to not induce any real currency volatility, the muscle memory of the Truss/Kwarteng horror show could still create a twitch.If the gilt market (British government bonds) gets a sniff of any tax cut pledge being unworkable, we could see sterling trade nervously.The historic shipyard that built the Titanic is on course to win a contract worth up to £120m to build a new port for the Falkland Islands.Our industry editor Matt Oliver has the latest:Harland & Wolff has been chosen as the “preferred bidder” by the Falkland government following a tender process, the Belfast-based company announced on Tuesday.The project will involve building a floating dock, which will be connected to the island by a separately-constructed access road and causeway.On Tuesday, Harland said the contract was subject to final negotiations on pricing and commercial arrangements but could potentially be worth £100-120 million over two years.Read how finalising the deal would be a boost to Harland & Wolff.Oil prices edged lower as China’s target for economic growth this year failed to impress investors.Global benchmark Brent fell 0.2pc towards $82 a barrel after slipping 0.9pc on Monday, while West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.4pc near $78.China’s National People’s Congress received only a lukewarm response from investors after it set its annual growth target at around 5pc, raising expectations for officials to unleash more stimulus as they try to lift confidence in a slowing economy.The nation also set a more ambitious target for reducing the energy needed for economic expansion, or energy intensity, this year.But there was no big package of stimulus for the world’s second largest economy - and top consumer of oil - to help boost markets and reassure worried investors.US retail giant Target has reported a 58pc increase in its fourth-quarter profits as the discounter cut costs, beating Wall Street expectations.Revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with comparable sales — those from stores or digital channels operating at least 12 months — slipped 4.4pc.But that was a smaller decline than the 4.9pc drop in Target’s third quarter and a 5.4pc drop in the second quarter.The Minneapolis retailer offered a cautious outlook for its sales and profits.A cost-cutting campaign helped the retailer’s profits rebound after it was burdened with too much stock in the summer of 2022. The inventory glut forced it to discount heavily — and the effects lingered for a few quarters.US stock indexes dipped in premarket trading as investors await several key events this week, including a congressional appearance from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.The benchmark S&P 500 hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower as investor focus turned to Mr Powell’s testimony on Wednesday and Thursday that could offer more cues on the Fed’s monetary policy path.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: “In this testimony, Powell will likely ask for more patience regarding the timing of the first rate cut, he will probably say that inflation is on the right path but that they don’t want to lower their guard too early.”Traders see a 65.5pc chance of the first rate cut this year arriving in June, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said said on Monday that the Fed is under no urgent pressure to cut interest rates given a “prospering” economy and job market.Ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 had dropped 0.2pc and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.6pc.Regus owner IWG has hinted at the possibility of a US listing as it said a “rapid uptake” of hybrid working has driven the fastest growth in its 35-year history.WeWork rival IWG added a record 867 locations globally in 2023 and managed its highest-ever system-wide revenue of £3.3bn.Bosses said that hybrid working is a long-term shift that is “one of the mega-trends of our time,” adding that companies have ditched city centre offices in favour of suburban locations close to where people live.The company added that it will begin reporting its earnings in dollars in future and hinted at the possibility of switching its stock market listing to the US.It is reviewing the adoption of US GAAP accounting standards and said there would be a “likely announcement regarding the company’s intentions” during the first half of this year.IWG shares have fallen by 5pc today.GB News’s losses have ballooned to £42.4m despite a jump in revenues as the broadcaster spent heavily on high-profile presenters.Luke Barr has the details:The outspoken news channel plunged further into the red in 2023 after losses widened from £30.7m in 2022.Growth in viewing figures led to turnover almost doubling to £6.7m last year, but income remains only a fraction of the channel’s expenses.Losses were fuelled by investment in salaries for high-profile presenters such as Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who joined in January 2023. GB News’s wage bill surged from £12.7m to £21.2m in 2023, newly filed accounts show.Read how the channel has deepened its reliance on billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Marshall.Jeremy Hunt will cut National Insurance by a further two percentage points for 27 million British workers in his Budget tomorrow.The Chancellor will make the reduction, worth about £450 to the average worker, a central pledge of his speech, having opted against a more expensive reduction in income tax. Government sources confirmed the move.Mr Hunt has been scrambling to find room for pre-election giveaways after the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded the amount of space he has for tax cuts.Around 25,000 Greggs workers will share £17.6m in bonuses this month after the high street bakery chain notched up a 27% hike in annual profits.The group’s boss, Roisin Currie, said the staff will be given the bonus in their pay packets at the end of March to recognise their “hard work and effort” over 2023.It comes after Greggs delivered a bumper pre-tax profit of £188.3m for 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops jumped 13.7pc.The new car market recorded its strongest February in 20 years, figures show.Nearly 85,000 new cars were registered last month, an increase of 14pc compared with February 2023, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.That is the highest February total since 2004 when more than 91,000 new cars were registered.February is a low-volume month for sales ahead of the introduction of new number plates on March 1, which sparks a surge in purchases.The SMMT reiterated its plea for “fairer” taxation of electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of Wednesday’s Budget as private uptake continues to struggle.Private buyers accounted for just 18.2pc of new battery electric vehicles registered in the first two months of this year, with the overall 21.3pc increase in demand entirely sustained by fleets due to tax incentives.The SMMT is urging Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to halve VAT on the purchase of new EVs, amend plans to introduce vehicle excise duty for EVs, and reduce VAT on public charging to bring it into line with home charging.The UK’s dominant services sector continued to grow last month in a sign that Britain has “turned a corner” from its recession, according to new data.The influential S&P Global/CIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 53.8 in February, showing private sector businesses expanded for a fourth month in a row, although growth slowed marginally from 54.3 in January.Any reading above 50 indicates growth for the sector, and below means decline.Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:Another solid expansion of business activity across the service sector in February adds to signs that the UK economy has turned a corner after entering a technical recession during the second half of 2023.New business intakes were a particularly bright spot as service providers reported the fastest order book growth since May 2023.Survey respondents cited rising business and consumer spending, linked to improved optimism towards the broader economic outlook.A turnaround in customer demand and the prospect of interest cuts on the horizon helped to boost business optimism across the service economy.The UK construction sector is unlikely to see any serious recovery until after the general election expected later this year, Travis Perkins has said.The seller of construction products said that its customers are waiting to see if a potential new government will announce any support for the sector and where interest rates will go.It said: “A recovery in the UK construction sector is unlikely to gather any momentum before the UK general election is concluded with the group’s customers, large and small, inevitably waiting to see if there is a post-election government stimulus package for the sector and also seeking clarity on the future direction of interest rates.”It comes as the country is widely expected to go to the polls some time this year. The Government has to hold an election before January 28, 2025.Travis Perkins also said that it was planning to possibly exit its French Toolstation business, which has 51 shops across the country.It made a loss of £19m last year, up from £15m the year before, even though sales grew 11pc.Government borrowing costs have eased ahead of the Budget, where the Chancellor is expected to announce a “responsible” set of policies, according to minister Greg Hands today.The yield on 10-year UK gilts have fallen three basis points to 4.08pc and are under greater scrutiny after Liz Truss’ mini-Budget in 2022 caused a crisis in bond markets.Hal Cook, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:Gilt markets have been under pressure for some time, due to the combination of high inflation, increasing interest rates, higher levels of government bond issuance post Covid and the Bank of England selling its gilt holdings back to the market.This has made UK gilts less attractive investments compared to cash and the increased supply has also worked against gilt prices.There has been significant retail investor interest in gilt auctions more recently, highlighted when the demand at HL’s auction was fivefold more than expected last week.So, how events such as the Budget impact prices of gilts is more important than ever to many investors.This, coupled with increased investments into bond funds more generally over the last 12 to 18 months, makes the impact of the upcoming Budget on bond values of interest to a much wider audience than previously.Bond markets across Europe have improved as money markets expect the European Central Bank to leave interest rates at their record highs of 4pc on Thursday.Jeff Bezos has usurped Elon Musk as the world’s richest man with a net worth of $200bn (£158bn) after a surge in the share price of Amazon.Our senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:The Amazon founder, 60, overtook his rival for the first time in three years, with Mr Musk now sitting on a fortune worth $198bn, according to Bloomberg data.The pair’s fortunes are largely tied to their respective holdings in online retail giant Amazon and electric car maker Tesla.Amazon’s shares have climbed 18pc so far this year, valuing the business at more than $1.8 trillion as technology stocks rocket on the back of a wave of optimism about artificial intelligence.At the same time, Tesla’s share price has slipped by 24pc in 2024 as investors grow wary of the level of demand for electric cars. Its stock fell by 7pc on Monday after it announced further price cuts in China in an effort to stimulate demand.See how Amazon and Tesla’s share prices have diverged.Tesla has reportedly been forced to halt production at its German gigafactory after a fire at a nearby pylon which local media speculated was started by environmental activists.Power was knocked out in the area around the electric car maker’s Gruenheide factory near Berlin, although fire crews said the blaze had not spread to the plant itself.Police said the fire brigade was working to put out the fire on the electricity pylon, which is in a nearby field.A police spokesman said they could not comment on a report by the BZ newspaper which said that the fire was started by environmental activists and that bomb disposal units were called in after emergency services found a sign saying “ordnance buried here”.It was also reported by BZ that the fire had brought car production to a halt at the plant.Tesla’s aims to expand its plant, which has a capacity of around 500,000 cars a year, but it has faced opposition from environmental campaigners and local residents, who voted down a motion to fell trees to pave the way for the factory’s growth.Tesla has been contacted for comment.There is just one day to go until Jeremy Hunt unveils his next plans for the economy in his Budget.A Government minister has said today that a responsible budget would involve a “balance” between giving people “a bit of a tax break this year” and “still keeping a record amount of funding into public services”.Greg Hands asked that people “judge us on our record” as he declined to say whether cuts to public services would follow the Chancellor’s upcoming announcement.Asked whether there would be a reduction in funding, the trade minister told Sky News:Judge us on our record so far. It’s not for me to reveal today what might be in the Budget tomorrow but I would say there’s record numbers of police officers, record numbers of doctors, record numbers of nurses.”I think a responsible budget will be making sure the country and economy continues to recover from the pandemic, from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the spike in inflation that we’ve had to deal with, and I think that means continuing to put record amount of funding into public services while still giving the British people, I think, a bit of a tax break this year as well.Google’s head of Israel was accused by an employee of overseeing technology that is “powering genocide” as he was interrupted during a speech at a conference.Barak Regev, the managing director of Google Israel, stopped speaking as a man identifying himself as a cloud engineer for the US tech giant stood up and criticised its Project Nimbus cloud computing work for the Israeli government and its military.Announced April 2021, the Israeli Finance Ministry said the $1.2bn project is to provide “the government, the defense establishment, and others with an all-encompassing cloud solution.”Critics have argued the technology allows Israel to collect unlawful data on Palestinians and to increase surveillance.Video shared on social media shows Mr Regev addressing the MindTheTech conference in New York before a man stands up and identifies himself as a Google cloud software engineer.Watch what he shouts below:A Google Cloud engineer just interrupted Google Israel managing director Barak Regev at Israeli tech industry conference MindTheTech this morning in NY.""I refuse to build technology that powers genocide!"" he yelled, referring to Google's Project Nimbus contract pic.twitter.com/vM9mMFlJRS— Caroline Haskins (@car0linehaskins) March 4, 2024Britain’s blue-chip stock index fell to a near-three week low as it was dragged down by Ashtead Group and commodity-linked shares.The FTSE 100 slipped 0.3pc to touch its lowest level since February 16.Shares of commodity majors such as BP, Shell and Glencore fell about a per cent each as oil and metal prices dipped after investors were unimpressed by pledges by China to transform its economy amid stuttering growth since the pandemic.Ashtead dropped 6.7pc and was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 after the British equipment rental firm forecast full-year group rental revenue at the lower end of 11pc-13pc growth range.The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.Shares of Spirent Communications rocketed by 58.7pc after US-based communications equipment firm Viavi Solutions agreed to buy the British company in a deal valued at about £1bn.Inchcape fell 9.3pc to the bottom of the midcap index after the car dealership said it expects “moderated growth” in the short term.The publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has seen its profits tumble by a third after rolling out sweeping job cuts.Our reporter James Warrington has the latest:Reach posted a statutory operating profit of £46.1m in 2023, down more than 35pc on the previous year.This was largely driven by restructuring charges after the company cut around 800 roles as part of a wider cost-cutting drive. Stripping out the impact of the restructuring, profits fell 9pc to £96.5m.The figures cap off a torrid year for the publisher, which is grappling with a sharp downturn in advertising and the impact of social media algorithm changes.Digital advertising revenues tumbled 15pc, which Reach blamed on wider economic uncertainty and a “material reduction in page views” after Facebook deprioritised news content.However, its shares gained 10.1pc in early trading.Stock indexes in London have fallen at the open after investors were unimpressed by China’s 5pc annual growth target for its economy.The internationally-focused FTSE 100 was down 0.3pc to 7,617.01 while the midcap FTSE 250 dropped 0.7pc to 19,227.74.London estate agent Foxtons said the lettings market has “normalised” as fewer tenants battle for each property.The company said it thinks the rental sector will “remain resilient” this year, adding that  more properties have become available to rent.The estate agent revealed a slump in profits as it closed branches and incurred £4.5m of costs as part of its takeover of rival Ludlow Thompson.Pre-tax profits were down 34pc to £7.9m but revenue grew by 5pc to £147.1m in 2023 as mortgages became more affordable.It said sales had outperformed the market amid a recovery in buyer demand levels, with a 31pc increase in the value of homes under offer at the end of February compared to the previous year.British technology testing and security business Spirent will be taken over by Viavi in a £1bn deal in the latest overseas swoop on a UK-listed company.Communications equipment business Viavi will offer 172.5p per share and a special dividend of 2.5p per share as part of the deal, which represents a 61.4pc premium on Spirent’s closing price of 108.4p on Monday.There has been a flurry of merger and acquisition activity of UK companies since the turn of the year, as many businesses are perceived to be undervalued.Last week, US logistics company GXO tabled an official bid for British grocery haulier Wincanton in a takeover battle with French shipping business CMA CGM.Greggs revealed it would pay a final dividend of 46p per share after revealing record profits, taking its total ordinary dividend per share of 62p per share, up 5.1pc from 2022.Charlie Huggins of Wealth Club said:Greggs has enjoyed an excellent year despite the challenging economic environment. Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.There is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.This sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.Key to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless. And it is continually improving the offering.Overall, the future looks bright for Greggs and 2024 should be another year of progress.High street bakery chain Greggs has cheered a record annual performance as it notched up a 27pc hike in full-year profits, but revealed slowing sales growth.The group reported pre-tax profits of £188.3m in 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rose 13.7pc.It saw sales growth slow to 9.4pc in the final three months of the year as there was less contribution from price inflation.The group added that comparable store sales growth slowed further, to 8.2pc in the first nine weeks of 2024.But the company said it was “confident that Greggs can deliver another year of good progress” and remains on track to open between 140 to 160 shops this year after opening a record 220 shops in 2023.Bitcoin’s runaway rally is being driven by investors in Asia.Traders in South Korea, China and other Asian countries are responsible for roughly 70pc of bitcoin trading volumes, much like they were in 2021 when bitcoin last hit such heady highs, according to crypto exchange data from The Block.Asia accounted for $791bn of the $1.17 trillion worth of bitcoin traded in February, with North American investors lagging way behind with $113bn, broadly reflecting a trend seen since November, the data shows.In China, FOMO (the fear of missing out) has gripped many small investors frustrated with an anaemic stock market. On popular messaging app WeChat, searches for “bitcoin” jumped 12-fold in February.Mia Wang, a finance industry employee based in China’s eastern province of Zhejiang, told Reuters:I want to buy some bitcoin at a good price and hold.It has jumped a lot and is expensive now, but I worry it won’t have any correction.Bitcoin’s surge that has taken it close to its record highs could be a bubble, a Wall Street investment bank has warned, as global stock markets also jumped to all-time peaks.JPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.Bitcoin continued its ascent to a fresh two-year peak of $68,828 that put it within spitting distance of an all-time high.There are also signs of wider exuberance across markets, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite all hitting record highs last week - and the Nikkei in Japan surpassing 40,000 for the first time on Monday.Mr Kolanovic said: “Equities have moved up this year, even as bond yields rose and rate cut expectations unwound.“Investors may be assuming that the increase in yields is reflective of economic acceleration, but earnings projections for 2024 are coming down and the market appears too complacent on the cycle.”Bitcoin has gained 50pc this year and most of the rise has come in the last few weeks after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.The so-called spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened the way for new large investors and has reignited enthusiasm and momentum reminiscent of the run up to record levels in 2021.Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com, said:It’s crypto mania 4.0, and I think if we continue to see fairly low bond and rate volatility, it could keep going.There’s definitely something of an irrational behaviour creeping into the market.Thanks for joining me. Bitcoin has surged close to its record high and global stocks are also hitting fresh peaks - but a Wall Street bank is ringing alarm bells about the risk of a bubble.JPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.1) IT chaos and staff exodus threaten Britain’s ability to raise crucial debt | Illegal activity in government bond auctions risks going undetected, a Parliamentary committee has warned2) Jaguar Land Rover owner to split off its cars division in EV shift | Tata Motors prepares for a future built around battery-powered vehicles3) Issa brothers slash investment at petrol station empire in battle to pay down debts | Billionaires roll out ‘controlled reduction’ at EG Group to maximise liquidity4) Non-dom tax raid risks backfiring on Hunt, warns IFS | New rules threaten to drive away super rich and diminish revenues, says think tank5) Ben Marlow: Britain must not bend the knee to China – despite being on the brink of a death spiral | There are less grubby ways to inject life back into our moribund stock marketMost Asian stocks slid as the start of China’s week-long annual session of parliament disappointed investors with its lack of big ticket stimulus plans to prop up the struggling economy.The Chinese government retained last year’s target for economic growth of “around 5pc” for this year, and announced plans to run a budget deficit of 3pc of economic output, down from a revised 3.8pc last year.It also unveiled plans to issue 1 trillion yuan (£109bn) in special ultra-long term treasury bonds, which are not included in the budget.Mainland stocks reversed early losses with the blue-chip CSI 300 up about 0.5pc, amid signs of suspected state-backed buying of some exchange-traded funds.However, that failed to lift other markets in the region with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng deepening earlier declines to 2.7pc.Tokyo’s key Nikkei index closed flat after hitting a fresh record the previous day as chip shares trimmed gains.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was little changed, down 11.60 points to end at 40,097.63, while the broader Topix index climbed 0.5pc, or 13.65 points, to 2,719.93.US shares edged down from their record heights in a quiet Monday on Wall Street. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1pc, to 5,130.95, coming off its latest all-time high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 major American companies dipped 0.2pc, to 38,989.83, and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.4pc, to 16,207.51.The yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury bonds rose to 4.21pc from 4.18pc late on Friday.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

2024-03-05T19:10:09.000Z,"Federal appeals court throws out lawsuit against Apple, Google, Tesla and other tech giants over alleged child labor in Congo","A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit that sought to hold Apple, Google, Tesla and other major tech companies liable for their alleged use of child labor to mine cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The DC Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous ruling that while the plaintiffs who brought the suit in 2019 had the legal right — known as standing — to bring the case, they had failed to satisfy the legal elements necessary to pursue their claims against the companies.“Purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt through the global supply chain is not ‘participation in a venture’ within the meaning of’ federal anti-trafficking law,” Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote in the court’s ruling.“The plaintiffs have not adequately alleged the Tech Companies participated in a venture because there is no shared enterprise between the Companies and the suppliers who facilitate forced labor,” Rao wrote. “The Tech Companies own no interest in their suppliers. Nor do the Tech Companies share in the suppliers’ profits and risks.”But, Rao noted, “the cobalt suppliers and their subsidiaries actively solicit and force children to work in order to meet the Tech Companies’ growing demand for cobalt.”Cobalt is a major component of lithium-ion batteries found in virtually every rechargeable electronic gadget. Two-thirds of the world’s cobalt comes from Congo.A federal judge in DC had previously thrown the case out. But the group of plaintiffs, which includes former underage miners who were injured in cobalt mining accidents and the guardians of children who were killed while working in cobalt mines, turned to the appeals court in 2021 to revive their suit.The defendants in the case were Apple, Alphabet (which owns Google), Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla.The class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of the plaintiffs by International Rights Advocates, which had claimed that the children were exploited and hurt in mining operations linked to the mining companies Glencore, Umicore and Huayou Cobalt, which the group said supply to either some or all of the defendants. None of those companies were listed as defendants.Michelle Toh contributed to this report.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/federal-appeals-court-throws-lawsuit-191009871.html
2024-03-05T23:28:40.000Z,"UPDATE 4-US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa","(Adds Dell statement, paragraph 12)By Jonathan StempelMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""Dell said in a statement it was committed to upholding the human rights of workers throughout its supply chain, and has never knowingly sourced products made with child labor.Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show. None was named as a defendant.The case is Doe 1 et al v Apple Inc et al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-7135.

Models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time. That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest.Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Cathy Hackl, a futurist, author, and an Apple Vision Pro developer. Deidre Woollard caught up with Hackl for a conversation about spatial computing. They discuss how this technology could change meetings, manufacturing, and remodeling a kitchen, what the beginning of mobile can teach us about this computing revolution, and the difference between the technology and value in the Apple Vision Pro.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about spatial computing. This is all about the Vision Pro. Apple wants us to believe this is the future of how we interact with technology. What's your take?Cathy Hackl: I want to start by saying that I think we need to take a step back, we're going to talk about the hype, of course, but not frame that conversation spatial computing around just one single device, and this is why. Because when you start to think about spatial computing, I think a lot of people are thinking of it in the context of only the Apple Vision Pro or some people might use it interchangeably with the word mixed reality. I am of a different mindset. I don't think that this is the same. Just like the internet is not the same thing as our mobile phone, I don't think special computing is the same as one single device or one single technology.What I mean by that is that spatial computing is an evolving form of computing that is 3D-centric and that uses technologies like AI, computer vision, mixed reality, and other technologies to blend virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world into a human's experience of the physical world. That being said, through spatial computing, we're also allowing technology, computers, robots, devices, hardware to start to navigate the physical world with us. It's a combination of a lot of new technologies and about human-to-human communication, but also human-to-computer interaction and it is not about one single thing.I would even go as far as saying this is a new field of technology and it is as revolutionary as mobile computing has been for all of us. Spatial computing I think people need to take a step back and realize what we're talking about here is the future of computing, the future of how we as humans will interact with technology in new ways, and not just one device or one single technology or even the metaverse and I know we're going to get into that.Deidre Woollard: I have to ask you, have you played with or used the Vision Pro and how does that relate to this overarching theory of spatial computing?Cathy Hackl: Definitely have used the device. I am personally an Apple Vision Pro developer, so I actually had a chance to try the device before many people did. I just couldn't speak about it publicly. Obviously, lots of NDAs and stuff, but now everything's out in the open. I had done things with it before. Obviously, when it came out to the public, I went and bought my personal unit and everything. I've definitely tried the device. I think the device is magical. I think a lot of people, when they first tried the device, they have this ""aha"" moment of awe of seeing technology in a new way in most of the people that I have noticed doing the reviews or doing their demos.I definitely have seen that throughout my career in technology when people try these new technologies. That being said, I think the device, and I've said this before, I think there is $3,500 worth of technology in the device. As of yet, I don't think there's $3,500 worth of value to the regular consumer. There is value there for developers like myself. Maybe for enterprises not yet, but because it's really early. It is a fantastic product. I think it is doing a lot of great things. It is extremely powerful, and another thing I think a lot of people don't realize is how much artificial intelligence is being used in this device. It's a version 1. It is the right product at the right time, to be honest, but it's not a mass-market product yet.Deidre Woollard: I love that you made that distinction between the value of it and the value to consumers. I'm curious, though, since you were a developer on this, how does developing for this vary with other experiences you've had before?Cathy Hackl: This one is a little bit different because, obviously, it's really new hardware that very few people had access to. Even the development process, you have to have a computer that has at least an M2 chip, so M3, M2. I think that in itself prices out maybe some developers from developing for this. If you want to develop using Unity, you have to have a Unity license. There's certain things I think right now that might make it hard for maybe a young kid in their dorm to develop for this. They could still develop using some of the native, let's say AR Kit or some of the native Apple part of the Apple ecosystem. But if you want to develop something really robust, you're going to need certain capabilities. So I would say that.I will say, though, because the device is so amazing and truly blends that physical world and virtual experience together, the possibilities of what we can develop are truly mind-blowing. As a developer, it is both an exciting challenge and an opportunity to start to create experiences that have never been created, that no one's really thought of, and that take full advantage of that value that is in the device, in the technology within the device. I think once we have more developers creating amazing content, we'll get to that point where there is going to be more value for the consumer, for the mass market. We're just not there yet with that part, but that's where the work of someone like myself, it's facial dynamics, comes into play. We need to create this content, we need to push the limits of the hardware and the technology and truly create mind-bending experiences.Deidre Woollard: Fantastic. Well, I'm curious about that because thinking about when the iPhone came out and there was not a lot of development. You had a few cool things you could do, but it was really two years later that ecosystem developed. Do you see a similar timeline happening here?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. This is version 1 and I would say this is like the beginning of mobile. It's really early. First of all, there might be a lot of apps available for the Vision Pro. That doesn't mean that discovering them is easy or that finding them is easy within the Vision Pro ecosystem when you're wearing the device, and that doesn't mean that all these apps are using the full capability of what the device can do in spatial computing. I want to be very clear about that. It is early. We're all testing and learning, even with the companies that I'm already working with, the early adopters. It's about exploring the potential of what this can become. It is about what are the early learnings that you can start to take when you're creating these new apps and new experiences.Because if you look at spatial computing from the perspective that it is the evolution of computing and that it is what comes after mobile computing and you start to think about it's not about just the device, but it's about every surface or the physical world around you becoming a spatial interface, then it starts to get interesting. Another thing I've noticed with the companies I'm working with is that they're also thinking long-term, and I tell them this. When you start to think about an iPhone 16, an iPhone 17, a Vision Pro 2, a Vision Pro 3 and other hardware that the ecosystem is going to throw at us, then it starts to get more interesting. Especially when you start to think about iPhones with more spatial capabilities, more spatial video, maybe some other things you might be able to do with the phone that you couldn't do before, that's where I think the companies and the mass market and more brands are going to be like, OK, so now maybe it's something we should pay attention to.That's when you start to not be only about 400,000 headsets being sold, but about millions or billions of people with these devices at hand that it starts to have these facial capabilities. A lot of us are playing the long game here. That long game is moving really fast, though. So I do have to say that. When people asked me, do I put it at 5-10 years? I can't tell you. I don't think anyone really can tell you. I would have to have a vision into every one of these companies' road maps to truly tell you is it five years from now, is it 10 years from now? I think we'll have to see and there's a lot of different parts that have to fall into place. This is the other part, which I think is interesting and people forget, is spatial computing has four components. It has the hardware, which obviously we as tech business people, we love overindexing on hardware, taking it apart, talking about all this stuff.There's the software. The software is where there's going to be a lot of work that needs to be done to create this content and create value and experiences. The connectivity. When you start to think about all these devices, if everyone's going to end up wearing glasses and all these devices connecting on edge and the types of connectivity we're going to need. Another level of not even 5G, we're going to need to take 6G and whatever comes next. Then there's also the part of the data, all the information that these devices need to operate because they're literally scanning the physical world almost in real time and then all the data they are going to produce. That obviously has a lot of implications. Long answer, but that's what I think right now.Deidre Woollard: [laughs] Well, as someone who invests in data center REITs, I'm like, ""OK, I see something happening here that I'm interested in."" I also want to talk about so many people focus with spatial computing on the consumer aspect like games and videos and things like that, but there are a lot of business applications here, too. I feel like people are ignoring a little bit of that part. But with spatial computing, thinking about for me from the real estate aspect, you have tremendous capability for business, digital twins, building information modeling. Talk to us a little bit about some of the business applications.Cathy Hackl: Yeah. I think that, obviously, a lot of people want to focus on consumer because that's a little bit more exciting to talk about, shopping and all that. But I think from the business perspective, there's already use cases that have astonishing results. I'll give you an example, Lockheed Martin, for example, used the Microsoft HoloLens, which is in essence a special computing device, and they achieved a 93% reduction in costs on the creation of one part of the manufacturing process for the Orion space vehicle. That's a 93% reduction in cost because they use spatial computing. So there's already a few use cases out there that show you that this technology can be extremely powerful. Spatial computing plus AI, you're starting to talk about revolutionizing a lot of different processes, whether it is manufacturing, whether it is real estate.With this technology, you can actually put the device on and show someone in the physical world what that is going to look like, what that building is going to look like, where the exits are going to be. You're going to be able to walk through a virtual building really, not in virtual reality, but in the physical world, seeing everything around you. That to me is extremely powerful. It's also going to allow you to tour a place that you might not be able to go. You can do that in virtual reality, and there's the Zillow app already in the Vision Pro.But right now it's more like 360 photos that you're walking around, so it's not that sense of presence just yet. But when we start to think about that, I think real estate from decorating your house, and Lowe's is already doing that in their Vision Pro with the kitchen. They have a kitchen demo where you can decorate your demo. But actually seeing what something could look like in the physical world I think is really exciting, or understanding from a construction perspective what the physics of the space could do to the design, the physical design of that house.I think there's a lot that's about to be impacted and because of the devices, but because the physical world becomes a spatial interface, the physical world becomes where we see technology. We no longer have to see it in these little rectangles that we carry around with us or on our computers, it starts to be all around us. So I think that that opens up opportunities for real estate, for finance, for education, manufacturing, of course, HR, you name it. Just like mobile computing has impacted most industries, I believe spatial computing as the evolution of computing, of future compute, will impact almost every industry.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to talk a little bit about this co-presence idea because everybody wants a better meeting experience. When Meta first debuted some of the meeting experiences with the guys with the legs, everybody loved to make fun of that. But it seems like we are getting to a place where maybe we're getting closer to that. I was looking at what [Alphabet's] Google is doing with Project Starline, it feels like we're getting closer to actually making these remote meetings feel a little more like we're really together.Cathy Hackl: I will tell you, I had a demo of Project Starline last year at the Code Conference, and I was blown away. You're sitting in front of someone, you're not wearing a device. It's done through AI and cameras and you're seeing someone through a screen, but the screen is showing you a version of them in 3D, and I was so impressed by the fidelity. I could see someone's pores more than I would normally see them in person. I was like, ""Wow, this is crazy."" Or I remember the person I was doing the demo with had an apple and I literally just wanted to grab the apple from them because they moved the apple forward like they were giving me the apple, of course, I couldn't grab it, but those sorts of things. Something that really stuck with me in the presence part was the pores, but also I was wearing this ring, and you could see the detail on the ring. He could see the detail on the ring in such a way that was even better than eyesight. I don't know how to explain it.Deidre Woollard: Wow.Cathy Hackl: The detail was so clear that he said, OK, this could be really powerful, from a presence perspective. Right now, for example, with the Vision Pro, you can use your personas, which is like a 3D representation of you. It's starting to get a little better. The first couple of weeks very uncanny. It's still very uncanny, but it's starting to get a little bit better. I think they're starting to improve that. I think we'll start to get a little bit more high fidelity, let's say, of how we look in these devices. But the idea of presence, I think that's where it starts to get interesting. That's where it starts to also become something of value and of interest to the mass market because one of the most powerful things I've been able to do on my device is look at the video I took during the holidays with my parents. My dad is turning 80 this year. He's getting older. He's very healthy.But I was like, I'm just going to shoot as much as I can on my iPhone so I can have these facial videos of him reading Llama Llama Red Pajama to my kids, stuff like that that's special. When I put the device on and I can see these experiences in 3D, in spatial video, it's powerful. It's powerful and I'm like, is this the future of the family photo? Is this the future of how we might retain some of those memories? So that's where that idea of presence in real time but presence also after the fact I think could be very powerful and could become one of the reasons that someone like my dad might eventually, in a couple of years, get one of these devices. Just like back in the early mobile days, my dad wasn't on Facebook, [laughs] but he got on Facebook because that's where he could see pictures of his grandbabies. I think it's almost similar right now. But that idea of presence, I think, is going to be huge for human communications, both in the personal side but also the business side.Deidre Woollard: Well, you had mentioned AI earlier and I'm curious about how much you think, as spatial computing evolves, how much of it is going to be about co-presence, looking at memories, person-to-person communication versus person-to-AI communication and collaboration? Does this get us deeper into that? Because I feel like we went through the last year of generative AI, and Copilot, things like that. People are getting more integrated with AI. It seems like spatial computing takes that to a whole another level.Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent in the sense that anyone that's working with a ChatGPT, or a Copilot, or Claude, or whatever it is that you're using from that perspective, we're all engaging with it on our phones or our computers. That's where you're engaging with AI. So when you start to look at all these AI companies, they're all looking for that container, what they call a container, of where they're going to put their AI technology, and that comes in the form of hardware. Whether it is the R1 Rabbit that took over CES, whether it's the Humane AI Pin that a lot of people are curious about, whether it's the Vision Pro or whatever OpenAI and Jony Ive decided to create and bring into the world, it's all containers for how we engage with AI. I think that that's where this interesting conversation starts to happen, it's about engaging with technology in new ways.The other part here that is an important part of the conversation, I think a lot of people are not having this conversation or understanding it, is that right now a lot of the generative AI that we're talking about is large language models trained on language. Even when you look at something like Sora or Runway, it's trained on video, but it's video of things that have already happened or photos of things that have already been created or happened. Once you start to have these devices that are scanning the physical world in real time, you start to create what I call large vision models, models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time.That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest. But I see the evolution of what comes after large language models as large vision models. Models that truly start to become world builders, that truly have understanding of the physical world. We're not there yet. I don't want people to get too excited, it's the beginning of it. But these devices are going to start to create these models of the world. They're going to start to understand our world so that we can engage with AI in totally new ways, in ways that are going to feel seamless. There is I think this evolution. I think a lot of people are not understanding what these devices can do when they're reading the physical world around us.Deidre Woollard: I think that's really fascinating because it makes me think of the difference that happened when we had mobile devices and all of a sudden you could see where everybody was, but you're just seeing that point, you're seeing a dot. Now you're seeing all of this information, and the computers are all processing and layering all that information. There seems like so many applications for that.Cathy Hackl: We're accessing that data layer. The data layer is, we can't see it as humans, but there's all this data around us. But once you have these devices that we can use to see through, glasses hopefully, like very nice glasses in the future, and they're reading the data that we can't really see, you start to access this new data layer. That's when I talk about virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world. That's where it starts to get interesting. You start to see all this data, not on your phone and a little pin, but actually in front of you in the way of an annotation, a hologram, or whatever it is that you're going to be accessing. Yeah, it starts to get really interesting really fast, and that's where compute power, processing power, where connectivity at levels we've never seen where edge, cloud, that's where it starts to get interesting when talking about spatial computing in the perspective of AI chips or cloud computing, all these sorts of things that need to be in place for us to be able to truly access that data layer in the physical world.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. It is. I'm just going so many places. You mentioned that you have children, I'm assuming youngish children, and I feel like for young people, their experience of the physical self and the virtual self is much different than for me growing up because they're growing up playing in Fortnite, in Roblox, and they're dressing their avatars, they're thinking about that. As we look to a spatial computing future, it seems like there's a a consciousness that exists in two places. Do you see that kind of thing happening?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. My three kids are all Generation Alpha, and I've been doing a lot of research and work on Generation Alpha. The kids of Millennials being born in 2010 and still being born. So Gen Alpha is in the process of growing up, let's say. I always say this, to them, what happens in the virtual space is equally real. My kids don't make a differentiation between the real world and the virtual world. It's just different parts of the world. It's a spectrum to them. I always say this, if they fight with a friend in Fortnite and they see them at school the next day, they're still going to be mad. [laughs] It doesn't change because it happened in Fortnite.It's still an interpersonal relationship. So these spaces are social spaces. They fluctuate between them, it doesn't make a difference for them. They just flow between them. It's very natural for them. Yeah, that is a difference I think for other mindsets, Millennials and up probably. It's harder for us to wrap our head around, but I see it with them day in and day out. That's when you start to think about special computing and gaming or even fashion. It unlocks a new world of self-expression, it unlocks new opportunities for them to socialize in new ways. For this younger generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha mostly, because Gen Alpha is really who's grown up with this being ubiquitous, it's truly changing the way they interact.Deidre Woollard: Well, I think the fashion question is interesting because I know you've invested in some virtual fashion. Now it's like Fortnite skins and things like that. But it seems like it could go in whole new places and really be valuable to people.Cathy Hackl: Yeah, I think it's about to unlock a new era for fashion and luxury and retail, in the sense that when you start to have a way for you to see fashion in new ways, where I'm going to be able to walk around and if you're wearing your glasses, you're going to be able to see the outfit I want you to see on me, or I might be able to change my outfit depending on if I'm going into this store right now or this office for this meeting. Maybe I'm meeting my friends for coffee, but then I'm going to have a job interview. Virtually, I might be able to change the way I look.I think that there's going to be some interesting things there. You already have, for example, London Fashion Week, a partnership they have with a company called SYKY, who, I'm a big fan of and I'm a holder of their NFT, and we can talk about NFTs for sure. But I'm a member of their community. I think they're starting to unlock fashion in a mixed-reality sense where there's a phygital, I don't like that word too much, but there's a physical expression of fashion and there's a virtual expression of fashion, and those expressions are starting to collide and get closer together.Definitely a lot of the conversations I'm having are with fashion brands that most of them are at the forefront of pushing these technologies. They've experimented with augmented reality in the AR try-ons for a long time and now they're like, ""What comes next? What does this mean?"" If this is already proving to be a way for us to create sales and create engagement with our community, what does this mean when you start to unlock this? Yeah, I think we're about to see fashion and technology coming closer together than they have ever been.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about NFTs as we wrap up because we had the NFT hype, we had the metaverse hype. Now I'm hearing maybe metaverse real estate suddenly is becoming valuable again. So you've been an integral part of all of these movements, now you're looking back on what came before and what is happening now. It feels to me like there's a way that what happened before sets up what happens now. But what are you seeing?Cathy Hackl: There was definitely obviously a lot of hype over a lot of these NFTs, speculative assets. Let's be honest, they were speculative assets. I mean, I got into a lot of these as a speculative asset. I'm not in most of them anymore, to be honest. I've divested myself from that. But I do think it did prime the market and the business world to understand that you can still own virtual things. That there is something that you could own virtually, it's in the code. I think it did change the mindset a little bit in that sense. It was overhyped and everything. When it comes to real estate, I don't know if I would go back and invest in some of the virtual real estate.I don't know if I would personally do that again. It looks interesting. It would have to be a really good value proposition for me to get back in there. We'll have to see. Where I think it starts to get really interesting in that perspective is virtual air rights, and stay with me here for a second. When everything you can see and everything you can hear becomes real estate, then that's where you start to figure out, OK, well, should people be able to own this?Should a company be able to own this? What I see and what I can hear, can they own the space around me? Can they own the space on top of my house? Can they own where I live in the virtual space? So I think that that's where you start to get really interesting conversations as far as who owns the virtual layer that is on top of the physical world that you're able to see through spatial computing. A lot of the conversations around virtual real estate that were had I think are going to be very valid when you start to think about virtual air rights. I can't remember which country it is right now.There's a country in the Caribbean that already has certain laws related to virtual air rights. You own the virtual air on top of your house up until a certain height. I think we're going to start to have these really, it keeps me up at night, doesn't keep most people up, it keeps me up at night because I really start to think about this becomes real estate. It's not just a floating billboard in Times Square that you're seeing, it starts to become everything around you. As I said, exciting for some things, a little nerve-wracking in other senses. So I think some of the conversations around virtual ownership start to become really relevant, and the role of blockchain when it comes to what you might be seeing and if it's real, if it's an authorized thing, it starts to seep into this conversation of the future spatial computing.Deidre Woollard: Wow. Well, thank you so much for your time today. This is so fascinating. Where can people keep up with you because you're going to a million places?Cathy Hackl: I am.

2024-03-05T18:05:29.000Z,"Apple’s iPhone sales plummet 24% in China, while Huawei’s skyrocket 64% as Chinese consumers abandon American tech","In China, consumers are opting to buy domestic products amid increasing tensions with the West, at least when it comes to their smartphones.Apple’s iPhone sales in the world's second largest economy, which are critical to its global revenues, nosedived 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research. But over that same period, China’s tech giant Huawei saw its sales surge 64%. Apple has struggled against “stiff competition” for high-end products from the “resurgent” Chinese competitor, Counterpoint’s senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said of the data in a statement.Since last summer, Huawei has benefitted from the release of its Mate 60 phone series after struggling to source parts for many months due to Western sanctions. The new phone features 47% Chinese-made parts, 18 percentage points higher than the previous model, and is even powered by a Chinese-manufactured chip. The Mate 60 amounts to a major upgrade for many Huawei users, but Apple’s iPhone 15 isn’t quite as enticing among its user base, according to Counterpoint’s Zhang.“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” she said.Increasing competition in the Chinese smartphone market is a big concern for Apple, given the company’s China iPhones sales hit $20.8 billion last year, a sizable chunk of their total phone sales of $69.7 billion. Apple’s Chinese smartphone market share also dropped to 15.7%, from 19% a year ago, making it the fourth most sold phone in China, compared to second in 2023.Apple’s stock took a hit on the news of its sales struggles on Tuesday, sinking over 2.5% by midday. Shares of the big tech giant are now down over 8% year to date after surging 46% in 2023. Weaker-than-forecast iPhone demand, a lack of AI development compared to other Big Tech competitors, the decision to abandon a decade-long bet on EVs, and a $2 billion fine from the European Commission that brought antitrust threats front and center are the main reasons for the weakness.Even Wedbush’s tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted that Wall Street’s fears about Apple’s prospects “resemble a horror show right now,” noting that Chinese smartphone demand is “very sluggish” at the moment.The veteran analyst remains bullish about Apple over the long term, however, due to “pent-up demand” for smartphone upgrades, which should lead to 270 million unit sales for the iPhone 16. Ives also believes Apple will begin to compete with its Big Tech rivals in the AI space after ditching its EV dreams.“Over the last decade we have been through many challenging periods in the Apple story and we handheld investors through these stormy periods just like today,” he wrote. “This is no different and in our view brighter days will be ahead for Apple although right now the China story remains the dark cloud over the name in the near-term.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphone-sales-plummet-24-180529063.html

2024-03-05T17:25:43.000Z,YTD Losers: 3 Tech Stock Laggards That Could Come Roaring Back,"Some stocks have been sitting on the sidelines amid this hot AI-driven market rally. Only time will tell when the market’s gains will broaden and help the year-to-date (YTD) losers; value-focused investors have a lot to love about the “left-behind” cohort. AI works its magic in more than just firms building AI models or GPUs powering them. In this piece, we’ll look at three mostly misunderstood tech stock laggards to buy,Far too many folks are quick to discount or dismiss AI plans entirely. Of course, nobody wants to play from behind when it comes to next-generation technologies, like generative AI. However, it’s much better to play late than not at all.Let’s check out three YTD tech losers I wouldn’t count out yet. Maybe, just maybe, one of them can be the tortoise that eventually overtakes the many hares in the tech scene!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock seems to be rolling down a steep hill at full speed, with shares plunging 7% on Monday’s flat-ish day for broader markets. Year to date, TSLA stock is down almost 25%. That’s a drastic decline in just north of two months. And while electric vehicles (EVs) are the hot tech trend of yesteryear, this sell-off could prove a buying opportunity for those with the pain tolerance to buy the dip.It’s hard to believe, but Tesla stock has shed around 54% of its peak value. As EV sales hit a speedbump, investors should keep their sights on the road ahead, not the rear-view mirror. The company is working hard on advancing its battery tech, self-driving capabilities and Tesla Dojo supercomputer.In the meantime, Dojo and its impressive AI talent alone make Tesla stock worth watching on the way down as other investors begin to view the firm as more of an auto play than an AI company.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was under some serious pressure on Monday, shedding around 3% of its value at the worst part of the trading day before closing off by 2.5%. Year to date, AAPL stock is down around 6%, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 10%.Undoubtedly, Apple got slapped with a stiff fine — close to $2 billion — from the European Union (EU) due to its music-streaming dominance. These anti-trust penalties come amid increased fear that Apple may be behind in the generative AI race.My take?Don’t discount the words of Apple’s legendary CEO, Tim Cook. Investors shouldn’t discount its potential if he’s hinting at generative AI tech on the horizon. Additionally, Apple quietly launched new Macbook Airs with the latest and greatest Apple Silicon: the M3 chip. The company calls it “the world’s best consumer laptop for AI.”Overlook the Macbook Air launch, but I think it’s the start of many AI-driven things for the year.At around $175 per share, Apple stock goes for around 27.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), a pretty reasonable multiple to pay for one of the planet’s most cherished consumer products companies (and underrated AI innovators).Even if Apple’s playing from behind, it’s still very much in the game.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software company with a less-than-ideal start to 2024, with shares down around 9% year to date. The company, which makes software products for developers, is innovating on the AI front to stay ahead in its corner of productivity software.Given the productivity-enhancing powers of generative AI, AI has become a must for Atlassian. Though AI could pave the way for rival firms, I’d argue Atlassian’s wide economic moat may not be so quick to narrow.From incorporating AI-generated summaries to offering a wide range of AI apps on its own marketplace, Atlassian has a world of upselling opportunities as it looks to showcase what AI has to offer at the workplace. The company aims to “accelerate work” with its suite of AI tools. And thus far, I’d say the firm’s done a great job of staying at the forefront of the AI revolution.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Dylan, thank you for having me.Dylan Lewis: We've got a double-stack short squeeze and the inside scoop on the world of hedge funds. But we're going to kick off today talking about a long-awaited car that it appears will never arrive. Asit, after almost a decade of speculation, Apple is apparently abandoning its vehicle efforts. Word out this week that the tech giant will be shifting employees working on its auto ambitions, code-named Project Titan, over to other projects, including those focused on artificial intelligence.Asit Sharma: This comes as little surprise, maybe to some, just because Apple has been working for so many years on this effort, it hasn't been able to come to fruition. So perhaps this writing was there on the wall. But before we get into maybe some of the implications of the not-so-great part of doing this investments for so many years. I just want to say that Apple has so much in terms of engineering talent on hand, so much on its balance sheet, so much time to innovate that it can do Skunk Works projects like this, that for any other business would be existential and just pull off, and that's maybe not necessarily a bad thing.Dylan Lewis: This truly was a Skunk Works project. I'm glad you drop that word there because so much of our understanding of what this project was and even what Apple's ambitions were when it came to the cars, really came by way of following permits, following patents, following acquisitions the company had made and sources that reporters had that were willing to spill a little bit about what was going on. The company itself did not give very much on what was happening behind the scenes and what it was trying to do in automotive, which even in trying to process this information makes it a little hard. Because I think we'd wondered for a while, does the automotive ambitions here mean hardware in the conventional sense? Or is there something else at play, even knowing they're going to be diverting some resources away from that, we're still not really sure.Asit Sharma: I agree. I think most of us thought at the end of the day that Apple was trying to find the next great delivery vehicle, no pun intended, [laughs] or pun intended, for its software services. The car would be a place where you would have access to all of Apple's great software. So in terms of what this was, well, it was R&D, research and development. So much of the time we think of research and development is being innovation or improving products. But it's also tinkering. It's trying to figure out what could be the next thing that gives us access to this wide, wide path of revenue. For Apple, there were some limitations here in that they were trying to develop something in an industry which itself was undergoing so much change. We still don't know today from a consumer perspective, if we want to drive EVs. From an industry perspective, if it should be conventional vehicles, EVs, or hybrid vehicles, are we going autonomous or not? Apple was trying to build a car during a time in which no one really understands what the future is going to be like out on the road and this made it doubly hard. Throw in the idea of maybe having an AI-enriched product that would be superior to anyone else's software where you have Tesla, which has been building a supercomputer and grabbing data from its cars on the roads for many, many years. Trying to compete with this type of technology itself is just another Skunk Works project, I think at the end of the day, Apple called a really good play, which is to exit and say, look, we've got some learning here. We can transfer this to other parts of the business. But this is the best place for us to capitalize on our strengths and because they're so big and so successful, really not going to hurt them. At the end of the day, they'll shuffle some good people around and move on to the next great idea.Dylan Lewis: I think I follow you on that take there, Asit. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if some of the work, some of the investment, the research and development that went into this project winds up showing up somewhere at some point, just maybe not in the way that we would have expected. I was always a little skeptical that it was going to be cars as hardware and felt like we were going to see something more in the software lane. It's not out of the realm of possibility that some of the work that was done here winds up showing up in cars at some point, just maybe in a way we haven't quite thought of before.Asit Sharma: I agree, and in the requests to other parts of the company, when you're in a unit like this, which is out there on your own developing a technology. There is a lot of intellectual reach that goes on. So you request of the chip team, could we design a chip that would do X? You requested the AI team, if I had to train this neural network to take a left turn suddenly here, how would we do this? Not having that technology in-house. So all of these requests that the unit would give to other parts of the company can be expanded upon and put to other uses. So I don't think all of this is wasted effort. Did they lose a lot of time? Sure, Dylan. I can remember, you probably don't, like seven or eight years ago when I was a writer for Motley Fool and you were an editor, you asked me to do a small report on the then-Project Titan, I don't even know if it was called that again. This is how old it is, two or three positions ago, almost a decade ago, I remember you asked me about this. So yeah, it's something that only a few companies around can afford to spend more than 10 years on. But I do think that's still before I move on to the next topic, maybe comes back to that ever-present existential question for Apple, what next after the iPhone and it's not going to be cars, clearly.Dylan Lewis: We're still waiting for Apple's next chapter, it turns out. From cutting-edge tech over to cutting-edge food, shares of Beyond Meat, the plant-based protein maker up huge today and it followed earnings, Asit. But if you look at the earnings results on the surface, not all that impressive. Sales down 8%, company continued to log huge losses. But I think as we tape, shares up 40% and that is due in large part it seems, to the shorts out there that have interest in this company.Asit Sharma: Certainly, Dylan. When I looked this morning, I was surprised to see how high that short interest is, it's something like 38% of shares outstanding are now sold short and it's going to take several days to cover those shares. I think the days to cover is something like eight days. So that shows that there is a phenomenal amount of short pressure there. And perhaps any small good news would cause a reaction like this. The interesting thing, looking at the trail of this short interest is people being negative on Beyond Meat for a while. I went to a free site that shows data for a couple of years and for the last two years, on any given day, the short interest has been 40%-plus. It looks like some short-sellers have ridden this successfully down all the way from, I think like $26 a share down to the previous day's close, let's let's put it that way. So it's been a decent trade if you're a short-seller for a long time and maybe some people got lulled into thinking this just keeps going on until the stock goes to zero.Dylan Lewis: Yeah. I look at Beyond and I say this is clearly a company that has struggled. I think their losses were twice their top line or their operating losses were about twice their top line. So this was a business that was having a very hard time finding its footing, finding the correct pricing for consumers out in the marketplace. I think in reality, I probably agree with a lot of the points that would be in a short thesis for this company. That said, you mentioned, it doesn't take much for a company like this to turn things around or to rise a bit when there's such high short interest in the earnings report that we saw from this business, management said we're expecting gross margins in the mid-teens for 2024. Right now, gross margin's negative 20% in 2023. So that was the news that sent this company flying. I look at short interest in general and when you see mounting bets against the business like this, I have to say over the last couple of years, we have seen this go the wrong way in very high-profile ways for so many investors. I continue to be amazed that investors can be so greedy piling into something that's so heavily shorted.Asit Sharma: I totally agree. The people who are short as of yesterday, I think they're in two camps. One, they know exactly what they're doing. No. 2, they don't know anything about what's they're doing. [laughs] So the first camp is taking a risk. The shares are now down to $6, that this is going to zero. They have an idea that Beyond Meat made a fundamental misreading of the market and the shelf space that they could acquire globally, and that's been their problem. You cite the negative margins and they believe that there's no way this can be turned around. The other camp is following the herd getting in because the narrative's so bad. But just looking at your point here, Dylan, the balance sheet, while it's not great, has shown some improvement in one important area over the last year, inventory has gone down from $236 million to $130 million. When you combine that with what is going on in the statement of cash flows, a cash burn that went from $320 million in operating cash to a burn of $108 million in 2023 year over year. There are some signs there that maybe if gross margin went positive and costs were cut drastically, this company could stick around for a few years. So why do we have short interest still at 38%? It comes back to, I think a key word you just uttered, greedy. There's some greed going on here that's getting punished today.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, and for what it's worth, there are some other big names out there with pretty high short interest getting above that 30% range. You look out there, Novavax, Trupanion, Upstart, Carvana, C3.ai, Lemonade, Plug Power. I'm not making a judgment on whether those are quality businesses, but I do think if you're seeing it creep up like that, that is a sign that it won't take very much for you to go upside down on your short bet.Asit Sharma: I agree. So if you're going to be part of that 30% plus, I beg you, people, read the narrative but also look at the numbers. Just make sure that an unexpected piece of good news doesn't cause you to raise to cover and maybe face a window of eight days to get there.Dylan Lewis: All right, Asit. That story with Beyond was earnings adjacent. We're going to wrap our news rundown with a true focus on company results. Coupang, the leading South Korean e-commerce company, reported this week, shares up 5% after the company posted its best sales growth since 2021. What's driving the company forward?Asit Sharma: Dylan, the company is really benefiting from the investments that it made in its pre-IPO phase when they were fueled by crazy money by a number of investors, so they were able to invest billions into infrastructure in South Korea, which we've talked about on this show, has a really interesting topography. The geography of South Korea is very interesting, so it's really hard to build a logistics business. They went there, they raised some public money, built out a logistics and fulfillment arm, and now between their delivery service, services like Coupang Eats food delivery, and a service which lets small merchants operate like third-party sellers on their platform, much in the way that the Amazons and Shopifys of the world do here in North America, they were really starting to get some traction. Net revenues were up 23% year over year to $6.5 billion in the last three months, and the company made a profit of a billion bucks on that. So we're starting to see some traction in this model. It's not quite optimized yet, and I do think that growth might be lumpy and hit some challenges, but at least the narrative that Bom Kim, who is a really great entrepreneur, brought to the market is starting to play out. Plus, they're expanding into Taiwan, which gives some of the bears on Coupang, some food for thought. This was always seen as a one-shot play in the e-commerce market of South Korea. Coupang's actually retraced a bit from some other geographies has tried to expand into, but it is starting to see a little bit of success in Taiwan, which itself has a great market, so maybe there's a silver lining there for revenue. I really like these numbers, I think that the company has mastered this hard logistics delivery equation in South Korea. They do it profitably and they are investing in some other areas of the business, those are losing money right now. It's just some small bets on things like fintech, but they represent growth areas. Last I wanted to say just in summary here I like that the total active customer count is still rising. It was up in the mid-teens, again, trying to saturate that South Korean market where they've sort of eclipsed competitors. Now, it's their mission to get as much of that market as they can. You do that by growing customers and making sure they're spending a little bit more, which the average spends per active customer is also up about 6%. So just a well-rounded report, and I think the stock is performing accordingly today and probably should be a decent, interesting company for people to research in the coming years, those who are looking for a retail story.Dylan Lewis: Asit, you mentioned the international expansion for them and looking to get into other markets. One of the other ways this company has been looking to grow is through its acquisition of Farfetch, which is more on the luxury side of apparel and retail. They spent around $500 million for that acquisition, and I think at the time it was kind of controversial in terms of its strategic fit and its use of capital. I'm curious, do you feel like we're in a position where we can grade that yet or are we still waiting to really see how that shows up?Asit Sharma: Yeah. I think we are OK to wait. Actually, Bom Kim, the CEO said, look, we just bought Farfetch. We did this because it has $4 billion dollars in gross merchandise volume passing through its platform every year, and that's really what we're after. But he also said it's really too early to talk about it. We think it's going to be a great decision, but we're still looking on how to capitalize this, and I think investors can spot Coupang some time here because their strength is distribution, they've proven that. This was one of the problems with Farfetch. While it really brought a lot of small luxury players together in the market, it could never solve the problem of how to give them the tools for them to sell to a wide audience, and then make money at the same time from the take on the platform, the fees that were charged. Coupang is really good at this, that's a strength of theirs. They just haven't done it in high-fashion mode, like a luxury type of distribution model. So I think letting them tinker around and figure this out is fine, as long as the rest of the business is really firing away as we just walked through and generating a lot of free cash flow, a lot of profits. I'm willing to wait a few quarters to see what they can do with Farfetch.Dylan Lewis: All right. Asit Sharma, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Thanks so much, Dylan. I had a lot of fun.Dylan Lewis: Coming up. Hedge funds control over $5 trillion dollars in assets. What's it like to work for one? Up next, Deidre Woollard talks to Carrie Sun, author of the new memoir, Private Equity, for a look into the power, pain, and privilege in the world of hedge funds. Just a programming note, some of the answers have been trimmed for length and clarity. Enjoy.Deidre Woollard: Well, there's such a mystique around the world that these funds, but in the beginning of the book, you point out that while the average stock hedge fund beat the S&P total return by over 5% in the years 1990-2009, it's been a different story since then. BDS talked about that a lot, but there's still so much money, billions of dollars flowing to these funds. So what is some of the allure of that world?Carrie Sun: I just think the thrill of the possibility of extremely high returns to outperform the market is just so not only is it so American, but I think it gives people so much hope for the future, and I think that possibility itself of just beating the market is just so alluring to many people. As you mentioned, in the last decade and certainly during the 2010s, bull market hedge funds have broadly underperformed routinely. I think that thrill of possibly picking a winning hedge fund and sticking with them through years and compounding those returns is just so exciting for a lot of people. I think also by investing in hedge funds, I think people are investing in a certain type of exclusive access. By that I mean, so if you're investing in hedge funds as an asset class, you are investing in their ability to get themselves in front of company management, CEOs, CFOs, fighting for these corporate meetings that provide more information than say, in financial statements. So you're getting access to the ultimate companies you're investing in. But also many of these funds have investor days, LP conferences, and just to be on the inside to be an LP. Some of these very exclusive high-performing hedge funds that itself is such an elite exclusive clubs such that if you're at an investor day at one of these top exclusive hedge funds, you can meet not only people who hold and invest your money, but you can meet other LPs and just get a lot of connections and access that way. So I think for hedge funds itself, there's the promise of extremely high returns which still happens today. Even though historically, recently, they have been lagging the market. But just also to be a part of this very exciting, secretive club.Deidre Woollard: It's interesting in the book 'cause you go from the analyst side at Fidelity and then you take a break and you go into private equity, so to adjacent, but it seems very separate world. So what really surprised you about that shift?Carrie Sun: It was totally different, and when I was working on the analyst side, I wasn't investment side working in quantitative equities at Fidelity Investments. So and then I worked in the private equity, private funds, hedge fund side for my billionaire boss who is the founder of this large firm. I was more in a support role, but I also definitely did a lot of research for him, and I provided both administrative but also operational and research leverage to him. I think what surprised me was less so much going from the investment side to a support role, but rather just the whole industry going from quantitative investing to more fundamentally driven investing. The difference was just so stark. So at my former job, quantitative in nature, I just sat in front of my computer and I was coding all day. I was analyzing datasets, pulling datasets, cleaning them, trying to get them to work in order to build multifactor models from them for stock selection. It was sitting at my desk, analyzing data, doing a lot of coding, reading research papers, trying to find new factors that might work in quantitative and investing. I could go a week without talking to anybody except my boss for maybe 15 minutes, 30 minutes to just catch up on the work I did throughout the week. In the private equity side, I learned it was much more of a human and high-touch storytelling aspect to investing. That is to say that my phone rang every five minutes. I was also answering the phone on behalf of my boss. But also many people just called me to try to strategize how to get to my boss. So my phone was ringing all the time. I was talking to people all the time and yeah, I was having hundreds of little conversations every day and there's this line in my book about my boss saying he got 7,000 emails a day, and this is in the 2010s.On the quantitative side, my phone pretty much didn't ring. I was dealing with numbers, I was dealing less with people. So I think what that is also showing is that on the quantitative side, the decisions were mostly made. I would say what we were doing was more quantamental, which is a mix of quantitative and fundamental. But the decisions were made mostly by the computer, sometimes with human discretion to override some of those decisions. But ultimately, at the end of the day, there was no sense of urgency to a lot of the investment decisions that were being made. But then on the fundamental side, at the hedge fund, everything was urgent because news happens and then if news happens, you have to update your models for your investments. This was especially urgent during earnings season, for example. You were just always on the clock responding to news. So everything was urgent every minute of every day versus a more, at Fidelity, I really worked 9-5 sometimes six, five days a week. Of course, after that though, overnight, I was letting my models run and I was doing back-tests and simulations. But I really just sat on my desk and did coding for much of the day there. It was a lot more, the pace was just less everything is a fire and urgent and needed to be responded to instantly. So that was the biggest change from moving from one place to another.Deidre Woollard: The pace that you described in the book is certainly, it's brutal. It's hard because part of what you're talking about is access and information. You've got this great line in the book that I love about asymmetric knowledge being asymmetric power. So for the fund that you talk about in the book, so much of that is knowing things ahead of the news cycle. I'm wondering, even in the past decade since your experience, it seems like maybe there's a little more, everything becomes widely known. I don't know if you think that the value of that information has shifted to some extent.Carrie Sun: That's a great question because I think that yes, in general, I'm happy about the democratization of knowledge and financial knowledge and data itself. What I mean by that line, asymmetric knowledge is asymmetric power is, I think, certainly, these massive investment funds, they have ways of getting information and I'll say it's sometimes that can have a certain connotation, but I'll say there are interesting ways to get legal information before all other people. It's all about information, advantage, an edge. So like you say, even though I think the line has been moving about what information is easily obtainable versus more difficult to get, I think what many of these massive funds tried to do is it doesn't matter where the line is. They're going to try to just get right up to the line and get before it. So it really just doesn't matter, the line will and has been moving. But they will always try to be one step ahead of it. I think it's not even just purely in terms of information, but even in processes are ways to get information. I'll give you one tiny example and these examples I think accrue in just the ways you're able to get information. But when I started work at this fund that I write about in my book. So many people there, so I was born in China. I speak Mandarin and I got to the firm and so many people there spoke fluent Mandarin. Just from the looks, they were not of Chinese ancestry or descent. That might seem like a small thing. But if you're in these investor meetings and if you're in these if you're trying to do your due diligence on a company and meeting with management, being able to just have that rapport in a native language could be really helpful. They were, I think, really early to that, such that the people there were more fluent than I was and also reading Chinese.Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

2024-03-05T18:27:44.000Z,"UPDATE 3-US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa","(Adds editing attribution)By Jonathan StempelMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show. None was named as a defendant.The case is Doe 1 et al v Apple Inc et al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-7135.

The company has the lowest ratio of buy ratings to holds and sells since 2020.Read More: Apple’s iPhone Struggles in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge“Forget the car, what matters most for this stock is the AI strategy launch,” Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote in a note dated March 4. “To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone.”While Apple’s move away from EVs has been broadly welcomed, analysts are looking for the company to release its own generative AI product. Samsung Electronics Co.’s updated Galaxy line of smartphones can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.“Samsung has a generative AI phone right now and is getting a lot of positive buzz about it, and Apple doesn’t yet,” noted Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “Apple doesn’t have some of the current momentum drivers and so it’s lagging a bit, so I think it’ll be a second half story if some of these new products actually get out the door.”Still, for bulls, the company’s potential to capture public imagination with an AI enhancement means that investors should be patient. Melius analysts see new AI services driving users to upgrade their iPhones, kicking off a “supercycle” in 2025.“It’s time for a deep breath,” wrote Melius’s Reitzes, noting that 99% of Apple’s installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices “are never going to switch to Android — so a ‘comeback’ is likely.”And, long-time investors say that being a late mover is nothing new for Apple. Counting them out in the early innings of the AI cycle would be a mistake, according to Robert Conzo, CEO and managing director at The Wealth Alliance LLC.“Apple’s doing what Apple does best — it kind of waits, sits back and then sees how it’s going to position its products to take advantage of the AI craze,” he said.Tech Chart of the DayApple Inc. has erased more than $300 billion in market value since its shares closed at a record in December and has entered a technical correction for the first time since August.

2024-03-05T16:55:49.000Z,What the shakeup in Magnificent 7 stocks means for markets,"Stock market indices have been propped up on the success of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks up until late. As market gains begin to slow, is the aptly named tech stock group likely to become a set of laggards rather a catalyst?BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician Jonathan Krinsky speaks on the bifurcation now evident, namely in Magnificent Seven components like Apple (AAPL).""The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014. So when they ended, neither of them marked any sort of major top,"" Krinsky tells Yahoo Finance. ""We're certainly overdue for maybe a bit of a shakeout. And then within the Nasdaq 100, we are starting to see some dispersion and bifurcation... where last year was pretty much a uniform move higher for the Magnificent Seven. We've now started to see that breakdown...""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]- A rally in big tech has driven the market to record levels, pushing the S&P and the NASDAQ to recent all time highs. But it's not strength that we're seeing here across the board. Some cracks are starting to form in the Magnificent Seven trade. Invesco's QQQ, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 is up just over 8% since the start of the year. Now, compare that to the underperformance that we've seen in Apple stock, which is off here in negative territory since the start of the year.Here to tell us what that might signal ahead, we want to bring in Jonathan Krinsky. He is BTIG's Managing Director and Chief Market Technician. Jonathan, it's great to have you here. So what does this signal? Some sort of shakeout coming. And what do you think that could potentially look like?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So if we take a step back and look at the big picture, obviously, it's been an amazing rally for the NASDAQ in general. We've now gone actually over 300 trading days, consecutive trading days without a down 2.5% day on the NASDAQ 100. That's the third longest streak since 1990.And so you could say that's a bit of complacency. You know, now, on the one hand, it is something you see in strong bull markets. The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014. So when they ended, neither of them marked any sort of major top. But I think the point is that we're certainly overdue for maybe a bit of a shakeout.And then within the NASDAQ 100, we are starting to see some dispersion and bifurcation whereas last year was pretty much a uniform move higher for the Magnificent Seven. We've now started to see that break down. Obviously, Tesla has been the weakest link. But Apple, as you mentioned, down about 10% on the year. And recently, Alphabet or Google has started to roll over and break below its 200-day.So there's some dispersion going on. And then the last point we'd make is, what we noted yesterday to clients was a pretty rare setup in the sense that Apple-- the daily RSI was below 30 yesterday for Apple while the daily RSI for the NASDAQ 100 was above 65. We've actually never seen that since the inception of the QETF in 1999. The closest analog we have was back in late January 2018 when Apple's RSI got below 35 and the Q's RSI was still above 65.That saw Apple have about a 8% drawdown while the Q's-- QQQ was hitting new highs into the end of January. And then that led to that period known as Volmageddon in early February of 2018.- Yeah. I actually used to sit directly across from the office of Jonathan Jacobs, who came up with the NASDAQ 100, which led to the QQQs, of course. And is exactly what you're referencing there. It's really interesting here. One of the things that you put in your note, there have been lots of signals over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either August 2020, tech will blow off or 2018's Volmageddon. What is the largest signal that investors should be paying close attention to right now?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Well, yeah. Again, I mean, you there's been things such as the volatility index has been rising a bit or holding firm with a rising market. That typically signals some sort of inflection point. Again, we mentioned the Apple signal. It's interesting. Breadth has actually been broadening. We've seen a new high for the Russell 2000. We've seen areas like materials and energy and even REITs start to actually act better. So on the one hand, breadth is broadening, which, I think, is encouraging.And that's something that investors have been waiting for a while, especially after last year was so dominant and not broad. So on the one hand, that is a good sign, on the other hand, if you look at some of the momentum indices or momentum strategies where it's simply buying stocks that have been going up, and generally, we are proponents of buying momentum.But when it gets to an extreme and buying just begets momentum and you get some of these very extreme readings we've been getting, that's when it gets a little bit concerning. Some of the AI semiconductor stocks certainly are exhibiting that. You could even look at some retailers like e.l.f. Beauty or Abercrombie that have just been kind of one way to the upside. So at some point, the rubber band does stretch too far. And I think we're kind of at that point for some of these names.- Jonathan, is this more indicative of more of a short term pullback rather than a top that could be forming over the longer term?JONATHAN KRINSKY: I think so. I mean, if you think about the fact that we just-- earlier this year or late last year broke above that 4,800 level for the S&P 500, that was 2 years in the making. So typically, if you go two years without any progress, you break out from it, you're not talking about a major top at that point.So maybe we do get a pullback and retest that 4,800 level on the S&P, which would probably be an attractive entry point. But yeah. I don't think we're talking about some sort of major top. Obviously, could be wrong there. But again, that broadening of breadth would argue against that. I think it's more just the near-term extended nature in some of the isolated pockets of the market.- Jonathan Krinsky-- BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician. Thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Appreciate it.JONATHAN KRINSKY: Thank you.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/shakeup-magnificent-7-stocks-means-165549896.html

2024-03-13T16:09:53.000Z,Corporate dividends reach $1.66T in 2023: Report,"A report from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index revealed that global corporate dividends reached an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023. Notably, 86% of businesses worldwide increased or maintained their dividend payouts during the year— with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) being the world's top three dividend payers.Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills and Seana Smith break down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithMADISON MILLS: We're also going to talk about dividends because global corporate dividends hit a new high of $1.66 trillion last year, with banks making up half of that. Worldwide, 86% of listed companies either increased or maintained their dividends. That's all according to a quarterly report done by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.And it's just really interesting seeing this new record of $1.72 trillion in dividend payouts this year. This was such a big deal that it contributed to the jobs report. We saw that personal income.At least 4 percentage points of that was attributed to the rise in dividends. So it paints to this broader picture of how we're continuing to see a correlation between market performance and the strength that we're seeing in consumer spending in the overall economy.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. The strong, healthy corporate balance sheets really here front and center, and that's a big driver of the dividend action that we have seen. You mentioned, Maddie, what we were seeing globally, even here within the US. Very impressive numbers.$602.1 billion in total was handed back to shareholders last year through dividends. That was up 5%. Microsoft in the top spot here, the largest dividend payer last year, handing out more than $20 billion in cash to shareholders, followed closely by Apple. Apple was in the number two spot.But you're talking about what lies ahead here for 2024. And like you were saying, $1.72 trillion on a global basis is expected to be paid out, another 5% jump. So that also is very similar to some of the calls that we have gotten from others on the Street.S&P Global was also out predicting another record level of dividend growth in 2024 when they're looking for another 4% increase globally, 6% here within the US. So this is a trend that has been talked about over the last several quarters. But it's certainly something that we called out in this most recent quarter as a trend that we have heard many of these companies that not only are paying dividends, but also raising the amount that they are paying to shareholders. So it looks like, at least if these forecasts are right, we could be set up for another record year ahead.MADISON MILLS: Yeah. I remember being on with you a couple of months ago and you booking a guest who talked about the importance of getting in on dividend plays because at least, it's a guarantee of cash. And that's kind of a hedge against any of the macro concerns. It's also interesting looking at some of those big tech names that you mentioned.I'm fascinated that Meta isn't even in the top couple there because just Mark Zuckerberg alone is expected to make $700 million in dividends due to that dividend increase from Meta this year. So not a bad-- not a bad year of returns there.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

""Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.""In response to requests for comment, Apple referred to its Jan. 16 notice, where it said the injunction would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem,"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride on its platform.Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing.Last week, Apple briefly escalated the feud by blocking Epic from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe, before backing down two days later.In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law. The court also decided against hearing Apple's own appeal from the injunction.The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.

2024-03-13T16:00:00.000Z,4 Things Many Investors Might Not Know About Arm Holdings -- Including Certain Nvidia and Apple Ties,"Last month, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) stock rocketed 48% on the day following the chip designer's release of a strong report for its  third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Dec. 31, 2023. Management cited artificial intelligence (AI) as a main growth driver.No doubt, the mention of AI and the stock's huge price movement brought more investor attention to the U.K.-based company, which seemed to have previously been flying under the radar of many individual investors. That's likely due in part to Arm being new to the public markets -- it held its initial public offering (IPO) last September. So even many investors who closely follow the semiconductor market are probably not nearly as familiar with Arm as they are with other big chip companies.Below are four things you might not know about Arm Holdings, whose primary business is licensing its intellectual property (IP) related to the design of central processing unit (CPU) chips.Arm was founded in 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines, which was a joint venture between the now defunct Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology (some parts of which are now part of NXP Semiconductors).RISC stands for ""reduced instruction set computer,"" which Arm defines as a ""type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly optimized set of instructions rather than the highly specialized set of instructions typically found in other architectures."" The company touts that RISC is ""often considered the most efficient CPU architecture technology available today.""Arm's energy-efficient CPU architecture is widely considered one of the key drivers of the smartphone revolution, as these mobile devices need processors that don't consume a lot of power.While Apple's first iPhone, launched in 2007, wasn't the world's first smartphone -- or cellphone that had internet access -- it played a huge part in kicking off the smartphone revolution. This phone had an Arm-based processor.Currently, more than 99% of smartphones use Arm-based processors, according to the company.Arm's board of directors includes Tony Fadell. He led the team at Apple ""that created the first 18 generations of the iPod and the first three generations of the iPhone,"" according to his profile on Arm's website. Beyond leading this group, Fadell is widely credited as inventing the iPod music player.Moreover, he is a founder and former CEO of Nest, the maker of smart-home gadgets, which Alphabet -- whose corporate name was then Google -- acquired in 2014.The answer is ""yes"" if you're wondering if at least the first and early iPods had Arm-based processors. And according to various sources detailing teardowns of Nest thermostats, they also use Arm's tech. Indeed, Arm's tech is ubiquitous in smart gadgets from TVs to watches.Fadell's background is a great fit for Arm's board, which also includes others with very relevant experience, including former executives at major semiconductor companies Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm. And in Qualcomm's case, it's a former CEO, Paul Jacobs.Investors who have been following Nvidia for some time probably know that the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker tried to acquire Arm, but abandoned the pending deal in early 2022 after running into significant regulatory hurdles.However, it's not likely many investors are aware that Arm CEO Rene Haas spent seven years at Nvidia as vice president and general manager of its computing products business before joining Arm in 2013. Haas was elevated to Arm's CEO position in 2022 following the failed Nvidia deal.While Arm's global headquarters is in Cambridge, England, Haas is based out of the company's U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley. This makes good sense since the bulk of the world's largest tech companies are in this region.The fact that Nvidia was interested in buying Arm makes Arm stock worth at least watching. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is as brainy and business shrewd as they come.Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-13T15:02:45.000Z,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.Apple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.Also Read:  Top 5 Energy Stocks You May Want To Dump In MarchPhoto: ABCDstock/Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-03-13T14:21:00.000Z,Has the Sun Set on Apple's Innovation-Driven Stock?,"Once one of the strongest-growing businesses of the 21st century, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can no longer claim the title of the world's most valuable company. While second place hardly constitutes a fall from grace, investors may be wondering what the tech titan's path forward will be. In the past, Apple's annual release cycle consistently offered either new devices or significant improvements to existing products. Today, it's quite difficult to tell a 2019 Mac apart from a 2023 Mac, and even the last five iPhones have not seen any major design changes.While some product launches provided more growth than others for Apple, the general philosophy under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and design chief Jony Ive always aimed to improve the brand's perception. During Ive's 27-year career in Apple's design department, the company went from large plastic casings to precision machine aluminum. In the five years since his departure, Macbooks and iPhones alike have gotten thicker, heavier, and larger than ever before.There are now two questions to consider before investing in Apple:Has design stagnation led to apathy among consumers who once waited in line for hours to buy its newest products?Can Apple's new foray into spatial computing help the company get back to its old self, or will it become just another contender in the space?Fiscal 2023 -- which ended Sept. 30, 2023 -- saw Apple's sales markedly decrease across many products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. For each of the different devices, lower sales stemmed from unique factors. In other words, it wasn't simply a result of tightening economic conditions reducing consumer spending.For the iPhone, despite the release of the iPhone 15 models, many consumers saw very little reason to upgrade. The new phones replaced Apple's longtime Lightning connector with USB-C and added slight processing and camera improvements. The premium versions received titanium bodies. This marked the seventh year in a row in which the phone's features and form factor changed incrementally, even though the new models' prices increased.In the case of the Mac, processor upgrades did little to drive interest, and unit sales dropped by 11%. This is likely because the new Macbooks are functionally indistinguishable from the previous two years' models. Base models also still cannot support more than one monitor, which significantly limits users who need multiple screens for productivity. This has been an issue since Macbooks switched away from Intel CPUs to Apple's M-series chips.As for the iPad, 2023 marked the first year since that product's debut in which Apple did not release a new model. The result? A 15% decrease in unit sales from 2022 and insufficient marketing for the product line.Initially, Apple's business model focused on offering only the newest version of a product and discontinuing older iterations to avoid price cuts. This also meant the company could cut costs on supporting older models by decreasing the number in circulation. As of the release of the iPhone 14 series in 2022, however, Apple began offering the 13 and 12 as more affordable alternatives to the newest model. This continued in 2023 with the launch of the 15 series, with the 14 and 13 becoming the less expensive variants.Apple has also been branding even more affordable products as ""SE,"" beginning with with the iPhone SE in 2016 and followed by the Apple Watch SE four years later. With significantly more models of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, the company created its product ladder. Consumers now walk into an Apple Store expecting to buy an older model for a cheaper price but are then walked up the product ladder by seeing the incremental price and feature increases.This ultimately leads consumers to that ""Why not?"" moment, where they wonder if the $100 saved is worth having to settle for inferior features.Apple applied this strategy across most of the company's product sales and kept revenue steadily rising from 2019 to 2022 until last year's 2.8% decline.Though Apple has struggled to innovate on existing products, the launch of the new Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024 marks the company's foray into the augmented reality market. While Apple doesn't call the Vision Pro augmented reality, opting instead for ""spatial computing,"" it has a long way to go before becoming competitive in the headset market.Priced at a staggering $3,500, the headset is far out of reach for most consumers, but this is likely part of the company's ladder strategy. By introducing the Vision Pro at a high price, Apple opens up a timeline where it can release new versions, either as SE or legacy models, and slowly bring down the price over time. Whether this new product line will revolutionize personal computing and revive Apple's business growth remains to be seen.Despite revenue slipping in 2023, Apple shares rose 48% last year and nearly doubled the S&P 500's return. Unfortunately, the company's recent announcements regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been greeted with a mixed reception from investors, with some expressing low confidence in the venture.Moreover, though Apple's second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales is its software services like the App Store and Apple Music, even this golden egg isn't safe. As antitrust pressure mounts regarding the App Store and its 30% royalties for app developers, the EU Commission's $2 billion fine brings the company's longtime App Store practices into question.Now might not be the best time to buy Apple shares. I'd wait until the company's new projects in augmented reality and AI mature. Yet those currently holding Apple have no pressing reason to sell the stock, even as hardware revenue slows, because software sales can help pick up the slack. I think investors should keep a watchful eye as Apple continues to transition its business model from leaning solely on hardware products to software services and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-12T20:02:24.000Z,Bank of America boosts S&P 500 earnings outlook on AI drivers,"Bank of America has raised its EPS (earnings per share) outlook for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to $250 in 2024. Yahoo Finance Live comments on BofA's new earnings forecasts and the role AI and Magnificent Seven tech stocks have played in pushing the S&P higher.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.- Time now to dig a little deeper into some analyst calls of the day, starting with Bank of America raising its 2024 earnings per share. That's EPS target for the S&P 500. Citing a virtuous cycle in AI investment paired with a new labor productivity, they raised their EPS target by 12% for the year end to $250. And Julie, they are now a Street high. And they're touting that in their own report. They're happy to be there. I would say Savita Subramanian and the other teams there, they've been ahead of the pack. They were quite right last year early on when a lot of other analysts were negative. But they've come around, and now this earnings per share that puts them at $250 for this year, $275 for next.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And I think it's so interesting that AI has gone from being a specific company story, or even a sector story to really more of a macro story. Right? I mean, because they talk about that quote unquote, ""virtuous investment cycle."" They talk about new economy investing as the old economy cuts back. And this is according to Bank of America a flip of last year when we saw the so-called hyperscalers, the companies like Microsoft and Amazon and Alphabet, that were cutting back while the rest of the S&P 500 was investing. Now you've seen a flip of that situation. But obviously, the team over there sees this as enough to boost that EPS number.- Well, and for all the talk about share buybacks and dividends, we can also-- investors can also get a return on their capital through capital investments or capital expenditures. And this is-- here's another line from the report. Hyperscalers, this includes Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, expected to spend $180 billion on capital expenditures this year. That's up 27%.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.- So just an amazingly high number that's going into the future basically.JULIE HYMAN: And then on the old economy side just one more quick note, they also say they see a manufacturing upgrade and perhaps a restocking cycle. Right? Because you had over inventory.- We've been in a manufacturing recession.JULIE HYMAN: Right. And then you just had an inventory correction, and now I guess the correction to the correction would be that restocking taking place.- Correction to the correction is up, guys.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.[CHUCKLES]Exactly.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/bank-america-boosts-p-500-200224272.html
2024-03-12T15:24:07.000Z,Apple's stock is in the red for 2024: What the charts show,"Apple (AAPL) has lost more than $300 billion in market cap so far in 2024. It's one of the three Magnificent Seven laggards, a list that also includes Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The company hasn't been able to capitalize on AI the way other group members have and there are growing concerns about iPhone sales in China.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre takes a closer look at Apple's charts to see what may lie ahead for the stock.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: The Magnificent Seven in focus this week as we see multiple members trading in the red. AI darling NVIDIA has logged two straight days of losses. Overall, still outperforming, though. And it's up here over the past five days by about 5%, and year-to-date, you're seeing it up as well. But three of the seven Mag Seven stocks are not outperforming. Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla all seeing losses since the start of 2024. Shares of Apple off 10%. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi there. I thought this heat map here of our megacaps kind of encapsulates what we've seen this year. Apple in the red while most of the other things in the green, and Tesla down 1%. And let me show the year-to-date totals where you can see, as you just said, Apple down 10%, Tesla down 29%. Of the Mag Seven, it is the worst off. But then there's Nvidia up 80% really just outshining them all.And here's another way of looking at it. If we look at the market cap gains this year, Nvidia up almost a cool trillion dollars. It was closer to that mark a couple of days ago, but it is roaring back to it. Then you have Meta, Amazon each up more than $200 billion. Microsoft, too, thrown in that category. Then you start getting into the underperformers.Alphabet just slightly down. Tesla, although it's worse down percentagewise, only down the second worst down $224 billion. And then Apple down $327 billion. And I'll do some technical analysis on Apple chart because it is just getting back to a really interesting area. Let me put a three-month chart on. And actually, let me put a one-year chart on. And we can see what could be an M top. It's a little bit hard to see on this time frame. But as I zoom out to a three-year it'll come back in focus.And here we go, M right there. Now, if this neckline is violated, probably heading down to test a lower support area, 150 that big round number that could be one. And then below that, I got 125 to 130. And that would take it down to the place where it was exactly three years ago, so unchanged. Apple, as they say, so goes Apple, so goes the rest of the market. Not this year. Really hasn't been able to capitalize on that AI train.And you can really see this when we take a look at NVIDIA versus Apple all by itself. Here is year-to-date. Apple down 10%. NVIDIA up 80%. But over the last three years, NVIDIA just a much more high beta play. I don't know if it's fair to compare these two together, but there you go, Apple and Nvidia.And I will leave you with this because we've been talking about the race between Tesla and some of the other market cap leaders. Visa just passed Tesla, by the way. But check out what's happening with Apple and Nvidia.

2024-03-12T14:29:12.000Z,Apple will allow direct app downloads from developers in Europe,"Apple (AAPL) will begin to allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites in Europe, falling in line with European Union (EU) regulations.Yahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down the latest development for Apple and what it could mean for the company moving forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Apple shares ticking slightly lower this morning, off just about 7/10ths of a percent after the company announced that it will allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites. Now this is a part of the changes that are required by new EU rules. Now this will only be available for users in the EU. But this is really, broadly speaking, a part of that overhaul that we have been talking about now for quite some time. It's going to permit third-party marketplaces to offer their own developed apps. And we bring this up because of the impact that this could potentially have on Apple's bottom line, at least in the EU here over the coming quarters, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, that's right. And they said in a blog post as well here they're going to be providing more of that flexibility for developers distributing apps in the European Union, including that new way to distribute apps directly from the developer's website, as you mentioned. They also added here that the developers are going to get access to APIs, those-- those application programming interfaces that help with the distribution of their apps from web integrate with system functionality, backup, and restore users apps, and much more, the company is saying here. So this is a significant move, really prompted by, I would say kind of two major cases that move forward. One of them, of course, being Epic Games.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then another one-- And what Spotify was really pushing back on with Apple. And so all of this placed even more of a spotlight on the fees that Apple gets from this, up to 30%.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then additionally-- 30% of the revenues, I should say. And then additionally here, the number of users data that they have access to that they eventually are able to kind of block off or, you know, institute more of their privacy mechanisms to make sure that the people who are actually developing the app are not getting as much access to that as well. Yet Apple is able to retain and advertise on top of that, even more so.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you're exactly right there. And then also just putting this in perspective for investors out there who are looking at Apple and just saying what this could mean for the company going forward, Apple gets about a quarter of its revenue from Europe. It makes that it's the second biggest revenue driver here for the company in fiscal 2023. It makes up 42%. And its revenue come from the Americas, 25% from Europe, followed by just about 19% from Greater China.So we have talked time and time again about the issues that they are having within China, the fact that iPhone demand seems to be slumping. Uhh, at least it has been in recent quarters and then since the start of the year. So another potential issue here, uh, is important for investors to keep in mind when it comes to the European business.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-allow-direct-app-downloads-142912702.html
2024-03-07T20:58:18.000Z,"Hey, Bottom Fishers! 3 Beaten Up Stocks to Buy for Short-Term Gains","One tool that bargain hunters can utilize to identify beaten up stocks to buy after significant declines is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI signals when a stock’s downward momentum may be exhausted, indicating that a correction could provide upside potential.Typically, an RSI reading below 30 is viewed as an ‘oversold’ level, suggesting the asset may be due to a rebound. However, the RSI alone is insufficient to conclude a buying opportunity exists in beaten up stocks to buy. A thorough review of the company’s financial position is prudent to evaluate whether value currently exists.The following three stocks have seen their share prices decline substantially recently. Although their RSIs indicate oversold conditions, their underlying business fundamentals still appear sound. This provides a potential for short-term gains for investors looking for certain beaten up stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Tada Images / ShutterstockAlbertsons (NYSE:ACI) has been heavily featured in the news lately, largely due to Kroger’s proposed merger announced in October 2022. However, the deal has faced significant obstacles. Recently, the FTC filed a lawsuit that has placed the merger’s fate in the hands of the judiciary. This has unsettled investors, sending the ACI lower to its 14-day RSI of 11.6.While a successful consummation of the Kroger deal could deliver substantial upside, Albertsons maintains robust financials even without the merger. Its latest Q3 earnings demonstrated this resiliency, with diluted EPS jumping over 300%. Due to its undervaluation and strong fundamentals, ACI could be considered one of the beaten up stocks to buy.Albertsons trades at a relatively low valuation, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.7x – less than half the broader U.S. grocery sector at 17.2x. This leaves the stock undervalued, representing one of the more compelling beaten up stocks to buy for patient investors.​Source: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.comMedifast (NYSE:MED) has been facing some headwinds lately. The weight loss and supplement company suffered from consumers’ ability to hire weight loss coaches and the arrival of Ozempic and other drugs. The most recent earnings missed expectations, weighing heavily on the price of this beaten up stock to buy. Management remains hopeful of a turnaround following a deal with LifeMD (NASDAQ:LFMD) to expand sales channels.The company’s shares dropped significantly, with its RSI reaching an oversold level of just 5.9. What’s interesting for potential investors is that Medifast trades at a P/E ratio of only 4.2x despite the earnings miss. The forward dividend yield stands at 17.4%, and the company increased its cash holdings. This indicates that the dividend is well covered and provides attractive value for investors in this beaten-up stock.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comEven major technology firms are not immune to market volatility, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders are now well aware. The iPhone maker experienced a difficult beginning in 2024 as sales in China and across the EU fell short of expectations. Apple’s stock price has dropped 12% this year, placing the company – a long-term favorite of Warren Buffett – in its most oversold position in six years at an RSI of just 22.1.While a business as large and well-established as Apple may not immediately spring to mind when considering beaten up stocks to buy, technical analysts note the current weakness presents investors with a potential buying opportunity to secure a high-quality business at a temporarily discounted valuation. Only time will tell if 2024 brings an uptick in fortunes for the technology titan. However, long-term backers will hope current headwinds prove a mere blip rather than the start of a longer-term downtrend.​Apple’s P/E ratio trades at just 26.3x, below the S&P 500‘s 27.7x. Investors may see the beaten up stock to buy as a good quality choice that will shine through in the longer run.On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Instead, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.The reasons for the declines are many and include weak guidance for the year ahead, problems in overseas markets such as China, and declining spending on the part of consumers. While notable, these issues are by no means insurmountable and it is unlikely that many of the leading companies will see their share prices stay down for long.As such, investors would be smart to pounce on the stocks while the share price is still in the red. After all, the goal remains to buy low and sell high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany companies whose stocks are down currently recognize the problems they’re experiencing and are taking proactive steps to fix the issues, with some companies announcing ambitious, multi-year growth strategies. Again, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is having a tough time right now. Year-to-date, the consumer electronics giant’s share price is down 8%. That compares to a 7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index so far in 2024.The company’s share price is declining on growing concerns about sales of its signature devices. Mostly the iPhone. And mostly in China. AAPL stock just got rocked by a report from Counterpoint Research that showed Apple’s iPhone sales in China declined 24% during the first six weeks of the year.While the Chinese market, and iPhone sales, are areas of concern, there are still plenty of reasons to be bullish on the company and its stock. The services side of Apple’s business (streaming, banking and apps) are more than making up for declines in sales of the company’s hardware. Apple’s earnings continue to beat Wall Street estimates. And the company has just launched a brand new electronic device with its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. And Apple is now turning its attention to artificial intelligence (AI).Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another leading technology company whose stock is down this year. Since the start of January, GOOGL fell about 4%.Unfortunately, its value dropped 8% in the last month after Alphabet launched a defective AI image generator that drew much scorn on social media. The AI image launch was so bad that even Google co-founder Sergey Brin publicly criticized it, saying that the company “definitely messed up.”The poorly received image generator has heightened concerns that Alphabet is falling behind in the AI race, sending its stock lower.However, investors would be foolish to count out Alphabet. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just put out a note urging clients to stick with GOOGL stock. JPMorgan says that Alphabet will get its AI program back on track and any backlash against the company will be short lived. JPMorgan adds that Alphabet has the resources and talent to close the AI gap with its rivals.Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comIt’s an extremely tough time to be a shareholder of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Since the start of the year, TSLA stock has plummeted 27%. The company’s stock has been the sixth worst performer in the S&P 500 index so far this year. The drop comes amid rising concerns about demand for electric vehicles. While the entire EV market is experiencing a downturn, the impact has been especially damaging at Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle sales.Like Apple, Tesla is having a particularly difficult time in China, where an economic slowdown has led consumers to put off motor vehicle purchases, particularly pricey electric vehicles. TSLA stock recently fell 7% in a single day on news that the company’s EV sales in China have fallen to their lowest level in more than a year. While Tesla certainly faces what look to be long-term challenges, its important to remember that the stock has been here before — several times.Between November 2021 and January 2023, TSLA stock fell 72% only to come roaring back. Company CEO Elon Musk retains a devoted following among retail investors.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comShares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) were clobbered after the company’s recent earnings print. The cybersecurity firm’s share price fell nearly 30%, for its worst one-day performance ever, after management lowered their full-year guidance for both revenue and billings.The downbeat guidance completely overshadowed the fact that Palo Alto Networks beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results, reporting earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of $1.98 billion.Senior executives at the company did their best to explain that the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. Unfortunately, nobody seemed to listen beyond the news that the company lowered its guidance for the year ahead.In time, this will all be smoothed out and Palo Alto’s AI strategy will be made clear. There are already signs of a recovery, with PANW stock having moved 11% higher from its post-earnings bottom.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has restarted talks with the union that is organizing workers at its U.S. stores and says it is willing to negotiate labor agreements. This approach can only help SBUX stock, which is down 13% over the past 12 months and near a 52-week low.Up until now, Starbucks had fought unionization drives at its stores that began in 2021, and the issue has harmed the company’s reputation and share price. Starbucks has also been hurt by a boycott in the U.S. and increased discounting by rivals in overseas markets, notably China.However, there is reason for optimism with SBUX. Not only is Starbucks taking a proactive approach to labor relations, but the company has also unveiled details of a strategic plan that will see the retail coffee chain open 17,000 new locations by 2030 even as it cuts $3 billion in costs. Management at Starbucks is being assertive on all fronts.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) also has a strategy to help it grow in coming years. In December, the quick service restaurant chain announced a plan to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. Those targets are part of the company’s plans to grow its worldwide sales and boost its stock price, which is down 2% year to date after trading sideways over the past 12 months.McDonald’s has also announced plans to attract and retain customers with revamped versions of its burgers and chicken nuggets. For this year, McDonald’s is projecting net new restaurant growth of 4%. After next year, the company plans to grow its restaurant count by 5% annually. By 2027, the company wants to have 50,000 restaurant locations globally. To reach that goal, McDonald’s plans to open 900 new locations in America, 1,900 restaurants internationally, and 7,000 units in developing markets.The company is also testing a new spin-off brand called “CosMc’s” that is aimed at teens and twentysomethings. The growth strategy is a big reason to believe in a comeback for MCD stock.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comShares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) hit the skids. The athletic apparel company, known for its yoga pants and workout clothes, saw its share price fall 12% so far in 2024. The selloff comes after the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the final quarter of last year, which included the year-end holiday shopping period. However, there is reason to believe that LULU stock can get up off the mat and rise again.First, the company has since revised up its fourth quarter 2023 sales and profit forecasts on strong sales during the holidays. Lululemon next reports earnings on March 26. Second, Lululemon is expanding into a new market segment with the launch of men’s sneakers. The company says it wants to gain market share in the male sportswear segment after dominating in the women’s market. The men’s footwear includes two running shoes and a casual sneaker that hit stores on Feb. 13 of this year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

2024-03-07T18:00:14.000Z,Stocks to Avoid: 3 Companies You Have No Business Buying Today,"Overall, it’s certainly great for investors that we’ve entered the phase of the bull market in which nearly everyone is becoming much more upbeat about stocks. After all, it’s obviously much easier to make money now in the market than it was last year and many times easier than was the case in 2022.At the same time, however, it’s also becoming much easier to get enticed into buying stocks with poor fundamentals that are nevertheless rallying due to investors increased optimism. Of course, those who buy such equities often lose a great deal of money on them in the longer run, since selling names that you once passionately believed in is not always easy to do.Here are three stocks to avoid in order to prevent yourself from falling into that trap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisualsGameStop (NYSE:GME) rallied about 18% between Feb. 22 and the afternoon of March 6. However, there’s no evidence that the firm’s fundamental problems are easing.Specifically, the retailer’s main business of selling hard copies of video games is slowly disappearing since most such games are being downloaded now. And while the company is also generating significant revenue by selling collectibles such as figures and coins, the latter business is commoditized and consequently not very profitable.Some may be enticed by the board’s decision to allow the firm to buy the stocks of other firms. But given the decisions by CEO Ryan Cohen to invest in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, which subsequently went bankrupt, and his purchase of GME stock itself, I would not expect big returns from the firm’s stock-purchasing programs.Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a Feb. 9 column,  “Sinking U.S. fertility rates are likely to undermine the businesses of companies whose products are primarily used by children.” After reporting that from 2007 to 2022, the birth rate tumbled nearly 23%.” I identified toy maker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) as one of the firms that was being undermined by the latter trend. Hasbro’s fourth-quarter results, reported on Feb. 13, show that its struggles continued late last year. Indeed, its top line tumbled 23% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.29 billion. Moreover, its net loss ballooned to $1.06 billion last quarter from $129 million in Q4 of 2023.Additionally, since many of today’s millennial parents are probably much more likely to be concerned about the impact of exposing their children to violent toys, chances are high that they are less likely to encourage their children to play with war-oriented toys than preceding generations of parents. The latter trend, in turn, is negative for HAS, which markets  G.I. Joe and Star Wars toys.Finally, toys have generally been getting much cheaper in recent years, probably due to increases in the amount of toys imported from developing countries. The latter trend, of course, is also negative for Hasbro and HAS stock.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) has historically obtained almost 80% of its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter tech giant incorporates Cirrus’ “audio chips and IC controllers” into most of its hardware.And the demand for Apple’s iPhones in China, its second-largest market, has reportedly been sinking. Indeed, iPhone unit sales in the Asian country reportedly tumbled “24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.”Also noteworthy is that, although Apple’s revenue from its iPhone sales rose 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, the figure was slightly below the peak reached in the final calendar quarter of 2021.Of course, a sharp decline of iPhone sales in China would very bad news for Cirrus, which obtains a small amount of revenue for each iPhone handed over to consumers.Despite these issues, CRUS stock has advanced nearly 20% since early February.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07T12:44:18.000Z,RIVN Stock Forecast: What Will It Take for Rivian to Turn Things Around?,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) and other early-stage EV companies posted disastrous Q4 earnings. Last week, RIVN stock made quite the waves in the startup EV industry (for the wrong reasons), plunging to its lowest levels in a year.The EV stock bubble peaked in Q4 2021, just when Rivian went public, with Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) market cap surging past $1.2 trillion. This year is seeing automaker giants thrive as EV startups struggle. Tesla’s operating margins have been slashed by half, and Rivian faces its own problem set.Can RIVN stock recover from what went wrong?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management floated that since the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Car project was canceled, Apple should consider buying Rivian Automotive. Given Apple’s standing as a tech business and its lack of top-line growth in recent quarters, Munster spotlighted its need for growth and its potential for expansion into key markets.On that note of Apple needing to expand, Munster said Apple could acquire Rivian. He pointed out DJ Novotney’s January switch from Apple to Rivian. Munster has long awaited for Apple’s market cap to reach $3 trillion.Munster was taken aback at Apple’s cancellation of the Apple Car project, which could have increased Apple’s revenue by $250 billion yearly. Rivian’s production estimate for 2023 is in line with its output, which raises eyebrows on its financial reserves until 2026.Munster changed the focus of his Apple future predictions to AI development. Investors shouldn’t place all of their faith in this for Rivian, though, since the market for EVs is still questionable.What comes after a poor Q4 performance and a stock nosedive? RIVN stock answers this with a plan to lay off 10% of its salaried staff, affecting about 150 Bay Area workers. Palo Alto’s job cuts will start on April 23.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe faced backlash for completely blindsiding staff. The reason? Announcing the layoffs through email. Rivian may be reporting a whopping $5.4 billion loss in 2023. And for 2024? $2.7 billion.The $70,000 R1T pickup and $75,000 R1S SUV added color to Rivian’s lineup. To cut expenses, it plans to close a factory in Illinois and change the engineering of vehicles. CEO Scaringe pledged to promote the use of EVs while being confident in the face of economic difficultiesElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, made it known that high-volume production with positive cash flow isn’t just resolved with a decent product design. Thus, Musk alerted Rivian that the company may declare bankruptcy in six months. Therefore, Rivian should lessen costs and have its executive team be in the factory to prevent failure.Rivian saw some early gains, but its stock seems to rebound slowly. Issues facing the EV sector might only go away once the macroeconomy stabilizes. For Rivian to succeed, it must increase production, cut losses, introduce new models, and set eyes for gross profit in 2024.To prevent more future losses, steer clear of RIVN’s current direction.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2024-03-13T21:10:41.000Z,'Noise isn't going away' on TikTok bill: US policy expert,"The House of Representatives voted 352 to 65 in favor of a bill that would force TikTok's parent company ByteDance to divest from the company or sell to a US-based company within 6 months. The likelihood of the bill passing through the Senate and landing on President Biden's desk has been called into question considering the timing of the presidential election and the usual slow reaction time from the Senate.Wolfe Research Head of US Policy and Politics Tobin Marcus joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the bill and what are the most likely next steps through Congress and beyond.When asked if it will ever get through the Senate and be signed into law, Marcus claims: ""I think the realistic avenue for getting this done is the next annual defense policy bill, the so-called NDAA for FY [Fiscal Year] '25, which will get done sometimes after the election... that's a bill that happens every year, sort of one of the last bona fide bipartisan things that gets done. TikTok has some level of national security angle to it, it's not a defense policy question but it is somewhat germane...""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoJOSH LIPTON: The House of Representatives passing a controversial bill to give China's ByteDance six months to sell TikTok or face a US ban of the app. That bill which raised issues of national security easily passed by a wide margin in the House. But it is not a done deal yet. Of course, still faces major hurdles in the Senate.Joining us now is Tobin Marcus, Wolfe Research Head of US Policy and Politics. Tobin, it is good to see you. So, Tobin, the House passes this bill by a landslide? But, of course, now our attention turns to what happens in the Senate, what do you think is going to happen there, Tobin?TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, I think mostly, a lot of nothing is going to happen. We're going to see a lot of comments from senators. We're going to see a lot of people saying that they agree that TikTok is a threat, that they want to take a close look at this bill, that they have concerns about the specific approach.But, in general, the Senate tends not to feel a lot of pressure just because the house happens to vote on something, multiple different folks in the Senate, not least of them Maria Cantwell, Chair of Senate Commerce Committee which is one of the committees that will have jurisdiction here, have been working on their own approaches to TikTok for quite a while now.And the fact that the House suddenly leapt into action on this bill over the course of the past week or so, I think is not necessarily going to make them feel like they need to go ahead and do something right away. And signals from Senate leadership are they're going to run a normal process where everyone is in the loop and everyone gets time to weigh in on the approach, which means probably that this is going to drag out without clear signals in the Senate longer past the point that there is an obvious vehicle to attach it to.Because we're getting closer and closer to the election. And there are sort of not that many bills that are going to get done between now and the end of the year.JULIE HYMAN: So if it doesn't get done now, will it ever get done?TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, I mean, I think that the realistic avenue for getting this done is the next annual defense policy bill, the so-called NDAA, for FY 25, which will get done sometime after the election in the November, December, January time frame. That's a bill that happens every year, one of the last bona fide bipartisan things that gets done.TikTok has some level of national security angle to it. It's not a defense policy question, but it is somewhat germane. So I think it's a foregone conclusion that we see, an attempt to attach this bill to the House version of NDAA.Possible that the Senate goes along with that in putting their version together over the summer. So I think that's sort of the next threat that we're looking at. And even if they miss that boat, you know, I don't think that the noise is going away on this, whether it's this bill or some other bill. Like the concern is clear.JOSH LIPTON: And, Tobin, if this did become law, I'm just interested to get your take. How do you think the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party would respond, Tobin? Would there be a risk do you think they retaliate in China?A lot of American companies do a lot of business over there. From Apple, to Tesla, to NVIDIA.TOBIN MARCUS Yeah, so it's an interesting question. It's come up a lot over the course of variety of different economic restrictions the US has rolled out. On China, not least of them the exports on or the restrictions on semiconductor capital exports that have been rolled out and tightened over the course of the past couple of years.And, generally, we have not seen that much in the way of direct Chinese retaliation. I mean, certainly, directly in the social media and internet advertising domain. It is already the case that the sort of big US internet Giants are not allowed to have much penetration into China.And, you know, I think they have a lot to lose in terms of really sort of draconian retaliation that is essentially unrelated to what's going on here. If they were to go after Apple, like there are a lot of jobs and economic activity inside of China that are connected to Apple's manufacturing footprint there.So I think probably we'll see some symbolic actions. But I don't know that it really qualitatively changes the US-China economic relationship or the kind of risks that we face there.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/noise-isnt-going-away-tiktok-211041721.html
2024-03-14T13:33:13.000Z,"Apple Stock Has 31% Upside, According to This Wall Street Analyst","After climbing 48% in 2023, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed so far in 2024. The stock is down about 11% year to date, in part, due to worries regarding slowing iPhone sales in China. However, one Wall Street analyst sees this price dip as a buying opportunity.Earlier this week, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan renewed his $225 price target on the stock. That price target represents a potential upside of about 31% in the next 12 months or so over the current share price of $171.A recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year over year in the first six weeks of the year. This seems to be what is weighing on the stock right now, but Mohan noted that Apple has an important option for dealing with this.Apple does an effective job of lowering the prices of its older phones to maintain steady demand, according to Mohan. The analyst also says Apple's long-term trend of shifting customers toward higher-value units can help offset weak sales in China. China generated 21% of Apple's operating profit last quarter.China sales are getting the blame for the stock's recent performance, but the shares were due for a correction. The stock traded at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 32 at the end of 2023 and now trade at a more reasonable P/E of 27, which is still higher than the market average.Despite weakness in China, Apple's earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, mostly driven by growing revenue in the higher-margin services category, and the company's ongoing share repurchases.It might take a while for the market to come around, but Apple has plenty of strengths outside of China to deliver returns to investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-14T13:26:39.000Z,13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. The close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.Another change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.  reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.In fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.These stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.However, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.This wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.With these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).A close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside.

2024-03-14T11:28:29.000Z,12 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now,"In this article, we discuss 12 best Guru stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.According to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios. Meanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.In this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Guru’s Stake as of March 11: $646,085Apple Inc.

It has the surgical steps and equipment built into it in detail. This information is reviewed in a mixed reality environment before and during the surgical episode allowing for the scrub team to view the process and equipment in real time during the procedure and be guided by the visual overlays,"" eXeX explained to FOX Business.For the spinal procedures, the Vision Pro was used by a member of the scrub team on Cromwell Hospital’s complex spine team. One of the surgeons involved in the surgeries, Dr. Syed Aftab, said in a statement that it and the eXeX software ""has improved efficiency"" within the group.The use of the Apple Vision Pro during that set of surgeries came about a month after Apple first made the augmented reality headset available in the U.S. with a $3,499.99 starting price tag.APPLE TARGETING SPORTS FANS WITH NEW APPREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPJessica Melugin, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Technology and Innovation, called it a ""great example of the promise"" of the technology.""If regulators don’t get in the way, there will be increasing medical and health benefits like this one,"" she told FOX Business.

2024-03-14T07:03:42.000Z,IPhone Maker Hon Hai’s Profit Soars 33% as AI Buoys Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported its second straight quarter of strong profit growth after lucrative AI hardware sales helped offset weakness in iPhone and electronics demand.Most Read from BloombergPutin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for RussiaUS House Passes Bill That Would Force TikTok Sale or Ban ItAn $80 Billion Crash in India’s Small Caps Flashes Warning SignsUkraine Hits Third Russian Refinery in Escalating Drone StrikesEx-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic PrimaryThe world’s largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones posted a 33% rise in net income to NT$53.2 billion ($1.7 billion) in the quarter ended December. That beat an average of analyst estimates of NT$43.8 billion, helped by a large one-time gain.The company’s shares are up more than 15% this year, buoyed by growing optimism about Foxconn’s opportunity to benefit from demand for artificial intelligence servers and hardware. The Taiwanese assembler, known also as Foxconn, wasn’t among the initial cohort of companies boosted by the AI frenzy, but investors and analysts see it likely to gain a growing share of such business. This month, it was reported to have secured a major order from longtime US partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.For the current period, Hon Hai had forecast that sales would decline again, as it’s coming off an elevated comparison base from the post-pandemic recovery period early last year. AI sales have helped it improve profit while weathering a down year for the iPhone, the flagship product that first brought Foxconn global renown.“The business saw a good sequential rebound into Q4 partly driven by the AI-focused side, but if you take a step back and look at 2023 as a whole, it was a relatively weak year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea said. “The company should have a much better year as their main customers start to rebuild inventory.”JPMorgan earlier this week said that Foxconn’s rally could extend as the market is betting increasingly on the company’s prospects in AI server infrastructure from the second half of the year. Analysts including Gokul Hariharan estimate that Hon Hai’s AI revenue and gross profit exposure is likely to be in the 10-12% range in 2025.Still, with Apple making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. This month, Counterpoint Research said iPhone sales in China fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.(Updates with analyst reaction)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/iphone-maker-hon-hai-profit-062358359.html

It also contrasts sharply with remarks by Foxconn Chairman Young Liu in November that the world's largest contract electronics maker had ""relatively conservative and neutral"" expectations for 2024.""We see very strong demand for AI servers from our clients,"" Liu told an online earnings conference, adding that he expects the business to have revenue growth of more than 40% this year.The AI server market was likely to see 30% growth each year between 2023 and 2025, and Foxconn's growth would be in line with that or even higher, he said.October-December net profit for the Taiwanese company came in at T$53.1 billion ($1.7 billion), handily beating a T$43.5 billion LSEG SmartEstimate. The 33% surge in profit was the strongest year-on-year growth logged for a quarter since March 2021.In addition to robust demand for AI servers, it also had better-than-expected sales of cloud and networking products and smart consumer electronics.Apple last month reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business though its China sales missed analysts' estimates.In the fourth quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 58% of Foxconn's revenue while cloud and networking products which include servers contributed 20%.Although it expects healthy growth over 2024, Foxconn cautioned that first-quarter revenue was set to come in lower than the same period a year ago when sales surged after pandemic restrictions were lifted in China.Chief Financial Officer David Huang also said that 2024 growth in capital expenditure would at least match last year's rate, partly due to the company's drive to diversify investment around the world and expand into areas such as electric vehicles and semiconductors.Foxconn's capital expenditure climbed 14% in 2023 to around T$111.7 billion ($3.6 billion).

Trust the process as some of our viewers might remember.And I think that investors right now are essentially continuing to believe, I guess, for themselves, I guess, for their clients just for the general 2024 story, which is that the Fed will cut rates, and it will end up being fine. And a lot of what worked in '23 will work in '24. Well, that continues to play out.And I think you see that really in the sector action with technology doing all of the work today. And the market cap gains that we've seen over the course of this year, obviously, make the skew there, let's say, on a sector basis even more important for the index level move.JULIE HYMAN: All right, I'm curious about the second takeaway there with the real Magnificent Seven.JARED BLIKRE: Here we go. This is a fun part.MYLES UDLAND: All right, so Jared and I were talking about this a little bit earlier. And he crunched the numbers. So we have a little divergence within real Mag Seven.But I think over the last few weeks, we have all circled this idea that Apple and Tesla are kind of out. Like they have been laggards. I mean, Tesla is down for the year.They have been laggards relative to the guys in the Magnificent Seven doing a lot of the work, which is really NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Meta at this point. So I am proposing two new entrants to the Magnificent Seven. Eli Lilly, which is now I think what the eighth biggest company in the S&P, something like this.Bank of America's note last week at $1,000 bucks a share. Had it basically at $1 trillion market cap, about $950 billion.And the second is Costco. Now, Costco is I think 22nd right now in the S&P 500 on a market cap basis. But the reaction that we saw on Costco last week to that revenue miss which was a small revenue miss.I think stock was down 7% to 8% in a day. And that was a day where all the 2024 trades cooled off. And Costco has been at the center of like, don't worry, just buy it at 50 times earnings.It's fine. Everyone loves Costco. And it has taken on like mega caps are now, I don't want to say meme stocks. But there's a meme of like just buy this mega cap theme.Costco continues to benefit from this premiumization, I guess, of consumer habits. And it's just a safe place that you can put money, and you can tell someone we're now overweight Costco. And everyone that is your investors can be like, that's great. I love Costco.JARED BLIKRE: I love how you're stuffing a consumer staple in the Magnificent Seven.MYLES UDLAND: It doesn't act like a staple. Look at the stock.JULIE HYMAN: It just feels wrong to me to have Costco in there with those other companies.MYLES UDLAND: So I was looking at this. I think there's also a discussion to be had about where Alphabet fits within the Magnificent Seven. I know the Magnificent Three is kind of where it's at.JARED BLIKRE: It's flat on the year. So where does it go? Yeah. I don't know. I will say this.When I was crunching the numbers, looking at the disparity between the old Mag Seven, the new one with Costco, and Lilly, it makes a difference. Going back to our chart, if you go back to the beginning of 2020, the Mag Seven original is up 155%.If you switch Costco and Eli Lilly, and it's up 171%. 171. But the mag 4 is at 187%. So it just goes to show you we don't need Costco, we don't need Eli Lilly. We need more concentration.We need the Mag One. And maybe that's it. And that's where you go. That's how you take this to its illogical extreme conclusion in case you were wondering.MYLES UDLAND: Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: The last takeaway that I should mention here is the last point on your screen, which was the most important dot plot ever. Is that since the last dot plot, or are you being-- Are you not being-- wait-- are you, Myles Udland, not being facetious?MYLES UDLAND: I think next Wednesday's dot plot is the most important dot plot the Fed has ever released. And the reason why is that when they came out in December, and they said we're going to cut rates three times in 2024, the market said, all right, we'll buy that. We think it's going to be 6.And over the last few months, there's been a convergence. The market is now at 3 to match the Fed. In that time, the S&P is up 7% or 8%. We're just talking about all the action in the Magnificent Seven for, however, many stocks.All those memes are still in play. Now, you're getting softwares rallying. Chinese tech stocks. Like everything's great in the market.On the condition that the markets still believe the Fed will cut rates three times. If they come out next week, and they say we're going to cut rates once, I think you are then having a conversation about, are we getting to the June dot plot and discussing rate hikes or no cuts this year?And I think a lot of what the market has become comfortable with in the last few weeks is that this is delayed gratification, not removed reward essentially. And if the Fed comes out and suggests that there's a wholesale change in how they're approaching rate cuts in 2024, then you could be like, all right, maybe we've got a problem here.JULIE HYMAN: Just one quick note on that, too, that I think is interesting. Jay Powell really downplayed the dot plot at certain times in the past. But it feels like maybe that was the wrong call because it turns out the dot plot actually was the more accurate read.MYLES UDLAND: And if you look at his testimony last week, he did the same thing. He's trying to downplay it. And I think the reason he's trying to downplay it is because he knows that it has only risen in importance.Like the thing is if you look at '23, the Fed's dot plot told you they were going to be more aggressive, told you they were not looking to cut rates. And while he wants to back away from that, it has been a pretty good guide in the last couple of years.So what they say next week, markets correctly will probably infer. It's going to be a guide for what happens in balance of this year.JARED BLIKRE: I like your thinking. We had some fun earlier. But that's some serious deep dive thinking that--MYLES UDLAND: I know the whole thing is like I'm always kidding. And I don't mean it. But like, I actually think some--JARED BLIKRE: This is how you got to head of news.MYLES UDLAND: For whatever that is. I mean, is that title serious? I don't know.JULIE HYMAN: Yes.JARED BLIKRE: All right, thank you, Myles.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/investor-patience-mag-7-shakeup-212616701.html

2024-03-14T13:30:09.000Z,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Apple (AAPL): Should You Buy?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Check price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is AAPL Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But one of its core technologies is making artificial intelligence systems smaller and faster. That work that could be helpful to Apple, which is focused on running AI on devices rather than entirely in the cloud.Alexander Wong, an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who helped build the business, has joined Apple as a director in its AI group as part of the deal.In response to questions about the deal, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” but doesn’t discuss its plans.Apple shares briefly gained on the news, rising more than 1% to $173.37. It was trading at $172.92 as of 1:29 p.m. in New York, down about 10% for the year.Waterloo, Ontario-based DarwinAI had raised more than $15 million as of 2022, according to the Canadian startup community Communitech. It received investments from Honeywell Ventures and Inovia Capital, among other venture capital firms. The startup also has worked with companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Intel Corp., according to Communitech.The under-the-radar acquisition comes ahead of a big AI push for Apple this year. The company is adding features to its iOS 18 software that rely on generative AI, the technology behind ChatGPT and other groundbreaking tools. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple will “break new ground” in AI this year, and an announcement is expected as soon as the company’s worldwide developers conference in June.Despite having acquired more AI companies than most rivals over the past decade, Apple has fallen behind in the generative AI market.

2024-03-13T20:23:32.000Z,It’s not all doom and gloom for Apple in 2024,"Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.Those headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.And, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.Wall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.Plus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added.Apple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”Apple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.Apple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway.According to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”But one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.That, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.All of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-14T23:21:09.000Z,Warren Buffett Said Steve Jobs Completely Ignored His Advice On How To Invest Apple's Cash,"Warren Buffett shared a look into a conversation with Steve Jobs about Apple Inc.'s financial strategy during a 2012 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”In the ""Ask Warren"" segment, Buffett said, “It was an interesting conversation because I hadn’t talked to him in a long time. He said, ‘We’ve got all this cash. What should we do with it?’ So we went over the alternatives. It was kind of interesting.”This dialogue between two industry titans sheds light on the decision-making process at one of the world’s most valuable companies.Don't Miss:For many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough?Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.Jobs, known for his transformative role in making Apple a global technology leader, reached out to Buffett to seek advice on the company’s cash-management strategies. Buffett, a legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., outlined the four primary options available for deploying cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, or holding onto it.Despite Jobs’s acknowledgment that Apple’s stock was undervalued, indicating that buybacks could be a wise choice, he ultimately decided against taking any action, preferring to maintain the company’s cash reserves.“I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,"" Buffett said. ""And then I asked him the question, I said, ‘I would use it for buybacks if I thought my stock was undervalued.’ And I said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ The stock was 200-and-something. He said, ‘I think my stock is very undervalued.’ I said, ‘Well, what better to do with your money?’""Jobs liked having the cash and that was what he ultimately decided was his best option. Buffett added that Jobs interpreted their conversation as Buffett endorsing his decision to hold onto the cash. ""I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash,"" Buffett said.Trending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?The discussion between Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett underscores a cautious financial approach, contrasting sharply with the bold actions of Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook. Cook’s tenure at Apple witnessed aggressive stock buybacks, totaling over $500 billion in the last decade, a sum surpassing the market capitalization of major corporations like Visa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and ExxonMobil Corp. This demonstrates Apple’s steadfast commitment to repurchasing its shares.Apple’s buyback strategy not only boosted shareholder value but also increased Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in the company, despite no additional investment. Berkshire Hathaway, holding nearly 6% of Apple, benefited from these repurchases.Buffett publicly endorsed Apple’s buyback endeavors, citing their positive impact on Berkshire’s holdings and Apple’s ecosystem in his 2021 letter to shareholders.While Jobs prioritized liquidity, Cook utilized Apple’s financial robustness to actively manage its capital structure. This approach solidified Apple’s leadership in the technology sector, delivering value to both shareholders and stakeholders.Read Next: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

2024-03-15T01:55:53.000Z,Hon Hai Jumps by Most in Years After Strong AI Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. shares saw their biggest intraday jump in more than three years after the company forecast strong growth for its AI hardware sales this year.Most Read from BloombergMillennium Trader Scored $40 Million Windfall in Egypt FX PlungeSpaceX Starship Nears Orbit, But Is Lost Before Return to EarthApple Buys Canadian AI Startup as It Races to Add FeaturesBond Yields Jump as Hot Inflation Curbs Fed Wagers: Markets WrapBiden’s Best Shot Against Trump Lies in ‘Blue Wall’ StatesThe Taiwanese firm expects its artificial intelligence server business to grow by 40% this year and is targeting a 40% share of that overall market, Chairman Young Liu said on an earnings call Thursday. The company, known also as Foxconn, reported its second straight quarter of strong profit growth after lucrative AI hardware sales helped offset weakness in iPhone and consumer electronics demand.Shares jumped as much as 9.5% in Taipei on Friday, extending a rally since the start of this year on growing optimism about Foxconn’s opportunity to benefit from AI demand. The world’s largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones wasn’t among the initial cohort of companies boosted by the AI frenzy, but investors and analysts see it likely to gain a growing share. This month, it was reported to have secured a major order from longtime US partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and UBS Group AG upgraded their price targets for Hon Hai after the company posted a 33% rise in net income to NT$53.2 billion ($1.7 billion) in the quarter ended December.“The company’s competitive strength in providing a total solution (including liquid cooling and switches) through vertical integration would position it well for more project wins,” Citi analysts Carrie Liu and Michael Hung wrote after the results.For the current period, Hon Hai had forecast that sales would decline again, as it’s coming off an elevated comparison base from the post-pandemic recovery period early last year. AI sales have helped it improve profit while weathering a down year for the iPhone, the flagship product that first brought Foxconn global renown.“The business saw a good sequential rebound in Q4 partly driven by the AI-focused side, but if you take a step back and look at 2023 as a whole, it was a relatively weak year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea said. “The company should now have a much better year as its main customers start to rebuild inventory.”JPMorgan earlier this week said that Foxconn’s rally could extend as the market is betting increasingly on the company’s prospects in AI server infrastructure from the second half of the year. Analysts including Gokul Hariharan estimate that Hon Hai’s AI revenue and gross profit exposure is likely to be in the 10-12% range in 2025.Still, with Apple making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. This month, Counterpoint Research said iPhone sales in China fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.(Updates with analyst reaction and chart)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?When It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/iphone-maker-hon-hai-profit-062358359.html
2024-03-14T21:45:20.000Z,Apple (AAPL) Advances While Market Declines: Some Information for Investors,"Apple (AAPL) closed at $173 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.09% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.29% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.35%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.3%.The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 7.07% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.61% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.42%.The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.50, down 1.32% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

2024-03-15T09:06:00.000Z,Here Are All 7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling,"For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street's flagship index, the S&P 500. Since taking the reins as CEO, the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of 4,927,141%, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024. That compares to a total return, including dividends paid, of around 33,500% for the S&P 500 over the same period.Riding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a moneymaking strategy for decades, which is made all the easier thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors are buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for money managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management.Although most investors are intrigued to see what the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying, understanding why Buffett and his team are selling certain stocks can be just as insightful.Based on Berkshire's most recent 13F, Warren Buffett and his team are selling seven stocks.The first sizable holding that found itself on the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is media company Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett's company pared down nearly a third of its position, which had stood at north of 93 million shares.The catalyst for dumping more than 30 million shares looks to be Paramount's undesirable balance sheet. More specifically, the company is lugging around $14.6 billion in long-term debt, compared to just $2.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of the end of 2023. With cord-cutting ongoing and Paramount's streaming segment still losing money, investors (including Buffett) have begun to lose patience.The other side of the coin is that Paramount's streaming segment losses are lessening thanks to higher subscription prices being passed along to users. Further, legacy media companies tend to enjoy a resurgence in ad spending during major election years. Although Paramount Global clearly has concerns to address, things may not be as dire as its poor stock performance would suggest.Another high-profile name that took a big haircut in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio during the fourth quarter is personal computing and printing services provider HP (NYSE: HPQ). Buffett and his aides dumped close to 78% of Berkshire's stake, compared to what was held on Sept. 30, 2023.The impetus behind this selling activity may have to do with the sluggishness of personal computer (PC) sales. Though PC sales surged during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they've meaningfully retraced with most employees returning to the office. With no sales growth forecast for the current year, HP's 3.6% dividend yield simply isn't enough of a lure to keep Buffett and his team interested.HP also looks like a perfect example of a ""fair company at a wonderful price"" that Buffett would prefer to avoid. Although HP stock can be purchased for a mere 8 times forward year earnings, the company's growth days are long gone. Now reliant on relatively low-margin products and printing services, HP lacks the needle-moving results Berkshire's brightest minds desire.Perhaps the most surprising selling activity during the fourth quarter was the roughly 10 million shares Buffett and his investing ""lieutenants"" parted ways with in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Keep in mind that selling 10 million shares only reduced Berkshire's stake in its top holding by 1.1%.Chances are the Oracle of Omaha hasn't changed his tune on what he previously referred to as ""a better business than any we own."" Apple's physical product innovation has led the way for more than a decade, with the company now also emphasizing high-margin subscription services. To boot, Apple has repurchased $650.9 billion of its own common stock since the start of 2013, which is tops among public companies.The most logical reason Buffett and his investing crew pared down their Apple stake is to offset realized investment losses from Paramount Global and HP. Buffett's company is sitting on an estimated $119 billion in unrealized gains on its Apple stock.A popular holding that was given the heave-ho from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter is insurance and investment company Markel Group (NYSE: MKL), which has been dubbed something of a ""mini-Berkshire"" given its penchant for making investments. Buffett and his team dumped their entire position in Markel, which had been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2022.There are two educated guesses as to why Markel found itself on the chopping block. The likeliest answer is valuation. Since 2015, Markel Group had traded at or below 120% of its book value on only a handful of occasions. One of those instances was during the first quarter of 2022. With Markel's premium-to-book value nearing 50% just prior to the start of October 2023, the luster of getting a ""deal"" may have worn off.The other possibility is Weschler or Combs, not Buffett, cut Markel loose. Buffett's investment aides are considerably more active on the trading front than he is, and this position was ultimately held less than two years.Brazil-focused fintech company StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE), which had been a five-year holding in Berkshire's portfolio, was also shown the door during the fourth quarter.The motivation for Buffett and his team to part ways with StoneCo probably had to do with the company's debt-driven challenges. Brazil's central bank raised interest rates to as high as 13.75% in 2022 to get the country's inflation rate under control. Unfortunately, StoneCo's loan division was backed by debt, which sent its servicing costs soaring. Even though management has addressed these issues, StoneCo is still something of a work in progress.On the other hand, StoneCo has its fingers in far more than just payments in Brazil's economy. It offers banking and credit solutions, as well as software, to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Although add-on service adoption is climbing, StoneCo has penetrated just a small fraction of the fintech market in Brazil.The sixth stock Buffett and his team kicked to the curb during the December-ended quarter was longtime holding Globe Life (NYSE: GL). Prior to its departure, life and supplemental health insurance company Globe Life had been a continuous holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for more than two decades.Valuation looks to be the most sensible reason behind Buffett & Co.'s decision to sell. Shares of the company more than doubled following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, sending its price-to-book value to nearly 300% during the fourth quarter. At no point during the 22 years that Berkshire held shares of Globe Life did it sustain a book value of more than 200% for any length of time, let alone near 300%.Buffett and his team are also known for concentrating Berkshire's investments in their top ideas. Globe Life never met the definition of a core holding, which ultimately sealed its fate.Last but not least, the Oracle of Omaha and his team booted homebuilder D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter.This is one of the biggest head-scratchers of all considering shares of D.R. Horton were only acquired during the June-ended quarter. Since Warren Buffett is a firm believer in holding wonderful businesses for extended periods, the purchase and subsequent sale of D.R. Horton suggests that Ted Weschler and/or Todd Combs were the masterminds behind this relatively quick trade.History may also have played a role in dumping shares of D.R. Horton. Homebuilders aren't known for delivering outsized investment returns. Depending on Berkshire's entry and exit, it could have been up north of 50% on its stake in D.R. Horton in under nine months. That's an incredible gain for a traditionally slow-moving, highly cyclical industry. With various money-based metrics and predictive indicators alluding to a possible recession in 2024, locking in gains may have been prudent.Should you invest $1,000 in Paramount Global right now?Before you buy stock in Paramount Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paramount Global wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-15T04:06:05.000Z,Apple acquires AI startup specializing in overlooking manufacturing components,"Apple has added another AI startup to its acquisition list with Canada-based DarwinAI, which specializes in vision-based tech to observe components during manufacturing to improve efficiency, Bloomberg reported.While Apple or DarwinAI haven't announced this deal, several members of the startup's team joined Apple's machine learning teams in January, as per their LinkedIn profiles.DarwinAI had raised over $15 million in funding across various rounds from investors including BDC Capital’s Deep Tech Venture Fund, Honeywell Ventures, Obvious Ventures, and Inovia Capital. BDC Capital confirms on its website that it has received an exit from DarwinAI, whereas Obvious Venture has updated its portfolio to reflect that the startup has been acquired.BDC Capital and Obvious Venture didn't comment on the story at the time of writing. Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.As Bloomberg noted in its report, apart from helping with manufacturing efficiency, DarwinAI uses techniques to make AI models smaller and faster. This could be useful for on-device generative AI features Apple hopes to introduce in iOS 18 this year.Apple has lagged in releasing gen-AI-powered features as compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. In February, Tim Cook said the company plans to introduce such features ""later this year.""“We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Cook said during a quarterly earnings call with analysts.Last year the Apple top exec had confirmed investment into gen-AI efforts. Apple's job listings have suggested the company is exploring infusing AI in multiple internal and external areas including, Siri, developer tools, and customer support.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-in-overlooking-manufacturing-components/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-040605041.html

2024-03-15T21:26:05.000Z,Ex-Apple exec Pete Distad named CEO of sports streaming venture,"Disney's ESPN (DIS), Fox (FOX, FOXA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) have joined forces to launch a joint sports venture streaming service. On Friday, the companies announced Pete Distad, a former Apple (AAPL) and Hulu executive, would serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the upcoming service.The highly anticipated streaming service is slated for launch in the fall, with Wall Street analysts estimating that the service could have a subscription fee ranging between $40 and $50 per month.Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal breaks down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithJULIE HYMAN: The new sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Fox has found its CEO. It's former Apple and Hulu executive. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. She's been following this for more.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So now we have a little bit more context, a little bit more information when it comes to this skinny bundle between ESPN, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Fox. Like you said, Julie, Pete Distad is going to be the new CEO. He's a former executive at-- at both Hulu and Apple. So he has that connection with Disney, which I think is important because he's going to be working across three different companies. So the fact that he's already been at one of those three, I think, is important.Now he was at Apple for a decade. Prior to that, he was at Hulu for six years. But while he was at Apple, he was responsible for the business operations and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts. That included the launch of Apple TV in 2015, the eventual-- eventual launch of the streaming service Apple TV+, and then that $2.5 billion acquisition of MLS Season Pass in 2022.So he has the sports and streaming experience that these three companies had really been looking for. This is a service that's going to launch in the fall. We don't know the price point, but Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said that he expects it to be on the higher end of estimates. Wall Street is estimating between 40 to 50 bucks a month. So expect to pay around that $50 range. He also said that he is-- he expects subscribers to hit around 5 million in five years. So by the year 2029. Just put that number in perspective.YouTube TV, which probably is going to be a pretty big competitor, that has more than 8 million subscribers. And that launched in 2017. So we'll see they're targeting the cord cutters, the cord nevers. I think a big question mark is going to come down to price and how much people are willing to pay for this type of service. Let's find out.JOSH LIPTON: Right now, Alex, it's like 40 to 50 you're hearing out there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's the range. And he did say the higher range of estimates. So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw something between 50 to 55 bucks a month, which is a lot of money. But if you're a big sports fan--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think those people like to pay.JOSH LIPTON: We'll see how big that audience is. That's the money.

2024-03-15T18:16:49.000Z,Apple to pay $490 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about iPhone sales in China,"Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in iPhone's sales in China that culminated in a jarring revision to the company's revenue forecast.The preliminary settlement filed Friday in Oakland, California, federal court stems from a shareholder lawsuit focused on the way Apple relayed information about how iPhone models released in September 2018 were performing in China, one of the company's biggest markets.Cook signaled that the new iPhones were off to a good start during an investor conference call in early November 2018, according to the complaint.That reassurance dissolved into a huge letdown on Jan. 2, 2019 when the Cook issued a warning that Apple's revenue for the just-completed quarter would fall $9 billion below management's forecast for the period. What's more, virtually all of the sales drop was traced to weak demand in China.It marked the first time Apple had cut its revenue guidance since the iPhone's release in 2007 and triggered its stock price to plunge 10% in the next day of frenetic trading, wiping out more than $70 billion in shareholder wealth.Apple vehemently denied Cook deceived investors about the iPhone's sales in China between early November and early January. The Cupertino, California, company maintained that stance in the settlement documents, but said it decided to make the payment after more than four years of legal wrangling to avoid an “overly burdensome, expensive, and distracting” hassle.The settlement was reached through a mediator after U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Apple's request to dismiss the case and set a Sept. 9 trial date.Gonzalez Rogers is now being asked to approve the settlement in a hearing scheduled for April 30.Thousands of shareholders who bought Apple stock in late 2018 could be eligible for a piece of the settlement, which will be distributed from of a pool that will be less than $490 million after lawyers involved in the case are paid. The attorneys plan to seek up to one-fourth, or about $122 million, of the settlement.The $490 million payment represents less than 1% of the $97 billion profit that Apple pocketed during its last fiscal year ended in September. Apple shareholders who have held on to their shares have become wealthier too. Apple's stock price has more than quadrupled from where it stood after Cook's China warning, creating an additional $2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-pay-490-million-settle-181649360.html

2024-03-15T17:03:57.000Z,"Analyst warns that a TikTok ban could lead to major trouble for Apple, Big Tech","The U.S. House on Wednesday passed a bill that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok. As the legislation makes its way to the Senate, Deepwater Management's Gene Munster thanks a ban could prove to be a blow to U.S. tech giants including Apple, Nvidia and Tesla. The House on Wednesday voted (352-65) in favor of a bill that would give TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance 180 days to divest the app, or face a ban.The swift passage of the bill, which was only introduced the week before, serves as the culmination of U.S. regulatory pushes against the popular social media platform.The bill is now on the road toward a Senate vote, though an exact timeline is unclear. The Washington Post reported Friday that the bill will likely face a much longer approval process in the Senate than it did in the House. President Joe Biden has said that he will sign the bill if it passes the Senate.""This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it's a ban,"" TikTok said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses and the 170 million Americans who use our service.""Related: High-profile investor calls TikTok ruling a 'slippery slope'With its Senate path still unclear, Deepwater Management's Gene Munster said Friday that he sees a 50% chance that nothing will happen to TikTok, a 25% chance that the app will be sold and a 25% chance that the app will be banned.Munster thinks that if TikTok is either banned or divested, ""Chinese leadership will argue U.S. tech companies are using their products to spy on the Chinese,"" something that could spark retaliatory efforts against U.S. companies.He said that 23% of Tesla's  (TSLA)  revenue comes from China; it's 18% for Apple  (AAPL)  and 8% for chip giant Nvidia  (NVDA) .Munster noted that, historically, Chinese leadership has ""largely supported Apple products"" over the past eight years, despite tensions between the U.S. and China. Still, he believes there will likely be ""modest pressure"" on China iPhone sales and Tesla sale numbers if the bill becomes law.""Censorship is not the answer, data privacy legislation is."" — Fight for the FutureWedbush's Dan Ives has echoed a similar impression, noting ""potential retaliatory actions China can head towards the likes of Apple and Tesla and U.S. Big Tech,"" though he said that a potential retaliation would likely impact Apple and Tesla the most, particularly as both companies' sales have been struggling in the country lately.Ives likewise sees a 25% chance that TikTok will get banned.Related: Facebook whistleblower explains why Mark Zuckerberg's latest hearing is different than the othersEfforts to ban TikTok have faced harsh criticism in the past, as other social media platforms collect and share the same data that TikTok collects, and some — including X — collect more.Critics have argued that foreign adversaries, including China, could simply purchase this data through data brokers, making a ban that targets TikTok alone unlikely to accomplish much in the way of real data security.""If Congress really cares about the data abuse Americans are subject to because of surveillance capitalist business models, they should pass comprehensive privacy legislation that would stop all Big Tech companies from harvesting our data,"" Fight for the Future, a nonprofit digital rights group, said in a statement. ""The data of Americans is already susceptible to bad actors, foreign and domestic, because Congress has waited so long to act. Censorship is not the answer, data privacy legislation is.""The TikTok bill: if the American people are going to be spied on by an amoral surveillance capitalist data monster, it will be an American-owned amoral surveillance capitalist data monster.— Jacob Silverman (@SilvermanJacob) March 13, 2024Ryan Martin, lead partner at Infosys Consulting’s IT Risk, Governance Risk & Compliance and Cybersecurity practice, told TheStreet that while the bill might serve as a good way to begin a discussion about personal privacy and data protection online, it likely is not enough to actually protect consumer data.""A ban on TikTok could reduce the risk of one entity being coerced to disclose non-public private information to China — but the extent of readily available information on social media in general dwarfs that in my opinion,"" Martin said.

2024-03-15T18:06:56.000Z,Baby formula lawsuit wipes £7bn off FTSE 100 giant,"Consumer goods giant Reckitt has suffered a £7bn share price slump after it lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.London-listed Reckitt’s share price plunged by the most in two decades and to its lowest point in more than a decade after an Illinois jury ruled Reckitt had failed to warn about the risks of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) from its milk-based Enfamil brand products.NEC is an illness that damages the stomach and tends to affect premature babies. Reckitt’s US subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition had been sued by Jasmine Watson, who claimed the baby formula caused the death of her premature baby.FTSE 100-constituent Reckitt has now been ordered to pay Ms Watson $60m (£47m) after losing the case.Ashley Keller, a lawyer for Ms Watson, said: “The jury’s finding confirms what Mead Johnson folks already knew – that its formula dramatically increases the NEC risk   “This is the first verdict in the US, but won’t be the last, unless baby formula makers accept responsibility for their misdeeds.”News of the decision sparked a near 20pc plunge in Reckitt’s share price, wiping around £7.3bn ($9.3bn) from its market value.It comes amid hundreds of US lawsuits against formula makers over NEC. The Illinois case was the first to go to a jury trial.Shares in Abbott Laboratories, another formula maker facing legal claims, fell almost 5pc. Jurors took less than two hours to decide that Mead Johnson should pay $60m in compensatory damages. Mr Keller said: “We only asked for $25m, but the jury came back with more than double that.”More than 400 suits targeting Mead Johnson and Abbott are consolidated before a federal judge in Chicago for pre-trial information exchanges. The judge hasn’t yet scheduled a trial. Thousands of other suits are pending in state courts, Mr Keller said.   Reckitt continues to insist its products are safe and not linked to NEC. It has vowed to appeal the Illinois case.NEC has a fatality rate of as much as 40pc. It is a major cause of death among premature babies, though rarely occurs in full-term babies.The disease, which affects intestinal tissues, can be hard to diagnose. According to the NHS, symptoms can include general signs of illness, problems feeding or vomiting, and a swollen and tender abdomen.While it has a high fatality rate, it can be treated with intravenous feeding and antibiotics. In some cases it can require surgery.Reckitt said in a stock market update that it stands by the safety of its products and “strongly rejects any assertion that any of our products cause NEC”.The company added: “It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.“This case, and others like it, exclusively involve products used under the strict supervision of neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units and provide lifesaving nutrition options for vulnerable premature infants.“We are, of course, surprised and deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned.”Reckitt is one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, pulling in revenues of £14.6bn in 2023. As well as Enfamil, it makes products such as Durex condoms, Cillit Bang cleaning fluid and Gaviscon.Nutrition brands account for about 16pc of its sales, contributing £2.4bn to its turnover last year.News of the Illinois jury’s decision marks the latest in a series of blows for the company, which last month revealed a £55m hit to revenues caused by an accounting controversy in the Middle East.Kris Licht, chief executive at Reckitt, said the company had unearthed “some commercial practices that we weren’t particularly pleased with”, leading to the dismissal of a number of employees.Reckitt in January recalled two baby formula products from sale in the UK amid concerns they could contain dangerous bacteria, in an event unrelated to the case in the US.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us on the blog today.

The biggest faller was Reckitt Benckiser, down 14.58pc, followed by tobacco giant Imperial Brands, down 2.56pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.14pc. The biggest riser was bus and train company Firstgroup, up 13.41pc, followed by supplier to the oil and gas industry Hunting, up 7.02pc. The biggest faller was Bank of Georgia, down 6.57pc, followed by telecom infrastructure company Helios Towers, down 6.28pc.Rolls-Royce is to expand its engine manufacturing capacity in the UK and Germany amid booming demand for overseas travel. Matt Oliver reports:The British engineering giant on Friday said it would increase its assembly, testing and shop capacity, to meet demand for its large engines and improve maintenance for those already in service.Over the rest of this decade, the company predicts the number of aircraft using its Trent family of turbofan engines to grow by as much as 9pc annually.As a result, Rolls is investing £55m and hiring 300 frontline workers to boost its operations in Derby and Dahlewitz, in Germany.About half of the investment and two thirds of the jobs will go to Derby, the company said.It will be used to expand the number of engines the company’s factory there can deliver per year by 40pc from 2025, while also increasing the number of engines that can undergo maintenance.Meanwhile, Rolls will take advantage of existing engine testing capabilities in Dahlewitz to temporarily meet extra maintenance demands before switching to assemble and test new Trent XWB-84 engines from 2026.It comes after the company vowed to invest £1bn in improvements to the Trent engine family.Last month Rolls revealed sales of its large aeroplane engines had surged to their highest level in 15 years.Major plans for gas-fired power stations that capture carbon took a key step forward today with the award of building contracts worth £4bn.The joint-venture scheme, led by British energy giant BP plus France’s TotalEnergies and Norway’s Equinor, forms part of the Government plans for a net zero carbon economy by 2050.The facilities, to be built in northern England by a date yet to be specified, come under the Net Zero Teesside Power and Northern Endurance Partnership banners.The pair on Friday said they had “selected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts with a combined value of around £4bn”. They added:The selection of nine leading specialist contractors ... is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK’s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.Up to two million tonnes of CO2 would be captured annually before being transported and securely stored in subsea sites beneath the North Sea.Companies awarded contracts included energy group Shell and infrastructure specialists Balfour Beatty.Friday’s announcement comes after Rishi Sunak’s administration this week pledged to build new gas-fired power stations to boost energy security.At the same time, the UK is rolling out low-carbon energies such as nuclear, solar and wind power in a strategy to combat sky-high domestic electricity and gas bills, which rocketed after key producer Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.Dettol maker Reckitt Benckiser has fallen 17pc this afternoon. It followed an Illinois jury ordering the company’s Mead Johnson division to pay $60m (£47m) to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company’s Enfamil baby formula.Shares plunged on fears that the consumer goods company would face more financial liabilities from lawsuits related to the baby formula.Reckitt told investors that it strongly disagreed with the jury’s decision.It said:We continue to believe that the allegations from the plaintiff’s lawyers in this case were not supported by the science or experts in the medical community … It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.Reckitt added that it was “deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned”.Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:It’s not simply the size of this payout which has caused nervousness, but the fact a long line of other lawsuits are pending, which could mount up to be a huge sum for the company.A Hong Kong-based activist investor has built up shares in Britain’s biggest sandwich maker after its share price fell by almost 50pc in the last five years. Daniel Woolfson reports:Oasis Management has acquired almost 5pc of the shares in Greencore, a major supplier of sandwiches and ready meals to the UK’s major supermarkets.Greencore produces 779m sandwiches a year and supplies Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.As well as sandwiches, it makes sushi, soups, packaged ready-meals and other chilled supermarket products. It employs around 13,600 people across the UK.Its shares have been languishing since the pandemic, falling more than 45pc over the last five years.Oasis has waged shareholder campaigns at a number of prominent consumer companies over recent years.A stake of almost 5pc of the company would make Oasis one of Greencore’s largest shareholders. It is understood that Oasis plans to continue buying shares. Once its stake rises above 5pc, it will be required to make a formal disclosure.Oasis’s European boss, Daniel Wosner, is understood to have met with executives at Greencore, the Financial Times, which first reported the news, said.Lenders to Thames Water’s parent company have reportedly hired advisers weeks before a £190m debt becomes due.Sky News says a syndicate of financiers have hired accountancy firm EY, amid concerns from regulators and politicians about the water company’s ability to survive.In December, Thames Water admitted to MPs that the holding company did not “currently” have the money to make the repayment due in April.Chris Weston, the newly appointed boss of Thames Water, has vowed to “restore confidence” in the business.He said:I recognise that this business is critical to both society and the UK and how important it is that we restore confidence in our operations and financial position.Thames Water declined to comment.Next is set to reveal higher profits for the past year as investors hope the clothing chain continues to shrug off customers’ cost-of-living pressures.The retailer has already upgraded its profit outlook five times over the past year as it has outperformed rivals amid a challenging economic backdrop.Shares in the company are trading at close to record highs as a result.The retailer is expected to reveal a 4pc increase in pre-tax profits to £905m for the year to January, in its latest update on Thursday next week.The group is also expected to reveal full-year sales growth of about 4pc against the previous year, taking sales to about £4.78bn.Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:Next gave investors plenty to be happy about in their last update, with growth of 9.1pc in its online channel helping sales to exceed group forecasts.While it may be winning the online race, the retail sector remains a tough place to operate.And with a history of under-promising and over-delivering, markets have come to have high expectations.American consumers have become slightly less optimistic about the world’s largest economy this month, although they continue to expect inflation to cool further.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, slipped to 76.5 in March according to preliminary figures, barely below February’s figure of 76.9. Americans’ outlook has essentially remained fixed since January, when it leapt higher.The consumer sentiment figure follows inflation reports this week that showed that, for a second straight month, prices rose at a pace faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2pc target.The consumer price index rose 3.2pc in February compared with a year ago, up from 3.1pc in January.Yet the University of Michigan report showed that Americans’ outlook for inflation hasn’t changed this month compared with February. Consumers expect inflation over the next year to be 3pc, the same as in the previous month.Alex Singleton is taking over now and will keep posting live updates into the evening. Thanks for joining me for another busy week of business news.I’m heading off as I’m starting to feel a little like Bill Gates did when he was pictured watching Carlos Alcaraz taking on Alexander Zverev at Indian Wells.He was lucky that the bees that attacked the tennis players wasn’t nearby.US industrial production ticked higher in February as an improvement in the weather helped boost manufacturing and mining, the Federal Reserve said, although earlier data was revised lower.Production rose 0.1pc in February following a revised fall of 0.5pc in January, the Fed announced.This was slightly above market expectations of no monthly change, but given the sharp downward revision for both December and January, the index remains lower than it was a year ago.Much of February’s rise was down to a 0.8pc rise in manufacturing output, and a 2.2pc increase in the index for mining.“Both gains partly reflected recoveries from weather-related declines in January,” the Fed said, adding that the “warmer-than-typical” month also helped push down the utilities index.High Frequency Economics’ chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi said: “Overall industrial production was slightly better than expected and manufacturing surprised to the upside in February.”She added that the manufacturing sector “continues to face headwinds from higher borrowing costs and tighter credit conditions.”US Industrial production edged up 0.1% in February after falling back 0.5% in January. The output of manufacturing rose 0.8% and mining rose 2.2%. Both reflect a rebound from the weather-induced declines in January. Output of utilities fell in February due to warmer temperatures. pic.twitter.com/In4GdCsVSj— Dr Thomas Kevin Swift (@DrTKSwift) March 15, 2024Contract workers at Northern Rail will strike on Saturday in a dispute over pay, union recognition and working conditions.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) employed by Carlisle Support Services will mount picket lines in Manchester, Leeds and Wigan.About 150 workers are involved in the dispute, including ticket barrier staff.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said:Our members are once again taking strike action against a company who has shown no regard for their staff and is not willing to settle this dispute.We will continue our industrial campaign until we can reach a negotiated settlement.Ultimately, the only, long-term solution is to end contracting out and bring the gateline contract back in house with all the benefits of direct employment from Northern.Oil held near a four-month high after industry chiefs forecast that the Opec cartel would maintain production cuts until the end of the year, resulting in a deficit in the global crude market.International benchmark Brent was down 0.5pc but still trading near $85 a barrel, after advancing 4.3pc over the previous two days.It reached its the highest level since November on Thursday after the International Energy Agency issued its deficit warning.Crude has also been supported this week by the first drop in US stockpiles since January, while Ukraine struck another Russian refinery.JD.com said that “following careful consideration, it does not intend to make an offer for Currys”.Representatives from the Chinese online shopping empire had made contact with the British retailer’s board and held exploratory talks in recent weeks but never made a formal offer.The discussions came as China’s biggest retailer seeks new sources of growth amid a sharp consumer slowdown at home.However, the Currys board indicated it was not prepared to be taken private at a discount, after rejecting two bids from US investor Elliott Management.The electricals retailer’s largest shareholder warned that more foreign corporates will start circling London companies.Redwheel, which holds 14.6pc of shares in Currys, said it was in “complete agreement” with the company’s board over their decision to reject a takeover offer from US hedge fund Elliott.A bidding war for Currys has been brought to a close after the Chinese suitor that had been circling the electricals retailer announced it would not make a bid.Currys shares sank 6pc after JD.com confirmed it does not intend to make an offer.It comes after the US hedge fund Elliott abandoned its attempt to take Currys private after two bids were rejected.Elliott said on Monday that it is “not in an informed position to make an improved offer for Currys on the basis of the public information available to it”.Shares sank on Wall Street today as a $5.3 trillion trading quirk triggered a sudden price swing.The Dow Jones was last down 0.4pc, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.6pc and the Nasdaq Composition has dropped 1.1pc as derivatives traders en masse face decisions about contracts that are scheduled to mature.Traders are forced to either roll over their positions or open new ones, but with $5.3 trillion of contracts scheduled to expire today it will trigger sharp changes in markets.The quarterly phenomenon affecting trades tied to stocks, index options and futures is known as “triple witching”.Rocky Fishman, founder of derivatives analytical firm Asym 500, said:It’s a day in which the direction of the market is very, very difficult to predict.On these big expiration days, the ‘internals’ get so skewed by the expiration that they don’t tell us anything.Therefore, it will be important that investors don’t use today’s action when trying to decipher what is going to happen in the marketplace next week and beyond.An English council has won a $490m (£384m) legal victory against Apple over claims the tech giant exaggerated demand for its iPhones.Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:Apple has agreed to pay shareholders the sum after settling with Norfolk County Council, which led a class action lawsuit against the company.The settlement comes after a five-year lawsuit claiming Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook had misled shareholders by neglecting to identify a downturn in demand in China weeks before a dramatic profit warning in 2019.The case was originally brought against Apple, Mr Cook, and chief financial officer Luca Maestri by the US city of Roseville.Norfolk Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020.Read how the legal battle unfolded.US stock markets fell at the open amid continuing uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate cuts.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc to 38,871.08, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6pc to 5,121.15.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8pc to 16,006.46.Britain homes could one day be powered by electricity generated in America under plans to install up to six power cables across the Atlantic.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:The cables would stretch roughly 3,500 miles across the ocean, reaching depths of up to 11,000 feet, and carrying power roughly equivalent to several nuclear power stations.A group of London investors and energy consultants are behind the ambitions scheme, as they claim technological advances in subsea cables could allow the creation of a global “intercontinental grid”.Simon Ludlam, one of the businessmen backing the project, says such a cable would enable electricity to be traded across the Atlantic, taking advantage of the differences in peak demand as the power line crosses time zones.This graphic shows how transatlantic power sharing works.The main US stock indexes were subdued in premarket trading after hotter-than-expected consumer prices and producer prices data.Wall Street was set to end slightly higher this week in spite of figures pointing to sticky inflation, which had sent the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond to a two-week high.Higher inflation adds pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates elevated, pushing traders to rein in bets of a June rate cut to 60pc from 73pc last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve’s meeting next week for hints on the timing of the central bank’s rate-easing cycle.Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank’s global head of economics and thematic research, said: “At the Fed, the big question next week is what they’ll signal in their new dot plot, and whether the median dot still points towards three cuts for 2024, as happened in December.”In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewas up 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.2pc.The Telegraph has won ministerial approval to appoint Mike McTighe as its chairman, as it faces the fallout from the failure of a takeover bid backed by the United Arab Emirates.Business editor Christopher Williams has the latest:Mr McTighe, 70, was previously chairman of Press Acquisitions Limited, the parent company of The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine.By becoming chairman of The Telegraph itself, it is expected he will become more closely involved in the day-to-day running of the company and the corporate, regulatory and political challenges posed by the continuing uncertainty over its ownership.Mr McTighe, who is also chairman of BT’s independent network arm Openreach and the FTSE 250 spread betting operator IG Group, said he would seek “clarity and certainty” for The Telegraph to enable it to “continue delivering consistently high-quality and fiercely independent editorial content”.Read on for details.A rail union is warning of possible industrial action against one of the country’s biggest train operators in a dispute over working arrangements for control room staff.The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) said strikes could be held by its members at South Western Railway (SWR) after the two sides failed to resolve a row over the “imposition” of changed working arrangements.The union has now served notice of the first stage of an official process which it warned could lead to industrial action.Gareth Theobald, TSSA organiser for SWR, said:This isn’t merely a shift in working patterns, it’s a stark deviation from well-established norms and we urge SWR to return to the negotiating table without delay to resolve this issue.It’s vital that the company understand the seriousness of the situation. We want to avoid industrial action and ensure the continued provision of rail services to the public.However, SWR should be in no doubt that if staff need to take action, then trains will come to a stop.The pound was set for its biggest weekly fall against the dollar since December, as investors became less certain about summer interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve amid stronger-than-anticipated inflation figures.The slide in sterling comes after a period of relative strength for the currency, which has gained this year on bets the Bank of England will keep rates higher for longer than its peers.However, the pound has been impacted by doubts over the Fed’s plans for its first rate cut, with traders now rating the chances of 54.7pc in June, down from 67pc before the data showed stronger-than-expected producer price inflation.Sterling was last broadly flat versus the dollar on the day at $1.27 but was on track for a 1pc weekly fall. The euro gained 0.1pc versus the pound to 85p.The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold at 5.25pc next Thursday, with market pricing favouring the Bank of England cutting rates slightly slower than the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve this year.The British public’s expectations for where inflation will be in a year’s time has fallen to its lowest level in three years amid hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer.The Bank of England’s inflation attitudes survey found that the average expectation of what the rate of inflation will be over the coming year was 3pc, down from 3.3pc in November last year.This was the lowest level since August 2021, before Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, triggering an energy inflation crisis across the globe.It comes as Russia holds national elections which Ukrainian defence intelligence (DIU) said would see Moscow mark ballot papers with the names of dead, missing and captured soldiers in order to boost Putin’s support.French shipping company CMA CGM has agreed to buy part of the media business owned by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, who holds a nearly 25pc stake in BT.CMA CGM’s chief executive Rodolphe Saade intends to create a large media conglomerate in France following the purchase of Altice Media, which owns leading French news channel BFM TV.Altice’s founder and owner Patrick Drahi said the deal would allow further investments into the group’s media such as BFM TV station and RMC radio station.The sales comes after the BT investor said last year that he “feels betrayed” over an alleged corruption scandal within his telecoms empire that triggered the arrest of his right-hand man.The French billionaire said that he was “shocked” after Portuguese authorities launched a criminal investigation into alleged corruption by individuals and senior executives within his sprawling media and telecoms group.BFM is France’s leading TV news channel, and says it has 12 million daily viewers.McDonald’s has apologised after it suffered an IT system outage in its British restaurants, which forced the closure of some sites and left customers unable to order food.The fast food giant insisted it was not hit by a cyber attack after consumers took to social media to complain of issues in several countries including the UK, Japan, China, Sweden and Australia.The Japanese arm of the chain apologised to customers on social media, telling them that they would have to “wait a while” amid the issues.“Many stores across the country have temporarily suspended operations. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers,” it posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.People in Australia, meanwhile, posted pictures of closed restaurants and signs alerting diners that McDonald’s could not accept orders.The cause of the outages is unknown, but it appears to be linked to the chain’s IT systems.Some stores were reported to be operating but only able to take cash orders.A McDonald’s spokesman said: “We are aware of a technology outage which impacted our restaurants. The issue has now been resolved in the UK and Ireland.“We thank customers for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. The issue is not related to a cybersecurity event.”McDonald’s customers have taken to social media to complain about the outage at the fast-food giant:Maccies can't even serve a latte this morning it's that digital there all closed 🤦🏻‍&male;️— Purple bin (@Purple_bin) March 15, 2024It happened in the UK too, I rocked up at work at 6am only to be told every Maccies in the country was broken. We're back now! https://t.co/ccpdJxgFEb— Genie the Gentlethem Pirate (they/them) (@Sprachstudentin) March 15, 2024something wrong with McDonalds? pic.twitter.com/UqSThoNG1i— simulacra deorum (@digitalfolklore) March 15, 2024McDonald’s has suffered a reported IT system outage in some of its restaurants, which has left customers unable to order food.Customers in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Japan complained about issues trying to buy from the fast food giant on social media.In Japan, the company apologised to customers on social media and said they may need to “wait a while” for problems to be resolved.In the UK, a number of customers said on social media that their local restaurants were closed although they were able to make orders through the company’s app.A McDonald’s Australia spokesman said it was “aware of a technology outage” currently impacting stores, according to the Daily Mail.Wholesale gas prices have climbed as the cost of permits for EU carbon emissions increased.Europe’s benchmark contract has jumped as much as 2.5pc to more than €26 per megawatt hour as the cost of carbon permits rose.The EU contract is the price that 11,000 power plants, steel foundries, and factories - covering 45pc of Europe’s greenhouse emissions - must pay for each tonne of carbon emitted under the “polluter pays principle”.The rising cost of the permits has made it more attractive for traders to buy gas rather than higher emitting coal, the price of which is on course for a fourth weekly gain.Meanwhile, the end of the winter means that Europe is beginning to rebuild supplies ahead of the next cold season.David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, warned that high insolvency levels “are unlikely to stop any time soon”. There were 2,102 company insolvencies in February, up 17pc on the same month a year earlier and up 18pc from January.Mr Hudson said:Rather than fresh starts, the spring brings with it additional challenges for already distressed businesses, particularly those in the strained retail and hospitality sectors.Despite hopes of some respite from the Chancellor in last week’s Budget, many will see large rises in their business rate bills from the start of April as well as having to shoulder increased wage costs as the new National Living Wage takes effect.While the positive view is that the UK’s recent recession was short-lived, factors like these – combined with increased borrowing costs and consumer confidence remaining weak – will continue to weigh heavily on UK plc.The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales has grown as businesses battle against high interest rates.Some 2,102 firms went under in February, up 17pc on the same month a year earlier and up 18pc from January.There were 10,136 individuals who declared insolvency in February, which was 23pc higher than in the same month in the previous year.European stock markets are on track for their strongest run in six years amid hopes for interest rate cuts.The Stoxx 600, which includes companies across Europe’s main markets, including the FTSE 100, is poised to notch an eighth consecutive weekly gain after hitting a series of record highs.If confirmed, it would be the longest run in six years, with the market boosted today by Vodafone’s announcement today that it is selling its Italian business for €8bn (£6.8bn) to Swisscom.It comes amid growing hopes for interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank over the summer.However, the Stoxx 600 was flat today amid stronger-than-expected US inflation figures put the brakes on the rate cut excitement.Sir Trevor Phillips, the broadcaster and chairman of Green Park executive recruitment organisation, has said his company’s clients think racism is common in the workplace.His recruitment company puts 500 people into executive level and boardroom jobs each year, a third of whome are from ethnic minorities and half of which are female.Sir Trevor told BBC Radio 4:If you have a woman in the room, it is far less likely that people are going to say dumb, sexist stuff.If you have a person from an ethnic minority in the room, it is far less likely they are going to say dumb, racist stuff.The fact that our clients regard this as important, tells us without a doubt that they know this kind of talk is commonplace and they would rather not have it.He added: “Nobody has a right to say dumb, racist stuff any more than they have a right to come into the office and gob on the carpet.”The FTSE 100 was little changed amid a downbeat mood on global markets after persistent US wholesale inflation created uncertainty about interest rate cuts.The exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged down 0.1pc, while the domestically-oriented FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc.Markets tracked dour sentiment from Wall Street and Asian equities, as higher-than-expected consumer and producer inflation readings dampened investor hopes of an early interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.Investors will now watch the Bank of England’s interest rate decision next week, where it is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 16-year highs of 5.25pc.Among individual stocks, Vodafone UK rose 4.2pc after Swisscom said it will buy Vodafone Italia for €8bn (£6.8bn) to merge the business with its Italian subsidiary Fastweb.British Airways owner IAG climbed as much as 4.6pc to lead the FTSE 100 after a double upgrade from BNP Paribas.Berkeley Homes expects to make £1.5bn of pre-tax profits over the next three years as the property sector moves past the woes caused by high interest rates.The developer said in a trading update that it expects to make a profit of £550m this financial year - as analysts had expected - despite sales rates remaining around a third lower than the previous year.It said it will return £227m to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks by the end of September.Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the company is “sitting on solid ground” as its focus on London and higher-end homes paid off. He said:While markets aren’t forecasting much of an uplift in the housing market in 2024, there are some early signs that pressures are beginning to ease for housebuilders.Mortgage rates have fallen from peak levels, real wages are growing and build-cost inflation has pulled back, giving some relief to industry margins.Berkeley’s also sitting on a hefty chunk of cash, so there’s plenty of scope for continued shareholder returns through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.Berkeley Homes shares fell 0.3pc in early trading.The FTSE 100 was flat as trading began following uncertainty that also gripped Wall Street and Asian markets following mixed US economic figures on Thursday.The UK’s blue-chip index began the day little changed at 7,743.96 while the midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc to 19,531.84.Bitcoin has dropped back sharply from its recent record high amid fears the latest surge in cryptocurrencies is a bubble.The world’s largest digital token fell more than 5pc in the Asian session to bottom at $66,629.96. It was last down 3.9pc at $68,644.80.The choppy moves in the world’s largest cryptocurrency came a day after its charge to a high of $73,803.25, setting a new record for a fourth straight day.Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett told Bloomberg TV that markets are showing the characteristics of a bubble.He pointed to the surge in the technology sector’s so-called Magnificent Seven stocks and the all-time highs in crypto.Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, said:Bitcoin has an established history of getting volatile and ruthless after hitting (a) record high.And not only did it recently hit a new high, but it looks like the (Federal Reserve) won’t be as dovish as traders had hoped.China’s property crisis took another turn for the worse as home prices continued to fall last month.Both new and used home prices declined in February compared to a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidised housing, fell 1.9pc from a year earlier, steeper than January’s 1.2pc drop.Meanwhile, existing-home prices dropped 5.2pc, worsening from 4.5pc fall in January across all 70 cities.China has been grappling a post-pandemic economic downturn that has led to a significant slump in property investment across the country, which has led to a slowdown in growth.One of China’s biggest housebuilders, Evergrande, collapsed in 2021, which spooked the whole market. Other developers have also been going bust.Vodafone has confirmed the sale of its Italian business to Swisscom for €8bn (£6.8bn), weeks after rejecting an approach by French billionaire Xavier Niel.The British telecoms giant also announced a €4bn (£3.4bn) share buyback plan.The Swiss company said in a statement that it would merge Vodafone Italia with its own Italian subsidiary, Fastweb.It marks the latest deal pursued by Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle as she looks to trim the sprawling telecoms giant and return it to growth.The company has recently agreed a £15bn deal to merge with Three in the UK, creating the country’s largest mobile network.Ms Della Valle said:Today, I am announcing the third and final step in the reshaping of our European operations.Going forward, our businesses will be operating in growing telco markets - where we hold strong positions - enabling us to deliver predictable, stronger growth in Europe.

2024-03-15T14:10:43.000Z,UPDATE 3-Apple reaches $490 mln settlement over CEO Cook's China sales comments,"(Edits first paragraph, adds plaintiffs' law firm)By Jonathan StempelMarch 15 (Reuters) - Apple agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged Chief Executive Tim Cook defrauded shareholders by concealing falling demand for iPhones in China.A preliminary settlement was filed on Friday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.It stemmed from Apple's unexpected announcement on Jan. 2, 2019 that the iPhone maker would slash its quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, blaming U.S.-China trade tensions.Cook had told investors on an Nov. 1, 2018, analyst call that although Apple faced sales pressure in markets such as Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey, where currencies had weakened, ""I would not put China in that category.""Apple told suppliers a few days later to curb production.The lowered revenue forecast was Apple's first since the iPhone's launch in 2007. Shares of Apple fell 10% the next day, wiping out $74 billion of market value.Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.The Cupertino, California-based company denied liability, but settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, court papers show.Shawn Williams, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the shareholders, called the settlement an ""outstanding result"" for the class.The settlement covers investors who bought Apple shares in the two months between Cook's comments and the revenue forecast.Apple posted $97 billion of net income in its latest fiscal year, and its payout equals a little under two days of profit.Last June, Rogers refused to dismiss the lawsuit.She found it plausible to believe Cook had been discussing Apple's sales outlook and not currency changes, and said Apple knew China's economy was slowing and demand could fall.The lead plaintiff is the Norfolk County Council as Administering Authority of the Norfolk Pension Fund, located in Norwich, England.Lawyers for the shareholders may seek fees of up to 25% of the settlement amount.Apple's share price has more than quadrupled since January 2019, giving the company a more than $2.6 trillion market value.The case is In re Apple Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-02033.

2024-03-15T19:59:24.000Z,Norfolk County Council secures settlement as Apple agrees £384m lawsuit payment,"Norfolk County Council has secured a settlement in a lawsuit against Apple, with the tech giant agreeing to pay 490 million dollars (£384 million) in a “tremendous result”.The lawsuit alleged Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook misled investors about iPhone sales in China between November 2018 and January the following year.The preliminary settlement filed in the US District Court in Oakland, northern California, will need final approval from a judge at a further hearing.The class action – made on behalf of a group of claimants including investors in Apple – was led by Norfolk Council, which said its pension fund was affected by the company’s alleged actions.A spokesperson for the Norfolk Pension Fund said: “We are proud of this recovery for investors.“We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals.“When and where it’s warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants’ investments are harmed by fraud.”The Oakland court’s judgment said: “The settlement is a tremendous result for the class.”According to the document, Norfolk Council became the “lead plaintiff” in June 2020 and alleged that Apple “made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about demand for the newly-released iPhones and Apple’s business in China” contrary to the Securities Exchange Act 1934.The complaint further alleged “false and misleading statements and omissions” caused Apple’s stock to trade at “artificially inflated prices” before the stock price declined when the “true facts” were disclosed.Mr Cook indicated during an investor conference call in November 2018 that iPhone sales in China were performing well, according to the complaint.In January the following year, the chief executive warned Apple’s revenue for the quarter would drop nine billion dollars (£7.09 billion) below what was predicted – with almost all of the fall found to be down to poor demand in China.It led to the company’s stock price diving 10% in the next day of frenetic trading and cut shareholder wealth by more than 70 billion dollars (£55 billion).Apple denied Mr Cook deceived investors about the phone’s sales in China in that period.“Defendants (Apple) have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this action,” the Oakland judgment made clear.“But in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive and distracting have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action.”The parties accepted a mediator’s proposal to settle on March 1.Norfolk Council will receive a portion of the settlement.Apple recorded 97 billion dollars (£76 billion) in profit in its last fiscal year.

2024-03-15T13:02:36.000Z,English council wins £400m payout from Apple,"An English council has won a $490m (£384m) legal victory against Apple over claims the tech giant exaggerated demand for its iPhones.Apple has agreed to pay shareholders the sum after settling with Norfolk County Council, which led a class action lawsuit against the company.The settlement comes after a five-year lawsuit claiming Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook had misled shareholders by neglecting to identify a downturn in demand in China weeks before a dramatic profit warning in 2019.The case was originally brought against Apple, Mr Cook, and chief financial officer Luca Maestri by the US city of Roseville. Norfolk Council, which administers the £4.9bn Norfolk Pension Fund, took over the lawsuit as lead plaintiff in 2020.The payout is set to be shared by investors who apply for damages and say they were affected by Apple allegedly misleading investors. It is unclear how much the Norfolk pension fund itself will receive.The lawsuit had claimed that Mr Cook misled shareholders as Apple faced a drop in demand after the release of the iPhone XS and XR in 2018.Mr Cook said in late 2018 that while Apple was “seeing pressure” in some emerging markets, “I would not put China in that category”.Two months later Apple unveiled a rare profit warning that blamed weakness in China, leading to shares being briefly suspended and $55bn being wiped off the company’s value.Apple and its executives had challenged the case ahead of a trial, which had been scheduled for later this year. Dozens of Apple emails had been released as part of the lawsuit discussing the company’s business in China, while executives had been questioned ahead of the case.In legal filings, lawyers for Norfolk Council say the settlement “is a tremendous result” and the third-largest amount recovered in a class action of this type in Northern California.They said that Apple continues to deny it had violated US stock market rules or misled investors.“Defendants have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this Action, but in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive, and distracting, have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action,” the filings said.Lawyers will receive up to 25pc of the payout, which will now have to be approved by a judge.A spokesman for the Norfolk Pension Fund, said: “We are proud of this recovery for investors.

2024-03-15T09:40:00.000Z,"Better ""Magnificent Seven"" Buy: Nvidia vs. Apple Stock","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are a group of megacap technology companies that have thrived over the past few years and led this new bull market, but it's not been a smooth ride for every member of that group.Two key members, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), are moving in opposite directions so far in 2024. Apple's stock price has fallen 10% since January, while Nvidia's has risen over 80%.So, which one of these two stocks is the better buy going forward?2024 hasn't been kind to the personal electronics giant. The iPhone maker has fallen more than 10% since January. Why? It's most likely due to declining growth expectations. Apple's revenue growth has slowed significantly, which analysts expect will trickle down to slower earnings growth.Additionally, word out of China is that iPhone sales there are slipping. According to research by Counterpoint, iPhone sales were down 24% year over year in China through the first six weeks of the year, as consumers pass on iPhones for Chinese alternatives.Now, Apple is still a marvelous company. Investing legend Warren Buffett has called it the best business his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns. Apple makes up over 40% of Berkshire's $363 billion stock portfolio. However, it is understandable that Apple faces questions about its long-term growth. Growing isn't always easy for a massive $2.6 trillion company.On the other hand, Nvidia has been growing shockingly fast. The company is benefiting from a surge of investments related to AI. Nvidia's AI chips are today's dominant market leader, with an estimated 80% market share. That's shown up in fascinating financial results that have seen Nvidia's revenue and profits go parabolic, launching the stock higher in the process.The big question is whether this is a burst or a prolonged trend. Lisa Su, the CEO of Nvidia's competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, believes the AI chip market will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. Considering Nvidia's companywide revenue is still ""just"" $61 billion as the market leader, there's a lot of potential upside if this prediction comes true.Investors might be understandably shy toward a stock that has risen so much so fast. However, the fundamentals have (so far) seemingly justified Nvidia's price action. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. For starters, Nvidia does tons of business with relatively few deep-pocketed customers. Losing any of them could put a big dent in revenue. It remains to be seen if AMD and other chip companies can encroach on Nvidia's market share over the coming years.Choosing between these two investments depends on whether you believe Apple is more likely to rebound or if Nvidia will run out of steam. Looking at fundamentals, Nvidia has a clear advantage. I like using the PEG ratio to gauge how much I pay for a stock's earnings growth. In other words, how much bang for your buck are you getting?Comparing the two stocks below reveals a clear winner:CompanyForward P/E RatioExpected Long-Term Average Annual EPS GrowthPEG RatioApple26.09.4%2.7Nvidia35.634.8%1.0Data source: Ycharts. EPS = earnings per share.Lower is better for the PEG ratio. I generally like buying stocks with a PEG ratio of 1.5 or less. As you can see above, Apple is far more expensive than Nvidia for the growth analysts expect over the long term.Could Nvidia fall short of analyst estimates? Could Apple outperform its expectations? Of course!But the gap is so vast today that it's hard to justify picking Apple over Nvidia, especially when the company puts up the financials to justify the hype the stock is getting. That makes Nvidia the better Magnificent Seven stock to buy until proven otherwise.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-09T20:30:00.000Z,EV Stocks Are Dropping Like Flies – This “Bug” Is Still Worth Looking At,"Hello, Reader.A once-mighty Titan has fallen.No, not one of the pre-Olympian gods defeated by Zeus and his friends during the “Titanomachy”…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNor the monster “Kraken” from the 1981 film Clash of the Titans…It’s Apple’s electric vehicle aspiration, Project Titan. Through Project Titan, Apple Inc. (AAPL) sought to create an electric vehicle with AI-equipped features and self-driving capabilities. While rumors abounded, the company kept the details well-hidden since the project launched in 2014. Development picked up in 2018, but then finally ran into wall last week.Like the builders of the Titanic, Apple probably tempted fate by naming its EV project after an immortal deity. Project Titan perished after just ten years.Apple, itself, may be a true titan, but not a miracle-worker. The EV industry is claiming many victims these days. Earnings and revenue are declining at Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and the share prices of former EV hopefuls like Nikola Corp. (NKLA), Canoo Inc. (GOEV), and Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) are sliding into a ditch. Suffice to say, it’s becoming more and more difficult to find quality EV opportunities. Electric vehicles remain an unstoppable trend, however, and continue to provide investment opportunities.That’s why I’m sticking with my top pick in the EV space.In today’s Smart Money, I’ll take a look at why I still like this company as an EV play today…And at another EV-themed investment that may have even greater profit potential…The company – Volkswagen AG (VWAGY) – makes no secret of its ambition to become the world’s preeminent EV company… and it is making rapid progress toward that goal.The ID.4 SUV, VW’s first-ever U.S.-made battery electric vehicle (BEV), was the first fruit of the legendary German automaker’s ambitious expansion plans in the U.S. market. The company expects 55% of U.S. sales to be fully electric by 2030.Over the next five years, Volkswagen plans to invest a hefty $76 billion in global EV production and battery technology, including $7 billion to expand U.S. production and $17 billion to expand its market-leading presence in China. No other major automaker – no less the likes of Nikola or Rivian – is spending close to that amount. Volkswagen is also investing heavily to develop an open fast-charging network worldwide. By 2025, the company and its partners expect to install 45,000 High Power Charging points in Europe, China, and the United States.Last year, the Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, Porsche and a few other brands, sold a record 771,000 BEVs last year – 35% more than it sold in 2022. That figure represented just 8.3% of its total car sales. So, plenty of room for growth remains.Looking further down the road, Volkswagen believes software-based services will generate one-third of revenues in the global mobility market by 2030. For this reason, it is developing proprietary software expertise.As the company explains…Over the coming years, the Group’s own software and technology company CARIAD will develop the new E3 2.0 software platform for all Group vehicles and thus exploit synergy effects across all the brands… The new software architecture enables a complete ecosystem, which will offer customers a host of software-based services throughout the full product life cycle. By 2030, the Volkswagen Group will put up to 40 million of its cars based on the new software stack on the streets of this world. The Group will have the largest amount of real-time data in the whole industry – and continuously improve its products on this basis.Volkswagen’s grand BEV ambitions are not merely an attempt to transition successfully to the next phase of human mobility. They are also an attempt to establish a new phase of robust profitability for the company.Volkswagen is also heartily investing in battery technology to gain an advantage over its rivals.In July 2022, the company created PowerCo, a 100%-owned subsidiary, to produce battery components in European factories. The company’s aim is to manage the entire process, “From processing raw materials to developing a unified Volkswagen battery to managing the European gigafactories.” Lithium is, of course, one of the main raw materials that lithium-ion EV batteries require.This is why a recent discovery in Nevada –an ancient supervolcano holding a vast quantity of lithium – could become a vital cog in the global EV supply chain.Early reports suggest that the rich sediment from the supervolcano’s eruption millions of years ago could hold enough lithium to last 100 years at current projections… and enough to potentially be worth $1 trillion, an opportunity that could produce a major investment opportunity.Click here to find out the company that is set to profit from this discovery.Regards,Eric FryP.S.

2024-03-15T18:44:28.000Z,Apple acquires AI startup specializing in overseeing manufacturing components,"Apple has added another AI startup to its acquisition list with Canada-based DarwinAI, which specializes in vision-based tech to observe components during manufacturing to improve efficiency, Bloomberg reported.While Apple and DarwinAI haven't announced this deal, several members of the startup's team joined Apple's machine learning teams in January, as per their LinkedIn profiles.DarwinAI had raised over $15 million in funding across various rounds from investors, including BDC Capital’s Deep Tech Venture Fund, Honeywell Ventures, Obvious Ventures and Inovia Capital. BDC Capital confirms on its website that it has received an exit from DarwinAI, whereas Obvious Ventures has updated its portfolio to reflect that the startup has been acquired.BDC Capital and Obvious Ventures didn't comment on the story at the time of writing. We have reached out to Apple for a comment, and we will update the story if we get a response.As Bloomberg noted in its report, apart from helping with manufacturing efficiency, DarwinAI uses techniques to make AI models smaller and faster. This could be useful for on-device generative AI features Apple hopes to introduce in iOS 18 this year.Apple has lagged in releasing GenAI-powered features as compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta and Microsoft. In February, Tim Cook said the company plans to introduce such features ""later this year.""“We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Cook said during a quarterly earnings call with analysts.Last year the Apple CEO had confirmed investment into GenAI efforts. Apple's job listings have suggested the company is exploring infusing AI in multiple internal and external areas, including, Siri, developer tools and customer support.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-in-overlooking-manufacturing-components/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-acquires-ai-startup-specializing-040605041.html
2024-03-16T15:19:59.000Z,15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most,"In this article, we will be analyzing the population dynamics in the US and the 15 US cities where the population decreased the most. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most.The United States ranks among the most populous countries worldwide. As reported by the US Census Bureau, the country’s population is 336,167,022, as of March 14. Region-wise, the South accounted for 38.9% of the population growth in 2023. Population growths of 23.6% for the West, 20.6% for the Midwest, and 17% for the Northeast were reported in 2023. Some of the most populous US states include California, Texas, Florida, and New York. You can also take a look at the most densely populated cities in the US.2022 showed the first signs of US recovery from the global pandemic in terms of population growth. This was when the US population was reported to have increased by 0.4%. The primary driver of this growth was the net international migration which added 1,010,923 people to the national population.Future prediction represents a slow-paced population growth for the country over the coming years. On November 9, 2023, the US Census Bureau reported that the US population has been forecasted to approach almost 370 million in 2080 before moving downward to 366 million in 2100. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth. Simultaneously, a natural decrease in the country’s population will be supported by declining fertility rates and an aging population. The reduced fertility rates will also impact the nation’s age structure, leading to more adults aged 65 and above as compared to children under the age of 18.One year into the pandemic, the US Census Bureau reported that some of the fastest-growing US cities during the pre-pandemic period, witnessed slower growth rates after the pandemic. Population growth especially slowed in the cities of Leander in Texas and Meridian in Idaho.With respect to the fastest declining cities, San Fransisco ranked at the top in 2021 when it was not even a part of the list in 2019. Even for the city of Cupertino which had been a declining city in both 2019 and 2021, the drop in its population growth was almost triple. Overall, six of the top fifteen declining cities were based in California. The largest numeric decrease in population was recorded in New York City, San Fransisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles.A recent study reveals that almost half of the 30,000 US cities will be subject to depopulation by 2100. This study initially began as a project commissioned by the Illinois Department of Transportation to carry out an analysis of the challenges in transportation that could arise from population changes in Illinois. However, a deeper analysis showed that the biggest population losses will be taking place in the Northeast and Midwest of the country as the population moves to the South and West. States such as Texas and Utah where the population tends to be growing as of now, will be seeing a fair share of their cities undergoing depopulation in the future. The population will also be declining in the cities situated in Illinois, Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Michigan. Overall, some sort of depopulation has been forecasted for all US states except for the District of Columbia and Hawaii.California is home to a majority of cities where the population has decreased the most in recent years. It is an important US state in terms of business as well. The state boasts a robust technology sector. Some of the dominant technology firms in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to. Some of the biggest California companies and stocks have also been previously discussed.The tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is headquartered in Cupertino, California. Recently, the company made a development in the laptop space and launched a new and  more powerful MacBook Air. On March 4, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that the new 13- and 15‑inch MacBook Air will be available beginning March 8. Using the powerful M3 chip, the MacBook Air tends to be up to 60% faster than the model having an M1 chip. It also ranks as the world’s best consumer laptop for AI while allowing up to 18 hours of battery life. Based on the improved performance and features, the 13-inch model serves as the bestselling laptop globally while the 15-inch model is the bestselling 15-inch laptop around the world.The Palo Alto-based HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) offers more than 100 AI-enabled solutions under its artificial intelligence portfolio. On March 7, the company unveiled the industry’s largest portfolio of AI PCs. This includes HP Elite PCs which serve as the leading business laptops for collaboration in the world, and Z by HP mobile workstations. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has also announced program enhancements for channel partners under which they will now be capable of accessing the first role-based AI partner training and certification program.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another California-based technology company that is enabling the penetration of generative AI, an emerging tech trend. On March 7, the company reported the introduction of a new professional certification in generative AI. Developers and professionals can polish their proficiency in AI through this professional certification program from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which encompasses two associate-level generative AI certifications. The certification will focus on large language models and multimodal workflow skills.

2024-03-16T14:15:00.000Z,"This Warren Buffett ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Is Riskier Than You Think","Many of you are aware of Warren Buffett's legendary investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). He and his lieutenants started buying shares in 2016 and 2017 for Berkshire Hathaway, making it the largest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio. Today, the stake is worth an estimated $175 billion. Shares are up over 500% since the beginning of 2017, making the Apple investment one of Buffett's best purchases ever.But just because Apple has done well in the past does not mean it will do well in the future. There are looming risks with this ""Magnificent Seven"" favorite that I believe are underappreciated by investors right now. Here's why Apple stock remains risky for investors to own in 2024.The first concern with Apple is broad-based: Revenue is stagnating. Despite high inflation around the world in the last few years, Apple's revenue on a trailing-12-month basis is actually down from the middle of 2022. Adjusted for inflation, this means that Apple's sales have taken quite a hit in the last few years.The only hardware segment that grew sales in fiscal Q1 2024 was the iPhone, hitting $70 billion in revenue for the holiday quarter compared to $66 billion a year prior. This business should remain solid for Apple if it can continue to raise prices, but unit sales for smartphones have stagnated for years. The days of hyper-growth for the iPhone are likely over.So how can Apple increase its revenue? Setting aside its burgeoning services segment, Apple needs to find another hardware device that can drive sales. It certainly won't be the iPad, Watch, or Mac segments, which serve as either niche or adjacent products to the iPhone. But what about the Vision Pro mixed reality headset? It launched earlier this year and sports a $3,500 price tag. If Apple can start selling a lot of Vision Pros, this could drive growth over the next decade.The problem is that the Vision Pro looks like a flop. A lot of buyers are returning their devices, with many saying they have stopped using it regularly. Time will tell, but so far it looks like the Vision Pro is far from the next iPhone. To drive sales growth for a company like Apple, the Vision Pro will have to become a global hit. That has not happened with its first iteration and is likely many years away from happening, if it ever does.Stagnant revenue isn't the only concern for Apple. There are major looming risks from government regulations that could eliminate some of its historical cash cows.First, the Chinese government is increasing its oversight and regulations against Apple products. It is widening the iPhone ban across governmental agencies as the East Asian giant expands its conflict with Apple's home country, the United States. Last quarter, 17.4% of Apple's sales came from China. If this goes away, it would be a major hit to Apple's income statement.Some investors might argue that Apple's services segment will drive growth. It has in the past and is now a much larger part of the business. Last fiscal year, services brought in $85 billion in high-margin revenue from things like Apple Music, the App Store, and AppleTV+. The issue is that governments are attacking Apple's App Store and distribution payments from Google.We are seeing increasing regulatory attention focused on the App Store. The E.U. just fined Apple around $2 billion solely for being anticompetitive in the music streaming business. Multiple governments are debating whether to pass regulation against the App Store and its 30% take rate on digital transactions, which generates a ton of high-margin revenue for Apple each year.Perhaps more important is Apple's distribution payment that it receives from Google Search each year. It is estimated that the search giant pays Apple upwards of $20 billion just to be the default search engine on Apple devices. This is basically pure profit and would make up a large chunk of the Mac maker's $118 billion in annual operating earnings. The courts in the United States are debating whether this payment from Google is anticompetitive. If they decide it is, $20 billion in annual earnings could be immediately wiped away from Apple's income statement.If we look at Apple's stock price, it shows that the company's valuation is not very attractive for a low-growth operation. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 27, which is right around the market average but still sits at a premium to faster-growing companies like Alphabet, the parent of Google Search.And these trailing earnings do not take into account any future headwinds from China, a Vision Pro flop, or the potential steep reduction in high-margin services revenue. Add everything together, and Apple may be the riskiest Magnificent Seven stock to own in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-16T04:24:40.000Z,Q2 2024 Zedge Inc Earnings Call,"Brian Siegel; IR; Zedge, Inc.Jonathan Reich; CEO, President; Zedge, Inc.Yi Tsai; Treasurer, CFO; Zedge, Inc.Allen Klee; Analyst; Maxim Group LLCOperatorGood morning, everyone.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to your host, Brian Siegel, the floor is yours.Brian SiegelThank you, operator.

Any forward-looking statements made during this conference call during the prepared remarks or in the question-and-answer session.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to specific risks and uncertainties disclosed in the reports Zedge parent periodically files with the SEC assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to update the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that they forecast. Please note that our earnings release is available on the Investor Relations page of this EDGE website. The earnings release has also been filed on Form 8-K with the SEC. I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.Jonathan ReichGood morning. Thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin by briefly reviewing our second quarter results, demonstrating how our fiscal year 2023 investments have positioned us for sustainable long-term growth. Q2 revenue increased 11% from last year as we continued managing the geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry specific challenges spanning the landscape. One of the big stories this past quarter was continued momentum at the Zedge marketplace. Ad revenue was up 18% from last year. Zedge plus our marketplace subscription offering delivered exciting results with revenue increasing 24% from last year with small net subscriber gains sequentially and less than 1% net subscriber loss year over year. And Zedge Premium revenue driven by several improvements to content monetization and other back-end front-end items was up 21%. These factors fueled a 37% increase in the average revenue per monthly active user or RPU. Now to a record $0.072, and this strength was not just on Android as IOS revenue for the Zedge marketplace was up an impressive 46% sequentially. I should add that many of these trends are holding up at the halfway point of our fiscal third quarter. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we said building a full-stack marketing team would be our key corporate-wide initiative similar to what we accomplished with data analytics in fiscal 2023. We're well on our way here, and our efforts are starting to bear fruit especially for the Zevex marketplace. Another important story this quarter relates to maturing our product development organization to drive innovation to accelerate product diversification and consolidate resources to ensure long-term success to that end, we have assembled an all-star team of seasoned gaming experts who are alumni of the leading mobile gaming publishers and have turned them loose on shots. Their mandate is to unleash the growth that was core to our investment thesis at the time of the acquisition. This team is already sprinting having overhauled the product roadmap with four major focus areas. The first is teacher development, which hasn't been given the attention it deserves since the acquisition in the past, successful new features would yield a 10% to 30% jump in revenues with little or no downside when they didn't take hold. The updated product roadmap is full of new features designed to drive revenue and make guru shots more accessible to an even broader audience. Next, our decision to focus on innovation will allow us to drive user growth by investing our marketing dollars more efficiently. Specifically, we will better a couple grew chasses UA spend with feature releases. In January, we introduced turbo feature that expands the gameplay and improves game resource consumption. To date, it has yielded a 15% increase in average daily revenue, giving me confidence that we are on the right track. Traditionally, we are about to release another new feature flash challenges, a short duration photo challenge that limits the number of participants per challenge and provides even more opportunities for users to win. We believe that this dynamic will drive up engagement to make food shops more accessible to a broader set of players, both existing and new. In parallel, the team is reinventing the game economy by converting to a coin based economy supporting multiple currencies and foregoing the existing autonomy, which we believe is too rigid and limited in terms of the number of ways players can earn and spend in-game resources. This change will open an array of customer value ads. For example, we will be able to reward all players with game currency and manage resource consumption in a fashion that optimizes further coin purchases, creating a comprehensive and inviting on-boarding funnel is also a key focus area for the grooming shops, game insured onboarding will enable newbies to immediately experience gameplay in a simplified manner with a limited number of competitors increasing their chances of winning the funnel will allow players to progress with more features and increased complexity based on individual performance, enabling skill-based user segmentation, which will be a win for the user base. I want to add that we believe these efforts taken in concert with one another will help us deliver growth, which was one of the key theses of the acquisition through shots is the leading photo competition game and more than 150 million photos have been used to play. The game photography continues growing exponentially due to the ubiquity of mobile phones and with the advent of AI enhancements, high quality pictures are within everyone's reach. The gameplay is fine and it touches on the human interface. Safety for people like to have fun, compete and win with all the opportunities we have in the pipeline. I think we are at a turning point and I look forward to sharing details as they unfold. Moving to the Zedge marketplace our success in growing advertising revenue in recent quarters stems from our continuous optimization efforts, combined with highly effective paid UA programs are driving positive roll offs in 90 days or less Additionally, over the past two quarters, we began improving our IOS monetization stack by optimizing ads and rolling out Zedge plus for IOS, which, along with paint contributed to strong iOS revenue growth. Overall, the iOS ecosystem remains a largely untapped opportunity for us, and we continuously look at ways most recently AI to unlock it and capitalize on our brand to drive growth motor PTO had another good quarter. Our previous investments in website redesign, localization and technology upgrades continued to pay off and lay the foundation for the next phase of growth with new features and content expected to be rolled out in the quarters to come. Taken together, we continue to believe that we have never been in a better position to create sustainable long-term profitable growth given the combination of market opportunity, our current product portfolio and roadmap, our marketing prowess, data capabilities, tech stack, and most importantly, our team. Furthermore, we are not just talking about AI. We have already integrated it throughout our business, including product technology and marketing. And now I would like to turn the call over to Yi, who will review our financial results. Yi?Yi TsaiYes. Thank you, Jonathan. As you saw in our earnings release, GAAP requires us to take a one-time $11.9 million non-cash write-down of goodwill charges, intangible asset. It's important to underscore that this was a non-cash event dictated by time as current performance demand line with a carrying value in the loan book. As Jonathan indicated, we still believe that with time, we will unlock growth and achieve the strategic goals that we envisioned when we acquire closure. Additionally, this write-down does not reflect the valuable gamification experience we secure benefiting the rest of our business as a result of the strain related to variation. Over the past year, we have added non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as new metrics that we plan to report going forward. The reconciliation for GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our earnings release from this morning. Monthly active users on now for the debt marketplace decreased 10.7% from a year ago to $28.8 million. Now in well developed market and emerging market were down 15.6% and 9.2%, respectively. Total revenue in the second quarter was $7.8 million, up 11% from last year due to the goods and services, which encompasses revenue from Korea, came in at $0.9 million, down 26% from last year. Similar to Q1, GuruShots revenue was again negatively impacted by Apple's ATT framework, macro economic issues and the geopolitical situations. Subscription revenue for the second quarter was up 24% versus last year. Additionally, this metric was up sequentially for the third straight quarter as our net active subscriber trend improved and higher-value IOS attrition and our new value add exist Plus offering for Android replace lower cost legacy subscription, which only remove it net premiums. Gross transaction value or GTV, grew 23% from last year to a record $540,000, reflecting higher price per advertising impression and incremental revenue generated from payments, which offset modest decline in other content sales. It was a record [$0.072], up 37% year over year, reflecting stability in our pricing and a positive impact of our new IOS Android. Subscription cost of revenue declined by 27% and was 5.9% of revenue. SG&A increased by 11% to $6.5 million. GAAP loss from operation, including the impact of the $11.9 million write off was $11.9 million versus income from operation of $1.5 million last year. GAAP net loss and loss per share for Q2 was $9.2 million or $0.66 versus income and EPS of $1.6 million and $0.11, respectively in a prior year. Non-gaap net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.5 million and $0.04 versus $0.8 million and $0.06 in the prior year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million versus $1.4 million in the prior year. From a liquidity standpoint, we remain in a strong cash position with over $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, not every pay down the $2 million in outstanding bank loan during the quarter. Thank you for listening to our second quarter earnings call. And I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in mid June. Operator, back to you for Q&A.Operator(Operator Instructions) Allen Klee, Maxim Group.Allen KleeCongratulations on the strong revenue growth from my first question is you had record advertising rates, but it's also your seasonally strongest quarter, I think. So. Can we parse out how to think about maybe to some degree what effect is seasonal versus the other stuff?Brian SiegelHi, Allen. Thanks so much for your comments. And as I mentioned in my earlier summary of the quarter, we're actually seeing that our comm halfway through the quarter numbers are holding up. So that is due to a combination of factors, both speaker wise as tech winds or ad stack was high as well as I guess, some secular features or some such secular factors. So it's a little bit hard to sort of parse that out because by contrast typically our Q3 is our weakest quarter from an ad revenue perspective in light of post season drop-off in ad budgets and so on and so forth.Allen KleeThat's great. Thank you. And then just, in terms of the marketplace, I think you said that paint and there's greater functionality on the web and gross transactional value sold was up like 23%. Is there a way to think about what the key drivers are of them have growth in marketplace and things that you're doing keep us going?Brian SiegelSure. Just to be more specific, are you talking about Zedge Premium? Are you talking about the overall marketplace, which includes not only licensed content but also user-generated content?Allen KleeFor both.Brian SiegelWell, right. When you take a look at Zedge Premium, which is the licensed content area. We continue to iterate Teun Optimiz. And as a result, you're seeing the improvements there. We are also and now beginning to think about what can that market, what converged premium look like with the expansion across web and in terms of the overall Zedge app are global in that marketplace it's a function of continually adding and optimizing features that we have as well as improving the user experience. There's work that can be done on the user experience. One of the areas that we're beginning to look into now relates to us onboarding. In the past, we've talked about our recommendations on the content that served up to users. How does that impact on the user experience and then projects around improving engagement and retention. So in our totality, each of those contributes up to the results that we reported today and then separate and apart from that, as I mentioned, the work that we had done last year in terms of overhauling the Zedge plus subscription on Android and rolling out Z plus subscription on IOS for the first time, it has also yielded very positive results for us.Allen Klee(multiple speakers) Yes. Thank you, Al. Just so we understand, is it Zedge plus is Zedge marketplace subscription and you also get another different type of subscription just for being ad free for, are they the same and then your paid subscribers were flat sequentially do you think that that number can can continue to grow sequentially? Thank you.Brian SiegelSo that plus is our subscription offering. Our subscription offering has a bundle together. Several value adds up one of those value adds, is it free as you described it, but then if there are additional value adds in there, whether it be both that can be used for creating a I images ahm as an example. And insofar as a potential growth of number of subscribers, our aspiration is clearly to see to it that that subscription number grows over time and there is ongoing work with respect to how to make that subscription offering, whether it be on Android or on IOS even more attractive. If I were to provide a metaphor when you think about Amazon. So Amazon has overnight delivery, but they also offer a wealth of other value ads, whether it be content, whether it be storage and so on. And so forth. And as I said, as a metaphor, that is the work that we are heavily invested in terms of saying to us that we can continue to make the subscription offering even more attractive than what exists today. And going back to the overhaul that we had introduced in 2023, that was a lot of improvements in terms of those value adds, making that subscription offering more attractive and ultimately bringing in new subscribers.Yi TsaiThank you. In terms of a major TV, I don't know if you've provided any numbers in terms of did it grow over year over year as a result, I'm not sure if you're able to provide revenue also, you said the new actions you'd like to add mentioned some things like emoji mash-ups, emotive times, and I'm probably saying around KO. emojis.Brian SiegelCould you just tell me what mash-ups and payer markets are saying, I'm sure these are new content just to keep it simple, these are new content forms. But by way of example, on when today, one renders a smiley emoji and they can either have a smiley face in yellow and so on and so forth or they can type of coal and a closed frenzy. That is a contrast with the text strings that connote a various messages are, and that is a potential direction for us to add as a new content vertical within a motor PDR. And that's one of many in terms of numbers, I'm going to hand off to you to answer your question, Alan.Yi TsaiSo he moved to PDR. The second quarter call was not as great as we had hoped for. But if you look at the six months, we still grew that 27%. For three months ended January, we only grew about 8%.Allen KleeThank you. And then one of the areas that I think you mentioned as a priority is on monthly trying to grow monthly active users that was up slightly sequentially, which which is encouraging. Pat, could you maybe just highlight some of the key things you're focused on to get that number to start growing again?Brian SiegelSure. So we have a couple of activities that are taking place. We put together what I'll call a task force of rank and file their complaints with out a management participation that are working on some various feature enhancements, new features and potentially complementary products that would unlock growth. And then separately, we are also looking at ways of reimagining are they Zedge app or benefiting from the installed base that we have got to help fuel additional growth, whether that be through product marketing, incentive plans, influencer type of job of end referral plans. And then, of course, separate and apart from that on user acquisition investments and all of those taken together, we we are hoping that we can reverse that trend and see to it that we unlock what we believe to be on a promising growth opportunities on an annual escalator at.Yi TsaiSo I would just like to, as we mentioned, even though our active subscribers stayed flat at 648,000, but we are replacing low value solution with a higher value from the lifetime subscription as well as suppressing. So although the active subscribers remain the same, but our revenue base, what's much higher?Brian SiegelThank you.Allen KleeA yes, that's a good point. Thank you. Then on through Charles City, a couple of questions. My personal experience, and I'm a bad example, not being that savvy in this stuff, but on it's hard to be a newbie to when you first get on, it seems difficult to know how to engage, you know, and it tells you, you know, you can engage in a bunch of things until you get to a certain level. So maybe what you're doing to change that. And then also talk a little about what the the turbo feature, what that actually is and the new feature you're going to add and then why multiple virtual currencies some should help you out. Thanks.Brian SiegelThank you, Allen. And a point very well taken with respect to onboarding, as you said, a newbie that downloads good shots today, it is immediately immerse in the full game as they enter into a competition, they can be competing against up to 7,000 other photographers that are in that our competition with a dashboard that has a lot of numbers and features to it. So a user has to be exceptionally loyal and very, very insistent on saying they're going to figure this thing out. Our overhauling onboarding will allow for us too simplify the game plan such that we get users into that funnel immediately, which opens up the top of the funnel, hopefully expand for plate, the potential player base and also allows for folks that may think that they are not good photographers, making this accessible to them. And then with progression as users begin to master skills and so on and so forth, they will then gain again, exposure to additional features. Our that contribute to making in-play more competitive and fun and so on and so forth. In addition to that, the onboarding will on have an element to it to that makes the game more or I guess, shorter in duration. So a typical photo challenge today, Inder shops can range in duration from one to several days. The notion of going through that onboarding feature will be to decrease that to you know, it could be 30 minutes. It could be an hour or it could be two hours and so on and so forth with respect to our changing the economy. The economy today is a rigid economy. There are three game resources that users can benefit from while playing the game and the way to access those game resources is through a hard in-app purchase event. If you buy resource A., it does not have any relevance to resource BOC to master the game. You really need to have a portfolio of those three resources and migrating to a coin based on economy, which has multiple currencies allows for a lot more flexibility. And it also allows for us to some reward every player in the game. Meaning if you are playing a game today and you don't come in first, second or third place, that means you don't feel that great about yourself, even though you may have come in for which is 6,996 in terms of your ranking, our ability will be with this new our Coinbase economy proceeded with the every player, even a player that ranks lowest of those 7,000, we'll be able to get a reward and ultimately use that reward in one way, shape form or another or use those rewards in order to potentially gain an edge. With respect to game resources, as I mentioned during my comments, we've made changes to the product team and the product team is now very, very well resourced with a community of product managers that come out of some of the most well-known global gaming companies that have experienced not only in a gaming design, user experience, user interface, but also in gaming economies and what can be done in order to optimize those economies, ultimately leading to better revenue generation as well as contributing to improving user engagement and user retention in totality. Our hope and expectation is that taken together that will unlock the growth that we believe is inherent in this asset in terms of content, the new features, the new features most immediately are around offering what I will call mini game battles for users that are already in the middle of the game and then and now beginning to expand that too, and just being a standalone short term, limited number of competitors type of battle. Again, allowing for this to be a quick win for users to get that dopamine flow and feel like, wow, they're competing in real time without having to wait for an extended period of time in order to ultimately win a battle. And in addition to that, also decreasing the number of people that they're competing against, therefore increasing the chances that they can actually win. And again, that escalated accordingly. Does that answer your question?Allen KleeNo, that was very thorough. Thank you. From just some updates on AI. heart Master, can you provide an update on that?Brian SiegelSure. So a master remains in soft launch. So we made the decision to keep it in soft launch. While we are hard at work at unlocking the growth in the core guru shots game and we continue to gather data. Our plan currently is that when we get to crew change its trajectory and the direction and that we believe will allow for this growth that we will then refocus efforts and resources on AIR. master. We just don't want to spread ourselves so thinly that were not progressing the GURU shouts game and that as we evolve, it will take time to watch this AR master game as we iterate and so on and so forth. So focusing on getting one thing gone really, really well and then progressing to the next thing, which would be a our master or master now is at a point where we are able to monitor the data. That data is going to be exceptionally valuable in terms of helping guide what our future direction is with that game and how it evolves.Allen KleeGot you. Okay. And then probably I'm guessing a similar answer answer from the past call, you talked about potentially launching hybrid casual game. Is that kind of in the same status or --Brian SiegelAI. art Master is in that hybrid casual category those those are not separate and distinct from one another.Allen KleeOkay, got it. Thank you on. Okay. And then, um, question on financials. The jump in SG&A for the quarter is the ways I look at that. To what degree do we think of that as like on finance that this is a seasonally strong quarter versus some of the other things you talked about perhaps a good acquisition or some of the new well, it's ISG. and you brought on some more people. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of it is maybe seasonal versus revenue run rate for SG&A?Brian SiegelI would actually reframe that a little bit. SG&A includes marketing. So there are two components of that number one is actual money that we have spent on paid user acquisition, as I've said in the past, in order to scale paid user acquisition, when looking at budgets, there is going to be steady state on this platform. This particular campaign works. We continue investing in it, but there is obviously a ceiling there. And then there is what we'll call test budgets for you trying new platform, you're trying new creatives and stuff like that and some of that stuff works. Some of that does not need both components in order to scale pay user acquisition. But then there is also the fee that we pay to, whether it be Apple or Google when we bring on a subscriber or when a user makes an in-app purchase. So those two components taken together contributed materially to the increase in SG&A. And the way I sort of look at it is if we're successful in growing our subscriber base. If we're successful in generating more in-app purchases, SG&A goes up, that's actually a good reason for SG&A to go up as opposed to. We're not managing our expense for infrastructure properly minute By way of contrast, EVM, anything that you want to add to that.Yi TsaiBut yes, I'll only add a pattern of FT. remain quite stable in all net compensation expenses to be in line with last year. So all the increase in exiting a Jonathan mentioned is in the marketing spend and also the pipeline we see one of the downside than we were a lifetime subscription runs from Google Play's point of view, it's just one and done. So they traded at a in their purchase just so we pay a 30% fee rather than a vigorous appreciating, which is at 15% fee. So as a result on our platform fee went up by virtue of our rolling out a lifetime subscription?Allen KleeGreat. Okay. Congrats again and thank you so much.Brian SiegelThank you.OperatorThis does conclude our question and answer session and the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

2024-03-15T15:17:18.000Z,ESPN-Fox-WBD joint sports venture names ex-Apple exec as CEO,"The new sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA) just found its new CEO: former Apple and Hulu executive Pete Distad.Distad, who most recently served as an executive at Apple (AAPL) for a decade following six years at Disney's Hulu, will assume oversight of all aspects of the joint venture, including overall strategy, distribution, marketing, and sales, according to a press release.The streaming service, announced last month, is set to debut sometime this fall and comes at a time when media companies are facing increased pressure from investors to scale their platforms and achieve profitability.The unnamed platform will bring together the three companies' respective slates of sports networks. Collectively, the new service encompasses about 55% of US sports rights, according to Citi Research.""Pete is an accomplished innovator and leader who has extensive experience with launching and growing new video services,"" the three companies said in a joint statement. ""We are confident he and his team will build an extremely compelling, fan-focused product for our target market.""While at Apple, Distad was responsible for the business, operations, and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts, including the launch of streaming service Apple TV+.Notably, he helped scale the fledgling platform as it worked to compete with more established players. He was also involved in Apple's eventual $2.5 billion acquisition of MLS season pass in 2022.""This is an incredible opportunity to build and grow a differentiated product that will serve passionate sports fans in the US outside of the traditional pay TV bundle,"" Distad said in the release. ""I’m excited to be able to pull together the industry-leading sports content portfolios from these three companies to deliver a new best-in-class service.""Earlier this month, Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said the service will be priced on the higher end of estimates with subscribers expected to hit around 5 million by 2029. Wall Street has estimated the price point will come in between $40 and $50 a month.The companies have yet to reveal when they will release exact pricing information.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2024-03-16T12:30:00.000Z,Qualcomm's Powerful PC Chip Is Worse for AMD Than for Intel,"In the world of PC CPUs, the x86 architecture reigns supreme. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are the only two companies outside of China able to design x86 processors destined for PCs.There have been efforts to break the x86 stranglehold, but until recently, they've fallen short. A version of the Windows 8 operating system ran on Arm-based chips, and Microsoft even released variants of its Surface tablet about a decade ago powered by them.The big problem was compatibility. Applications compiled for standard x86 Windows wouldn't work. This created confusion among consumers expecting to be able to download whatever applications they wanted. The product and Arm-based Windows were mostly dead on arrival.Apple is the only success story so far, thanks to its complete control over hardware and software for its Mac PCs. The company began switching from Intel CPUs to custom Arm-based CPUs in 2020, providing a translation layer called Rosetta that enabled old applications compiled for Intel-based Macs to run on new Arm-based Macs. The switch has given Apple an important edge over Windows laptops in terms of battery life.For Microsoft, keeping Apple in check requires PCs to get better, particularly on the efficiency and battery-life fronts. While Intel made progress with its Meteor Lake chips launched late last year, more competition is likely necessary to push Windows PCs forward.Microsoft has been once again trying to push an Arm-based version of Windows, this time with Windows 11 and a translation layer that enables traditional Windows applications to run. There are some laptops already available running Arm-based chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), although they fall short in terms of performance. There are still some compatibility issues, and emulating x86 apps introduces a performance penalty that noticeably slows things down.Microsoft and Qualcomm aren't giving up. Qualcomm's next-generation PC CPU, the Snapdragon X Elite, may be powerful enough to overcome the performance gap with traditional laptops when it starts showing up in devices in mid-2024. There are even rumors circulating that Microsoft will announce a new Surface laptop later this month packing one of Qualcomm's new chips.In early pre-release testing, the Snapdragon X Elite has put up some impressive results. Tom's Hardware recently reported that some benchmarks taken at an official Qualcomm event during the Mobile World Congress paint a rosy picture for the upcoming Arm-based chip. Up against Intel's Core 7 Ultra 155H, the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite held its own in some tests, while beating the Intel chip by wide margins in others.While it will take time for Arm-based laptops to win over consumers, it seems inevitable that the PC CPU duopoly's days are numbered. More competition is bad news for both Intel's and AMD's PC CPU businesses.However, Intel has a way to benefit from Arm-based PC chips proliferating, while AMD does not. Intel may lose PC CPU market share, but its foundry business could eventually be pumping out Arm-based PC chips for Qualcomm and others.Intel expects to surpass semiconductor foundry leader TSMC technologically early next year with its Intel 18A process, which packs a new transistor design and will be the first process node to use backside-power delivery, which can boost power efficiency. This will be particularly important for chips aiming to maximize battery life.Intel and Arm Holdings struck a deal last year to co-optimize the Arm architecture and the Intel 18A process. Intel has scored some Arm-based design wins -- notably, a server chip using Arm Neoverse cores. If Arm-based PCs take off, the downside of potentially losing share in the PC CPU market can be offset by design wins in the foundry business.AMD doesn't manufacture its own chips, so increased competition in the PC CPU market is all downside. The company is already in a distant second place in the PC CPU market with a unit share of about 20%. Viable Arm-based PCs powered by CPUs from Qualcomm and potentially others -- Nvidia is rumored to be working on PC chips -- will eat away at that market share.One could argue that Intel has more to lose, given that its PC CPU market share is much higher. That may be true, but it also has more to gain. As Intel pushes to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030, Arm-based PC chips are likely to roll off the company's assembly lines as its manufacturing technology catches up with TSMC.While Arm-based PCs introduce uncertainty for both Intel and AMD, they represent an opportunity for Intel, while only a risk for AMD.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2024-03-16T11:00:00.000Z,Can Nvidia Become the World's Largest Company?,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a candidate to overtake Microsoft and Apple as the largest company in the world. After starting 2023 being valued at around a $350 billion market cap, Nvidia is now worth about $2.2 trillion.That's a dramatic expansion in value and it puts it within striking distance of Microsoft and Apple, which are valued at around $3.1 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur.Nvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia. When AI demand started to take off during Nvidia's second quarter of 2023 (ending July 30, 2023), that's when its growth really started.In the last three quarters, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled compared to the previous year's results. For the current quarter, which is first quarter of fiscal year 2025, that trend is also expected to continue as management projects $24 billion in revenue -- a 234% projected increase.After Q1, Nvidia will have harder comparisons. However, if it can maintain its revenue levels in the mid-$20 billion range, it will still post strong growth, as Q2 and Q3 of FY 2024 saw $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion in revenue, respectively.But will that be enough to surpass Apple and Microsoft?If Nvidia can achieve its projection of $24 billion in revenue in Q1 and barely grow quarter over quarter throughout the year to attain $100 billion in revenue for FY 2025, that could set Nvidia up nicely.Using its Q4 profit margin of 55% as a baseline, Nvidia would produce $55 billion in profits. But how does that compare to Microsoft and Apple?The chart below shows the trailing 12-month (TTM) total of each company's net income. So, even if Nvidia achieves $55 billion in annual profit, it would still be far behind Microsoft and Apple.For Nvidia to surpass either company, investors would have to place a significant premium on the stock, reflected in an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Nvidia's P/E ratio is already much higher than that of Microsoft or Apple, as it trades for 77 times earnings versus Microsoft's 38 and Apple's 27.If Nvidia kept its 77 times earnings price tag with $55 billion in profit, it would be valued at $4.24 trillion, easily surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But that isn't likely.Nvidia's stock is valued at a premium because investors know that this figure will come down as it grows into its newfound business. So, the only way Nvidia will maintain its 77 times earnings premium at the end of this fiscal year is if it continues doubling or tripling its revenue each quarter.If Nvidia does that, it will have earned the title of the world's largest company. This seems a far stretch, considering that many GPU orders have already been placed.Will Nvidia overtake Microsoft or Apple in valuation? I'd say it's unlikely. But Nvidia has produced uncommon growth for the last three quarters, and if that trend continues over the next year, it has a shot at capturing the title of the world's largest company.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-16T13:03:00.000Z,Companies Paid a Record $1.7 Trillion in Dividends Last Year. These 3 Dividend Stocks Led the Way.,"According to a report by Janus Henderson Global, companies paid a staggering $1.7 trillion in dividends to their shareholders in 2023. That was a record amount of cash payments, 5% above 2022's total. Hundreds of companies helped drive the corporate sector's record dividend outlay. However, three rose to the top as the biggest payers: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). Here's a look at what they paid investors last year and whether these leading dividend stocks can continue enriching their investors through dividends. Microsoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, which was the most of any company. The technology titan is routinely one of the top dividend-paying stocks. It was the leader in 2020, placed second in 2021, and was third in 2022. It was able to reclaim its spot at the top by increasing its dividend (it boosted its dividend per share by 10% in each of the last two years). Meanwhile, the leader of the last two years, mining giant BHP Group, has paid less in dividends due to lower commodity prices. Microsoft can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the last six months, Microsoft has produced nearly $50 billion in net cash flow from operations while paying $10.6 billion in dividends. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74 billion in debt. That strong financial profile helps support its elite AAA credit rating. The technology company is also investing heavily in its growth, including acquiring gaming company Activision and developing AI technology with OpenAI. These and other catalysts should enable Microsoft to grow its cash flow, giving it even more money to pay dividends.Fellow tech giant Apple clocked in at No. 2, paying $14.9 billion in dividends last year. That was slightly more than it paid in 2022, thanks to dividend increases. Apple raised its per-share payment by 4.3% last year, following a 4.5% bump in 2022. Like Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its big-time payout. The technology giant produced $110.5 billion in cash from operating activities during 2023. It also boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. Apple ended the year with a jaw-dropping $162 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $111 billion of debt. That also allows the company to invest heavily in research and development to launch innovative products that drive revenue and cash-flow growth. It recently launched its Vision Pro VR headset and is starting to invest more heavily in generative AI. These growth drivers should enable Apple to produce more cash that it could use to pay dividends in the future.ExxonMobil was right behind Apple at around $14.9 billion in dividend payments last year. The oil giant has steadily increased its dividend. It raised its payment by 4.1% late last year, its 41st straight year of dividend growth. It also grew its payout by 3.4% in late 2022. The energy company produced a prodigious amount of cash last year despite lower oil and gas prices. Free cash flow actually increased by $1.9 billion last year to $36.1 billion, thanks to its focus on investing in high-margin capital projects. While ExxonMobil returned an industry-leading $32.4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, it still grew its cash balance to $31.6 billion. ExxonMobil's high-return investment strategy has it on track to double its earnings potential by 2027. On top of that, the company agreed to buy rival Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal worth more than $60 billion, which will further enhance its ability to grow its free cash flow. These and other catalysts should give ExxonMobil more than enough fuel to continue growing its monster dividend. Microsoft, Apple, and ExxonMobil led the world in dividend payments last year. The massive companies produce enormous cash flows, giving them the money to invest in growing their businesses, pay ever-increasing dividends, and maintain cash-rich balance sheets. Those features make them ideal stocks for those seeking very safe and steadily rising dividends.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
